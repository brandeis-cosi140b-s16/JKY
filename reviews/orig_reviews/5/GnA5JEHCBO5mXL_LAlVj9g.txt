We loved it!
The kimchi rice and pork belly musubi was so good.
The sliders were also very good if not some of the best fusion sliders I have had the opportunity to enjoy.
The nachos, a half order which is large enough for the four of us, are a game changer as far as nachos go.  The sauce is sooo good.
But the favorite dish for the four of us was the spicy pork enchiladas.  We will make the 300+ mile trip just for the enchiladas!
