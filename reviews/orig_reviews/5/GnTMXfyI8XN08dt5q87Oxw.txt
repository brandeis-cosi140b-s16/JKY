Leaving this review here because I couldn't find the Maryland Parkway location on Yelp yet, but that's the location I'm reviewing -

Allow me to describe this place in one word: OMNOMNOM. 

At first, I thought, great, just what we need, another taco/burrito/bowl place within walking distance of UNLV (others being Chipotle and Cafe Rio). We're also not needing in hawaiian food either. But, Braddahs knocked it out of the park. Hawaiian mexican might be a way to describe it? Whatever the style is, it was *good*. 

We were welcomed with samples to try the menu (they just opened this location within the past few days) - and were sold right there. I had a steak & chicken salad. Delicious. If I had one critique, it was that the pork by itself was a bit on the salty side, but I could see that being less of a problem in the context of other things on the plate. 

Then, coconut bark happened. If I wasn't already in love with the place, I am now.

The owner (I presume that who he was) was welcoming and personable, helping out the service team and greeting customers. It didn't feel fake-servicey like at Chipotle, where they look up and begrudgingly moan, "welcome to chipotle." 

TL;DR- Food is great. Coconut bark is amazing. Can't wait to go back (and for the Green Valley location to open.)
