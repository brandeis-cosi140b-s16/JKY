Love their queso fundido! I've come here plenty of times on my lunch break. Their shrimp and fish tacos are very tasty! They do come with rice and beans. I also love their chicken quesadillas,  they are very delicious!  My favorite dessert by far is their fried ice cream! SOOOOooo good! I always get good service and they always make sure to have me out by end of my break. Also, if you need a hangover fix get their Micheladas! The best pick me up ever! I had to drop by after work one day to fix myself! 

* great flavor in their chips and salsa!
