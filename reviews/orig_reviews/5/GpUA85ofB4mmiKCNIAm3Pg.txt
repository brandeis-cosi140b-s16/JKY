I will definitely be back whenever I'm in Vegas again. Found this place on yelp because I was craving a michelada to cure the alcohol withdrawal from punk rock bowling. 
My significant other and I shared oysters that were fresh, super clean and delicious. What I mean by clean is they did not taste like the ocean floor nor did they have any shell chips from being pried open. 
I had the shrimp cocktail which was ok-good but ok. My boyfriend had the camarones a la diabla which were perfect. Great flavor and not too spicy that he couldn't enjoy them. 
Micheladas were perfect! We also shared a shrimp empanada since the reviews on here all raved about them...they were not kidding. It was better than my cocktail. 

The restaurant was busy but service was good. They have a few televisions and even live music so it's also pretty loud; which if you're Hispanic you should be accustomed to that. LoL
