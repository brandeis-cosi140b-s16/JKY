Very good. 

I had two small tacos with tinga and mild chicken, after tasting them all. The green chili taster was also very good, but you really can't go wrong with anything here.

I'd recommend getting the normal sized tacos because you'll get all your toppings in easier.

Amazing prices for what you're getting
