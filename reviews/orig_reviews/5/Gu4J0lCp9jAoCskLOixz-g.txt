The spicy pork tacos are amazing!!!!!!! This is a must try place in Vegas. Regardless, if the rest of you meals are at 4 star restaurants this place is worth the trip. I only stay at the Encore so its near by but, even if you are staying at Mandalay Bay its worth the trip. I will eat every time I go to Vegas, which always happens at least one time a year.
