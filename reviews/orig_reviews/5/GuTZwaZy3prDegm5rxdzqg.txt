Make me smile. Aside from the 1970 classic Chicago tune (yes.... some people were actually around at that time!) these words are the ultimate compliment that I can pay to a chef and a restaurant. There are only a few places in the Valley that bring a smile to my face and relaxation to my brain. Sumo Maya is one of them. Chefs Matt Zdeb and Andy Suzuki are so incredibly skilled at what they do that even in the midst of this active atmosphere, I can take deep breaths and relax. The Kimchee Fried Rice (with firm grilled shrimp added as an option), and Arroz Con Pato have never missed a step and always provided just the right combo of all things tasty. The Crispy Calamari and the Bacon Wrapped Medjool Dates are just stupidly good.  German, Tai, Eli and Alex keep the engine purring and customers on top of their priority list. Even on this busy night (last  night, other businesses in the same area were having their own special events and parking was crowded), the smile was there. For those who have enjoyed this experience before, these observations really aren't that new. For those who have had less than a wonderful experience and especially those who have not yet been able to make the trip, I strongly recommend that you give this place a shot at earning your business and a happy face.  Peg and I smile a lot here.... Dr. B.
