I had the fish burrito and my man had the carne asada burrito. Both items were DELICIOUS! Each burrito came with rice and beans on the side.  I normally add salt to the beans and rice but these both had excellent flavor. The salsa's were amazing. I tried all of the 3 chili pepper hottt salsas and each one was very good. Def coming back!
