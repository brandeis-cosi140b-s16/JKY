We didn't know where to eat in Vegas (I know there are so many places to eat), and my brother-in-law suggested this place. A little drive from the strip but WOW was it worth it.

We started off with the wonton style tortilla chips. These aren't your normal tortilla chips, but they come with salsa and guacamole. Our party ordered bulgogi burritos, bulgogi tacos and chicken chow fun. All were amazing. The bulgogi burritos are a MUST! The bulgogi is cooked well and is complemented nicely with the sweet and hot sauce. Kristina ordered the bulgogi tacos and they were better than any bulgogi tacos that we've had. Make sure to try the bulgogi if you go. You won't regret it.

The biggest plus of this place is the PRICE! For 4 plates our dinner was under $30!!!!! Yeah, $30 big ones and we were all stuffed after. Totally worth the drive from the strip but be forewarned, this place is small. The staff is extremely friendly and kept checking up on us throughout our meal. 5 stars all around!
