The first time I went here, I ordered the carne asada burrito and fell in love with the place.  I had the Cochata which is coffee and horchata.  I hate horchata, but this concoction was amazing.  I love guacamole, and there are very few places that serve guacamole with only avocado and lime juices.  This is probably why I love the burrito so much.  They also offer guacamole with tomatoes and onions, but I will not touch any of that.  The second time I went, however, my burrito did not taste as good, and neither did my cochata.  I was a little disappointed, but I do understand that different people work every day.  I will definitely keep coming here.  I wish they would open a bigger one!
