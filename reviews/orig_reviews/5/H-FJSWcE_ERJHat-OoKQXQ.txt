This is one of my favorite restaurants ever, and I love the south Phoenix location.  My favorite is the adovada relleno.  The relleno is delicious and the adovada is perfection, slow roasted, flavorful and tender.  Pretty much everything here is spicy (recommend a margarita to curb the fire!  I love the mango and the prickly pear), but I think there are a few things (chicken, shrimp) that aren't too spicy.  

Everything here is cheesy and saucy and just perfect.  Another favorite is the beef enchiladas with an egg on top.  Weekends are busy, expect to wait if you arrive after 6pm, but get a drink and some chips and salsa and hang out in the courtyard.  Weeknights are less crowded.  (Except during spring training, when everything is crowded!)
