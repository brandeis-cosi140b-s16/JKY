BEST chips and tableside guac ever. Huge tequila selection. This is not your typical Mexican; Chef Silvana is a James Beard nominated chef and a visionary. I've enjoyed blue corn lobster enchiladas before, and they have fantastic mole!! Super cool art all around, cool bathrooms with beautiful crosses and Mexican colors. Live music sometimes, and the service has always been great for me. Celebrated my birthday there with 12 people, so despite the quaint & cozy size of the restaurant, it is possible to have a large party as long as you give them ample notice. **Note: you can not park in front of the restaurant; you must park behind (VERY FEW spaces) or on a side street. So the parking sucks, but this place is SO worth it!!! Can't wait to go back.
