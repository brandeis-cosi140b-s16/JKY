I was there few days ago with my husband first time  there , very impressed with the restaurant and decor, we had few appetizer and some excellent margaritas at the bar , the bartender was from chile and gave us an excellent service at the bar , is our new favorite bar in Vegas we are definitely coming back with friends and family..
I don't usually comment about service and a great experience , but now I think they deserve to be recognized !!
