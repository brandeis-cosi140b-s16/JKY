I've only been there two times and I already love this place! Great atmosphere and the food is really good. Reasonably priced too! They even have live music, which I really appreciate and hope they never change. 

But the outstanding star of the show is the bartender Gretchen. She should be giving lessons to all other bartenders in Las Vegas on how the job should be done! Even though I'm not a "regular" she always called me by name, consistently made eye contact and checked in on me to make sure I had everything I needed. She was super friendly and made great recommendations on the food, She has a great sense of humor, and knows how to take care of her guests. She made the whole experience amazing!
