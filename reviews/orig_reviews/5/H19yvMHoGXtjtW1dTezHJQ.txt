If you're thinking to yourself, "aw man, it's just mexican food, there are a thousand mexican restaurants in Phoenix," stop whatever you're doing, come to Tacos Atoyac, and try some awesome, authentic mexican food.  This place is unassuming, in a "blink-and-you'll-miss-it" kind of way, but do not judge this book by its cover.  Try it, love it.
