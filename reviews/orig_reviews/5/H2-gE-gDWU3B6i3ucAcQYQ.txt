My favorite Mexican food in Vegas. Don't let it being next to sapphires scare you. The atmosphere is subtle and comfortable. The food is all non gmo which is hard to find in Las Vegas. The executive chef Pako is always dedicated to the food and customers. I highly recommend this place and tell everyone about it
