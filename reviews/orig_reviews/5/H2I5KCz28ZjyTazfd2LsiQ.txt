I love this place. I've taken everyone I know and love here. And no complaints from anyone so far. My Anglo friends like the food and so does mi familia.  Most people who are only famliar with Americanized Mexican food will not understand what is going on here. And those haters out there that think Mexican cuisine cannot be a fine dining experience, you can keep your 2 for 1 tacos made from questionable meat sources. If you'v visited different regions in Mexico besides Baja, Rocky Point and Cancun, you'll appreciate the regional dishes at this restaurant and the inventive use of ingredients and crazy flavors. The Chiles en Nogada and the Pato en Tamarindo are my favs. And with over 200 tequilas to taste, I look forward to tryng something new every visit.
