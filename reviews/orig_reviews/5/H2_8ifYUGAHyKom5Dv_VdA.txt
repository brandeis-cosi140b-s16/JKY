Very good!!!  I have been coming to Asi Es La Vida for the past 1 1/2 years and every time I walk in I am greeted with a happy face and a warm smile.  They make you feel like you are at home.  The food is very delicious I have tried most everything on the menu and have yet to find anything that I dislike.  There is live music everyday except for Wednesday, I believe; the music is played my one man and his guitar.  He always plays beautiful music and you can even request songs and if he knows them he will play them.

There are two seating areas in the restaurant one where the live music is played and the other is to the left as you walk in the door.  They are always specials of the day from the appetizers to the main entree.  I am a big fan of the Carne Tampiquena and my girlfriend loves a dish they will make if you request it, at the moment I am not sure of its name but it has fish and it is covered in a cream sauce, it too is very delicious.

While the live music is being played you will start to feel very relaxed and not rushed like some restaurants can make you feel.  They don't try to rush you, they want you to feel welcome and enjoy your time with them.  I like that you aren't served a bowl of chips and salsa like typical cheap mexican restaurant serve.

If you are thinking about going to this place I strongly recommend that you try it and you will fall in love with the atmosphere, food and the friendly people that work there.  Oh it is a little on the expensive side but worth every penny.  ENJOY!!!  I have been told that you can bring your own bottle of wine and seen some people bring their own because they don't have a liquor license yet.
