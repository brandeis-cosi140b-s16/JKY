Great food, cool setting. This place is in Sunbrite Corner (NW corner of 16th & Bethany Home).  No street signage I could find.  Park at Luci's and it is in suite just north. Polished copper tables.  Wonderful spicy breakfast dishes.  Endorphins will be released!  Bloody Mary was awesome and served with a beer chaser.  Great for cooling off after the food, but frankly great for cooling off after the Bloody Mary itself.  Will definitely be returning.  Next time - adovada benedict.
