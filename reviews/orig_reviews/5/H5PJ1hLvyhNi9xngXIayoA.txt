My family and I came here for dinner. We had heard awesome things about it and wanted to check it out. First off, if you're getting margaritas it is so worth it to get the pitcher. It serves four perfectly. The red sangria and El Dorado margaritas are great. I had the carnitas street tacos for dinner. They were amazing. The rice is good too. I tried my husband's chicken enchiladas and they were amazing. The rest of my party tried the carne asada burritos, beef enchiladas, and carne street tacos and really enjoyed it all. Marco is an awesome waiter and takes great care of you! We were also pleasantly surprised that Chef Paco and the general manager stopped by our table to check on us. I definitely recommend and will definitely go back!
