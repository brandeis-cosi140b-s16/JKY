My Dad and I went to get some latin food.  I have been before so I knew what to expect.  This place has really good authentic food at a really good price.  

I got the Posole which was excellent and a huge portion and I got a beef tamale.  I also had the cantaloupe drink and it was awesome.  

If you haven't been you gotta check this place out.
