I hear people all the time say "aww..its not real Mexican"...   I say... "if it isn't.. I don't care".  This is great food folks.  Awesome flavors and a great atmosphere.  Bring the kids or go to watch the game.  Excellent buffet lunch too.   I think they've got the best chips in the western hemisphere.
