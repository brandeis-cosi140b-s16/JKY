I've never had anything bad at Sabor.  Some of my favorites have been the grilled chicken tacos and the arepas.  A friend swears by the shredded chicken but I'm not even sure why it exists when grilled is an option.  If you order a burrito you can ask that they press it on the grill which makes it's extra killer.  

They do have some issues with keeping the place clean but I don't really care as the food it awesome.  Also the pink sauce from the salsa bar is hot as hell, be careful with it.
