I tried this place based on other yelp reviews and I am glad I did! In a strip mall just past the Wynn Hotel, it is easily missed as somewhere to try but, stop in and try their food. $2.00 street style taco's so full of meat. We tried the carne asada and the spicy pork, both were so flavorful. We also ordered the carne asada fries, man this could feed a whole family. $10.00 but worth it. You will be sharing. Fresh food, made on the spot. Friendly, friendly service! It is seems to always be busy but the lines move very quickly so don't let the crowd deter you. Everything had so much flavor!
