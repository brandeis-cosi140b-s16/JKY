This is, by far, the best comida casera (homemade food) in the east valley. I recently took my wife for the first time and she loved it. The food is made with fresh ingredients with great skill.   They have this chicken/spinach enchilada plate ($7.95) that is excellent and highly recommended. Can't say too much about this place. Staff is great and food hits the spot every time.
