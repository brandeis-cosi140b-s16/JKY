Hand down the best tacos I've ever had and they are only $1.00 you can't beat that. The ingredients are fresh and flavorful. We has both the Pollo (Chicken) and the Asada (Beef) tacos along with the Asada Quesadilla which was Huge! And we also got the Super Mucho Nachos which was massive and had tons of gooey cheese. It's open for all you late night party goers that want late night eats....this is the place to go!
