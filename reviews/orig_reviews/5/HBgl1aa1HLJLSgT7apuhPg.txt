I seriously have no idea why the average is SO low for this restaurant. I have been to China Poblano twice now, and it can't get better than this!  I am a foodie and know good food when I eat it, so please take this review to heart!

China Poblano is a "nice casual" Chinese/Mexican fusion restaurant at the beautiful Cosmopolitan Hotel in Las Vegas.  I have never stayed here, but I can just imagine how beautiful the rooms must be, given the interior of the hotel's main floor.  China is a very eclectically designed restaurant, definitely great for striking up some interesting conversation topics.

Allow me to rate what I have eaten there.  Everything has been amazing!!

Queso Fundido - THIS IS A MUST if you like cheese.  One of the best queso dishes I have EVER tried, complete with handmade, fresh tortillas!
Chilaquiles - Delicious and filling...not necessarily sure you need to get this if you are getting the queso fundido, as it is the same cheese.
When Pigs Fly - Awesome "dim sum" style pork buns...yum!
Beijing Glass Noodles - Wonderful cold noodle dish, sort of like a noodle salad...that might not sound that intriguing, but this is a must try as well
Papas Fritas with Mole Poblano, Mexican Cream, and Queso Fresco - A great fries dish not to be missed!
Twenty-vegetable fried rice - This is what they are famous for.  It's good, but not my fave of what I have tried.

People I have gone with tried the pork street sandwich...they were underwhelmed.  They also tried the Dan Dan Mian noodles.  I had a bite and they were really good!  I have also heard that the guacamole is just okay (like any other table side guacamole), but I still plan to try it one day.

This is my go-to restaurant for Friday nights in Vegas...definitely give this one a try!
