After going here once, this place has easily become one of my favorite places to eat in Vegas. My friends and I came here once for lunch after a night at EDC since it was a short walk from Circus Circus.

We arrived at about 2:30pm and the lines were out the door. There were multiple lines: one for carne asada (beef), one for adobada (spicy pork) and one for lengua (beef tongue) + everything else. My friends and I all split into different lines. The adobada and carne asada line took ~45 mintues to order, whereas the lengua line didn't even take 15.

I ended up asking my friends to get me something from each line.

Carne Asada Fries ($10): The beef itself was really good. Super tender and just absolutely melts in your mouth. The fries, on the other hand, were nothing special. The fries comes with cheese, sour cream and guacamole (although I don't think we got the guac.)

Adobada Taco ($2) and Quesadilla ($4): Easily my favorite. Definitely worth the wait for this. The spicy pork was probably the best I've ever tasted at any Mexican restaurant. It was the right amount of spicy and OMG was it juicy.

Lengua Taco ($2.25): The lengua here is a really close second to the adobada. The meat is super juicy (like all the others lol) and there is a lot of flavor.

Pork Shoulder Taco ($2): My least favorite out of all the meats, but still really good. It's basically like pulled pork, I would say. There isn't as much flavor in this compared to the other meats, but still, the meat melts in your mouth.

Even though waits can be long, I would absolutely come back here. It's SO cheap for the amount that they give you.

Notes:
- They give a lot of toppings on EVERYTHING.
- You order the food at the counter and then pay at the registers by the door. Kinda awkward when there's hella people in line and you're just trying to get through to pay.
- Open super late Fridays and Saturdays.
