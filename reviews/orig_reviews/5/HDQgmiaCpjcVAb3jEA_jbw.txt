Love this place. Nice restaurant to dine solo or bring the family. It is typical Sonoran fare with New Mexico dishes and hatch chiles also on the menu. 
Terrific bean dip with your chips, along with 3 other dips.

If you've eaten red chile, chile con colorado, chile con carne, etc. at other places in the valley, try the Red chile con carne here. Excellent flavor and made with pork, not beef.

As to the question does Si Senor merit being a "regular stop" on the list? Having been to most Mexican restaurants in the valley at least once, Si Senor is easily better than the second rate fare dished out at east valley Garcia's, Serrano's, etc. and it's a nice atmosphere. Give it a go, no disappointments here.
