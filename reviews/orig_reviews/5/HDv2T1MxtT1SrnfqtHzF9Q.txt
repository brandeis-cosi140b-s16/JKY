Wow. The food here is amazing! So far I have tried the Bulgolgi Burrito, flautas, chimichanga and Tacos. They are all delicious, but I'd have to say the simple burrito and taco are my favorite. A basic burrito with Bulgolgi...sounds so simple but it works deliciously well together. The man who is always in the front is a little grumpy. He never smiles and seems to be in a bad mood every time. The other people are really nice though. Regardless. I absolutely love the food and will be coming back many many times!
