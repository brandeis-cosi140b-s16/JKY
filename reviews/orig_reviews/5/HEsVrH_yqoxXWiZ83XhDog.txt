íMuy Delicioso!  My Buddy and I were looking for a post-workout meal to enjoy with the underlining reason being that it was Tuesday.  As any good hungry person would think, Taco Tuesday.  We found Tacos Sahuaro and noticed that Yelpers loved this place.  We came and it definitely had the look of an awesome hole-in-the-wall taco shop which gave me a sense of ease and excitement.  I decided to get 4 tacos, even though the quesadilla and the tortas looked awesome.  I was sad to hear they were out of the pollo asado, but i take that as it must have just been delicious.  I instead got the Carne Asada, Pastor, Lengua, and Chicharron.  All were just absolutely FANTASTIC!  I was pleased to see that they either fry their tortillas or they're just housemade b/c they were just awesome!  The texture was thicker than usual, but still nice and soft and and just tasted fresh.  I will say that my least favorite of my four was the Chicharron, the reason being was that the skin was not crispy as I had initially expected.  The skin was soft and perhaps I am mistaken that it was supposed to be fried, but that was my reasoning behind that.  The pastor or the lengua were probably my favorite.  The flavors of each are just so distinct and are just on point.  They also have the verde y rojo sauce which are both on point and last but not least they gave us a bowl of limes and cucumbers which enhanced the flavors just that much more.  I will definitely be going back for some delicious Mexican food :) 

¡Salud!
