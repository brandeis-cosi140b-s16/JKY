I had brunch with my husband at Mad Mex a few months ago. It was great and I can't wait to go back! They are very accommodating to vegetarians and vegans - most things can be modified for various diets. My husband is a meat-eater and he also loved his meal. It has a really fun atmosphere, generous portions, and reasonable prices. They do seem to get really busy at times, so you may want to have a back-up plan if you're in a hurry, but otherwise I highly recommend it!
