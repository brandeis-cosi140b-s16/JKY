This a great place!  Some of the best Mexican food I have ever had!  Ordered the chicken enchiladas and WOW! The service was also the best I have experienced in a long time in Vegas!  Highly recommend.  Great place to go eat on First Friday or before a show at The Smith Center.  Give it a try.  You won't regret it.
