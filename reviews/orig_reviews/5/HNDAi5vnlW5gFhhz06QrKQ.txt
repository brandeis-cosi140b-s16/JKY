Very very good.  
Came at a slow time after lunch (which can sometimes catch a restaurant staff sleeping on the job) but was greeted by a very attentive waiter and waitress.  My waitress even offered to ice my left-overs as I wasn't going directly home.  Knowledgable, accommodating, and very friendly staff. 
Had the Fish Taco Special and the Tres Leches to follow. 
Fantastic. A great and fresh spin on traditional Mexican fare. 
Will definitely be back.
