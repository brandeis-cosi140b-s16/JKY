Si Senor is my favorite Mexican food restaurant. I love that you get four different dips with the chips and all four are wonderful. You can't get anything like the sour cream salsa at any other restaurant. I have liked every meal that I have tried. The rice is cooked  well and has the perfect spices. In addition to the amazing meal, you get a sopapilla at the end. The service has always been kind and attentive. My husband and I go at least once a month.
