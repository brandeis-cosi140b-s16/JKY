This is a hidden gem in Las Vegas. It is hard to find unless you know where to look but the search is worth it. It sounds like a strange combination of Mexican and Korean but it makes for some fabulous tastes. The food is cooked fresh and the portion sizes are huge! My wife had the Bulgogi Chimichanga and we couldn't believe how big it was and how great it tasted. I had the Carne Asada and it was very authentic not the typical Tex-Mex style Mexican food that generally gets served. Since everything is made fresh, you can add or take away from any of the dishes. This will definitely be a regular stop for us.
