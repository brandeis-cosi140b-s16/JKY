Reasonable prices for delicious food and great service here. My boyfriend and I first dined here a few weeks ago and it's our new favorite Mexican restaurant. It's even better than our beloved Frank & Fina's in Summerlin. The food is amazzinnggg. I have nothing else to say except to be sure to order the guacamole. The servers bring the ingredients to your table and make the guacamole right in front of you so it's fresh. You can also choose to have the flavor taste mild, medium, or hot. Also, try to come early or request a table with a Strip view. The far side of the restaurant behind the bar has a stunning view of the Strip. Definitely recommend to anyone in the mood for great, authentic Mexican food.
