Great food. Great carne asada burritos with a whole wheat option (Chipotle oddly still doesn't offer this) and you get a free side of chips (Chipotle doesn't do that either). Seems to be more of a take out place at night but they offer good happy hour and late happy hour specials. Really like this place.
