This is by far one of the better Mexican restaurants in Phoenix. It's location is not desirable for some, but it is well worth going to and enjoying some good food. The lines can get crazy at times, but it is a popular place by all.

You cannot go wrong by visiting this place and sampling the food. Take some tortillas with you, too, if you get the chance.
