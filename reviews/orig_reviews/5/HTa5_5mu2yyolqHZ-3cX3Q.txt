I get the same thing every time I come here; Carne Adovada. Once you've had the best, why downgrade? The Carne Adovada meat is succulent and tender and melts in your mouth. The red sauce gives it heat but doesn't overpower. The beans and rice are an added bonus. My mouth is watering right now thinking about it!

And their Bloody Mary's.......they are on my top 5 list of best Bloody Mary's I have ever had....anywhere!
