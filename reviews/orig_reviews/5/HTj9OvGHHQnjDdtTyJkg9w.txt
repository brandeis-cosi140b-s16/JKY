Im not going to lie i love this place. Now id never go there when it wasnt happy hour but thats because they have the best happy hour in town. We are talking half price apps and 3 dollar margaritS and they have the best quesadill in town. No shit, you need to get the quesadilla, its like 3.50 and its a fat quesadilla. Smoky chicken chipotle that is juicy and just the boss rick ross.the taquitos are bomb and youll find my ass in there on a tuesday because its shrimp taco tuesday and shit gets real. Dont get the diablo taco cuz the fried one is just fantastic.
