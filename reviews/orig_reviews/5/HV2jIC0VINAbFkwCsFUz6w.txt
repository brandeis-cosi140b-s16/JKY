We discovered Barrio Queen a few years ago and have loved it ever since. Barrio Queen always has rotating happy hour specials on tacos and a great Taco Tuesday. Most of the time we sit at the bar, with great bartenders, delicious drinks, and close proximity to the kitchen its always a great experience. 

Highly recommend the tacos (3 for $10), street corn, and table side guacamole. If my stomach was bigger I would have every taco on the menu, but my favorites are: Carne, Chorizo, and Azul, Cochinita Pibil, and Suadero Azteca.
