Love love love this place, definitely my go to place for happy hour, I tried almost all the Margarita drinks they offer for happy hour and they were all good. My favorite is the Watermelon Margarita. Also, the tacos are so good, I have tried almost all of them as well and the ones I've tries so far are so good. Definitely, coming back to try everything else.
