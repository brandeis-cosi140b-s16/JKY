This is one of the best places to grab a burger and fries in the Phoenix / Scottsdale area.  I get my burger with cheese, onions and tomatoes - each ingredient is fresh and compliments the two beef patties perfectly.  I also get a side of fries and a lemonade - about the same price point as some other burger chains and much tastier IMHO.   Highly recommended.
