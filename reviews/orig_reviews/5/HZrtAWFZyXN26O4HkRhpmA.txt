We were standing in line at chipotle and decided we weren't really feeling it... Found this place (thanks yelp!) and were happy to!!! Friendly service, they give you a taste if it's your first time.  Family owned business and it shows! 

My friend had all the meat tacos and her fav was the steak... I had fish tacos and seaweed rice and am totally satisfied!

Nice atmosphere too with fun music... 

Will come back next time in town.
