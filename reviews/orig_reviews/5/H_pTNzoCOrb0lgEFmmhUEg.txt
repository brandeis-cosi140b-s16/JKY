Cannot love this place more. It does not look nice outside but the inside is amazing. A full Mexican experience. We had two fishes. One is whole fish and one is fish with salsa topped. Both are good! If you like crispy, the whole fish is what you want; if you like spicy, the salsa one is your choice!Just the service needs to be better, we wait for 15m to get water and drinks. A great place the hang out with friends. Also, the chips are bomb! They are served warm!! I love this place! Besides, it is near the ranch market. If you want to buy some grocery after a lunch or dinner, go there!!
