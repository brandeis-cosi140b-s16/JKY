Komex is a great restaurant with a nice and welcoming staff. If you love both Korean food and Mexican you can't go wrong with coming here. If you don't feel that adventurous have no fear Komex still offers more traditional Korean and Mexican dishes, which are still very good. The fusion is definitely the best part though! 

I highly recommend eating in, as they give you a basket of fresh homemade chips! Everything feels fresh and homemade. It's just a great place to eat, and you can tell your friends "Yeah, I had Komex for lunch."
