Exceptional. The food was astounding, the service is excellent, and the prices were very reasonable. They have a large section of vegetarian options, tried a few of them and was blown away at the taste! I didn't miss the meat at all! This restaurant is a gem! Not to be missed!!

Note, for those wary of the "Sweet Potato Enchiladas" the filling is chunks of potatos not a sweet potato mash, and they are excellent.
