If you happen to be walking drunk (or sober) around the strip , you need to visit Tacos El Gordo.  I made my first trip over here when staying at The Encore a few years ago, and now make an effort to visit whenever I can.  These are legit street tacos, at a very affordable price (especially compared to the other crap you'll get on the Strip).  Make sure to try the different type of rotisserie style meats, and grab a good amount of salsa and limes.  You'll wanna pass out after this.

Also, be prepared for the lines.  That's the only downfall.
