Ordered the following items: 1 Al Pastor Taco, 1 Carne Asada Taco, 1 Al Pastor Quesadilla and 1 Carne Asada Burrito. Also got the Cochatta drink.

Al Pastor items:
Great flavor and seasoning on the meat and the addition of grilled pineapple really perked up the dish. Food was not greasy or overbearing fatty. very very good
.
Carne Asada: I have eaten Carne Asada at many many restaurants and this was some of the best. Smoky flavor but still juicy and not dry. I am sure that as the grill seasons over time this Carne Asada will get even better

Cochatta: Mixture of ice coffee and Horchata. Cuts the acidity of the coffee and adds a nice sweet cinnamon flavor without being overbearing. Great Drink.

Overall I was impressed with the online ordering system, speed of food construction, and taste of the food. This place has replaced Chipotle and Fillaburtos as our quick Mexican food place of choice.
