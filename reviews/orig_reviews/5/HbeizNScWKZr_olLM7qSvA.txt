This is by far my favorite burrito spot in Arizona.  The ownership is awesome, and they remember our names every time we go in. My wife and I love ordering green chili burritos with green sauce, the food was hot and made fresh .  Last time I was in, Richie said "if you want gristle and fat in your burrito go to filibertos!"  What an awesome guy
