Definitely a great spot to go eat at Las Vegas! I went expecting a huge line because of the reviews I had read on yelp.. But the line was actually pretty short! I went around 6:30p on a Sunday. 
Pros - they make your food right in front of you so you get your food faster.

Cons - there's separate lanes for each different type of meat.

Oh! And the Adobada fries are MUCH better than the Carne Asada fries from Alberto's.. The meat doesn't have a bunch of fat like the meat in Alfredo's does.. 

Overall this is a spot to try! I am definitely coming back! :)
