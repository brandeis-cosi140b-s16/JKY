We ordered carne asada fries and chicken flatuas. THE FOOD WAS AMAZING !!! by far the best mexican food I've had in Las Vegas. Much better than robertos and tacos y tacos. The carne asada was tender and delicious stacked with crispy fries cheese, pico and guacamole. The chicken flatuas were for my children who devoured them. They came with crema gucamole and pico I only got one bite but the filling was delicious. We spent almost $25 for two menu items, one fountain drink and a bottle of water, a little pricey but definitely worth it. My only complaint is the restaurant is kinda small so navigating my stroller was difficult and it was too cold to eat outside more heat lamps pls !!
