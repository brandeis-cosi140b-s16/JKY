Eat here almost every week.  Great food and great tortillas all at a fantastic price.  The salsa seems to be made fresh daily and is always very consistently good.  Nice select of soft drinks and frescas.  Really enjoy the taco's and the combination #4.

The place can get a bit busy but not as crowded as the original location.
