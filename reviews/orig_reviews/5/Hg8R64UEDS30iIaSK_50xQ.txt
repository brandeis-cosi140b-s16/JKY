MMMMM, deliciousness wrapped in a tortilla.

Who can argue with such great food, atmosphere and service.  I've been multiple other locations for Mad Mex, but never been to this location prior to my most recent yearning for Mexican food.  

Even though parking is horrendous at this location being on a very busy street in Shadyside/East Liberty area, I still can't knock a star off for that.  Being here at a busy dinner time I expected to have at least a little wait.  Not so, we walked in, asked for a table for two and were seated immediately.  Almost immediately after sitting down our waiter was there to take our drink orders.  

I'm a bit of a creature of habit when I visit a Mad Mex location.  I'm in love with the a la carte tacos.  I mean it's too hard to choose from beef, steak or chicken...so why not get one of each.  I'm still amazed that they offer soy cheese and tofu sour cream, still can't taste the difference.  Of course I was amazed by my Big Azz Margarita as always and who can deny starting with chips and salsa.  

I loved how big it was in here too, lots of space to mingle about and great when the windows up front are opened.  Some outdoor seating is nice as well.  Very vibrant when walking in the area.
