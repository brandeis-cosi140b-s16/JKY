Love this place, it's one of my favorite restaurants. It's kind of hard to get to though if you aren't staying at MGM or the Signature. The table side guacamole and margaritas are excellent. 

I order the same thing every time I come here but never get bored of it - the shrimp tacos are my go-to. This place is also really fun to when you're with a big group, just make sure to make a reservation.
