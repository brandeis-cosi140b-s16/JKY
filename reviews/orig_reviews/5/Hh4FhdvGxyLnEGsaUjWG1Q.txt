I love this place and have been going for at least 20 years now. Probably longer, Eddie used to take a vacation over the summer and we would fill our fridge with tacos to hold us over.

Price for food is on par with everywhere now. People complain about taco prices but it's as reasonable as a Filibertos and the food is 10x better. 

Sure they charge a fee for credit cards but as a small business owner I understand. There isn't a ton of margin in food service and unless you rely on huge tabs or multi franchise merchant fee discounts they seriously cut into your bottom line. Easy enough to stop by the cash spitter before you get there.

Tips: The plain cheese quesadilla is amazing especially when topped with their chunky mild salsa. The chicken has a great flavor and the carne and pork aren't anything to dismiss. I usually order a cheese quesadilla, mix taco (beef and pork) and a chicken taco. Then decide what taco I want to eat there and then take one and half a quesadilla home.
