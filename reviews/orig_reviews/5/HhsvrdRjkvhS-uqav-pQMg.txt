This location is my favorite because the staff is FAST, EFFICIENT, and FRIENDLY!!  My tostada is always prepared just the way I like it.  They have a great crew who work coherently together to please their hungry customers.  I can't get enough of this place and would go breakfast, lunch and dinner if I could!  The best tasting, freshest, and healthiest salads to go or dine-in.  It's inexpensive and you get a ton of food for your $.

Don't forget to use your punch card every time you go and you'll receive the 10th meal free!
