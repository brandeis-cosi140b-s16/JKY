Well, folks . . . . It's all about the atmosphere.  Courtyard dining under festive  lighted trees.  Great, fresh Mexican plates and a vast assortment of our favorite tequilas.  The setting is casual and authentic.  We loved it.  Service was attentive and prices were very reasonable considering to volume of delicious food presented to dining guests.  The only thing missing was a strolling mariachi guitar band doing our favorite songs.  Loved all of it.  Treat yourself.  If on a date, if you don't score tonight, you need training, amigo.
