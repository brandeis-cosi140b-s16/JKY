I would recommend this place to anyone who can speak Spanish ...and anyone who likes Mexican food . place feels authentic enough where I felt out of place but nice enough where I was able to order without being too judged.  FYI me and my gf was the only Asian in fact I think the only non mexicans there.  I couldn't really understand what they were telling me but I just said yes to whatever.  They have 3 stations and you just kind of tell them what you want. Portions are small but cheap so you just orders a bunch. The Mexican version of dim sum I guess. The place is open late but can look pretty intimidating if you during the late hours
