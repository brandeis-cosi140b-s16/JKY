This is a GREAT, if somewhat pricey, Mexican restaurant. Entrees are in the $15-$20 range, and appetizers are around $10. But the food is fantastic. The complimentary bread and tomato/olive tapenade is great. I ordered the Enchiladas Hongos En Trufa: mushrooms, goat cheese, truffle oil, cream sauce, some zucchini and pico on top. It was great (and huge!). I'm vegetarian, and it was one of only a few things on the menu I could eat, but it was good enough that I'd go back, despite the lack of veggie variety.

I also had two house margaritas, which were great. Strong lime flavor, not too sweet. The waitress told me that the more premium margaritas are better because the lime juice is fresh, but these were good enough that I didn't want to upgrade.

The decor is rustic trendy. Not too fancy, but clearly decorated with care. Nice old wooden tables, leather and iron chairs, everything a little uneven in places. It's a great place.
