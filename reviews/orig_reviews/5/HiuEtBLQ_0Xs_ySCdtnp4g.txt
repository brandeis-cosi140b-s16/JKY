Ok this place is great, the micheladas really hit the spot after a massive hangover. It was 12 of us and surprisingly  we were seated immediately. I ordered an "aguachile" which is raw shrimp cooked in spicy lime juice garnished with sliced cucumbers and red onions, a dz oysters and a seafood stew. Ok ok I shared the oysters and aguachile with my brother in law.. The aguachile was really really good, the green chile is frkn amazing, the stew is definitely a hangover cure! this will be our new hangover cure spot in Vegas!
