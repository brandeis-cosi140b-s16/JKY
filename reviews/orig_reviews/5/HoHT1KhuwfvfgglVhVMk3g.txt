I always get the Camarones Tia Esther. It's been my favorite for years. Never disappoints. Today I had a hard day at work so I got a coconut margarita, too. It was very good. I've never been a fan of fideo but that's just me. The corn tortillas are made fresh on site and they're so good. 

I love this place!!
