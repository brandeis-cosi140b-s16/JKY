The best Mexican food in Vegas.  Best salsas (they have around 10 kinds).  The bartenders are AWESOME and fun, especially Jay.  Everyone is friendly, great service.  Love love love this place.  My only complaint is that the tables have a lot of stuff on them and they get pretty crowded.  I have asked our waiter to please remove all the extra stuff, like candle and drink menu and they are happy to do so.
