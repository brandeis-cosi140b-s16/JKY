Wonderful food and service.  A fantastic experience all-around.  They give you two kinds of salsa as well as sea salt/cilantro and other delicious goodies with which to dip your chips.  The Queso Fundido was amazing as well.  I typically begin my judgment of Mexican restaurants by evaluating their salsa and chips, and this place gets an A++++++.

I had the finest cheese enchiladas money could buy: corn tortillas with Oaxaca  and Chihuahua cheese blend, with Oaxacan red chilese sauce.  This is literally the best Mexican food I've had in my life.  And the best cheese.  You know how much I love cheese?!?!  A LOT.  I want...no, NEED to know where to acquire this cheese.

Their drinks are very strong so be careful--yes, even the chocolate coconut martini thing.
