Mariscos Playa Hermosa, or I like to call MPH, hands down the best authentic Mexican seafood restaurant in the Valley!  I have written couple of reviews on this place and every time I come here, I walk away extremely happy!  It really doesn't get better than this.  They recently remodeled their restaurant, they now have more seating, re-did the bathrooms, and they now include a full bar!  This place is awesome!

Ambiance-

Once you walk into this restaurant you are taken away by the bright colors, vibrant atmosphere and the great smelling food!  You will notice how clean the place is and how friendly the staff is.  This place is a family owned restaurant and the owners are some of the nicest people you'll ever meet.  Jose and Maria are wonderful people and will always welcome you.

Food-

This is what it's all about right?  The food is the main attraction and they have some of the most delicious food I've ever tasted.  I am a huge fan of seafood and this place has some of the best!  I have sampled many dishes here, but what has me always coming back is the fresh oysters, fried fish, ceviche, and their amazing sauces that they make.


Give this place a try if come to Phoenix, cause trust me, this is where all the locals go to eat.  Hands down, one of the best establishments I've been to!
