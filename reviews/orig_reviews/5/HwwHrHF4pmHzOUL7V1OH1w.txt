EXCELLENT FOOD.  went in on a sunday around 11 wife hoping for a burger. Well she ordered a burger but was in awe of all of the good looking food passing us by.
Her burger was great. I ordered the meatloaf breakfast, has to be the best meatloaf dish I have ever had. So we returned again Monday when we were heading home to LA. My wife had the Richardsons combo which had eggs benedict, enchiladas & asparagus. Says it was the best eggs benedict she has had. I ordered the Adovado breakfast, and wow the flavors are incredible.  We even ordered a to-go plate of the Adovado to bring home. Great to see a true hole in the wall who can really hold their own. Great selection of beers on tap too.
Hideaway is right, had trouble finding as no signs anywhere found by menu on window.
