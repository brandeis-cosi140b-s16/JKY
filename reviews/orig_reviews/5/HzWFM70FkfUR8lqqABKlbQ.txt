Don't ask me how I ended up at this restaurant located in one of those annoying fake-downtown retail/dining centers way the fuck out in B.F.E. Well OK, it's because my boyfriend lives out there. Otherwise, I would never have come here.

We went during happy hour, and tried everything on their happy hour menu, all of which was shockingly affordable and shockingly delicious. The house margaritas were excellent, too. The chips and salsa were AMAZING.

The atmo is sort of casual upper-middle-class-suburban Tex-Mex, and they have a patio for outdoor dining, where you can bask in the breeze created by all the SUVs blasting down one of those ginormously expansive asphalt rivers that pass for roads up there.

Overall, it was excellent food at a great price, but I probably would not drive all the way up here to eat here. If they opened a location closer to midtown, then maybe.
