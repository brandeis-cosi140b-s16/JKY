With so many choices for south of the border food it was a pleasant surprise to dine at Taco Haus. The tuna ceviche was exceptionally good and had a unique flavor. Also enjoyed the market.street corn and guacamole dip. We didn't feel rushed and it was pleasant sitting outside.  Service was friendly and prompt. Great dinner which exceeded.our expectations.
