This place is so small they have less than one table.  But it's worth squeezing in. 

In a nutshell, it's the kind of amazing Mexican place that I remember from my youth in California. I never thought I'd find anything like it in the midwest.  After eating at Maize I may never be able to eat at another mexican place in Champaign-Urbana -- they all compare so poorly to this one.  Beware, once you eat here there's no going back!

I have tried the fancier and more exotic fillings on the menu (the pumpkin flower and the mushroom) and the more authentic formats for them (huaraches, taco mexico) and they were all good, but I liked the "standards" even better. If I were you, I'd start with the simplest: tacos pastor with cilantro and onions. Amazing!  Just amazing.
