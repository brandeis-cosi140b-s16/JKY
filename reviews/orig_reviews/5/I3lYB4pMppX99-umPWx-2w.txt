First off, if you are looking for the same michoacan garbage that is all over this city don't bother. This is Cali Mex, through and through. Fresh ingredients, clean flavors. Also, it's not cheap so if you're offended by a $19 plate of solid mexican food, go elsewhere. For some reason people will pay that for just about any other type of food here without thinking about it but when it comes to mexican food, they think it should be cheaper. I completely disagree but if that's your take, go hit Roberto's & eat half warm food out of a Styrofoam carton.

Salsa here is slightly chunky with great fresh flavor. You are not going to find runny "hot sauce" here. We both ordered the combination plates and there was not a single item that we didn't absolutely love. I especially enjoyed the cheese enchilada which almost had a creamy cheesy consistency & husband especially liked the beef tacos with shredded beef which were encased in a perfectly cooked corn shell, not too hard & not too soft. We also had a half-order of the guacamole which again was incredibly fresh tasting & didn't included a bunch of shredded lettuce at the bottom that many restaurants use as filler. 

The service was incredible (shout out to Jason & his manager) and the interior was beautiful with lots of plant life. It gave the impression you were sitting in one of San Diego's great mexican restaurants.

It's completely refreshing to have an alternative to most of the other nuevo mex & michoacan you'll find in this city. We'll definitely be back!!!
