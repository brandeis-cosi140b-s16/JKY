The 3.5 star rating baffles me.  Maybe people aren't ordering the right menu items.  I come to Phoenix about once a year and usually find a way to eat here 2-3 times.  It's simply the best southwest food I have ever had.  This isn't Mexican, this is southwest.  There is a huge difference.  I several times debated making the 300+ mile drive simply to eat the Carne Adovada and then drive home.  It's that good.  Also, the Carne Adovada Benedict is great for breakfast, the orange juice is fresh squeezed.  I am sure there is also a Carne Adovada Flan that is to die for.  If you can get an appetizer with carne adovada, you should try that too.
