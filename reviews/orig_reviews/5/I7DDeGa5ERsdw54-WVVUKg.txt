So i'm not ashamed to say that i had two lunches the day i came here, with braddah's being my second lunch following in-n-out. This was one of my bookmarked places, and of course, with limited time, i had to try it. I must have expanded my stomach from all the vegas buffets, but braddah's was amazing even though i had already eaten a lunch. I wish they had one in nyc! The guy who served us was a gem! his customer service was through the roof, and made it even more enjoyable for us. When we walked in the door, he asked if we were new, and since we were, he gave all five of us a sample of the meats to try! Wow it was hard to choose just one. Now, i was being greedy so i got all the toppings including the grilled veggies and guacamole (which are a little extra), but it was an amazing meal! they had run low on cilantro, and he went to chop us up some fresh cilantro for our bowls/salads. I had also ordered the coconut bark and they cut some up for us as we sat and ate, and we were also given a little extra to try. I work in hospitality, and i wanted to steal him to come work in ny! Awesome service and awesome food. When in the area, i will be coming back!
