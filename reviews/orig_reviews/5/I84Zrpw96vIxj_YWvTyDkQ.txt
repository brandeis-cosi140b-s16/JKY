What can I say ......... I got married at Treasure Island and had our reception at Senor Frogs.  It was fantastic. Th MC Dave gave us the royal treatment and got our whole party dancing and having fun all night with drink contests and conga lines !They had a band and DJ to keep the party going. Our servers Curtis and Tracy kept the drinks flowing and served 25 plus people with no problems.  The food and drinks were great  !
