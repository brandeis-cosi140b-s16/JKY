They have the best tasting mexican food out  here in the west valley by far. I'm originally from San Antonio, Texas so my taste buds scream Tex-Mex when it comes to Mexican food. So being stationed here I could not find anything close to home until I came here. The food is so flavorful and delicious I was amazed. It reminded me so much of home. I always leave satisfied. I enjoy everything about this place from the mom and pop hospitality (owners are so sweet, helpful, and friendly), the cheap prices, and once again the delicious food. 

STOP BY, I PROMISE YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED! :)
