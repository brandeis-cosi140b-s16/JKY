I recommend this place to all my friends visiting Vegas.  Often times the Strip will cripple tourists' funds, so a cheap, delicious place to eat on the strip is ideal.

Get the adobada tacos, they're probably the best I've had.  The guy on weekends can also throw the sauce in the air and catch it in a taco...
