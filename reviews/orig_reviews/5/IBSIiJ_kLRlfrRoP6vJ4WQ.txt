My absolute favorite Mexican restaurant. The food is always incredible and so full of flavor. The drinks are wonderful. And the salsa is spicy! I definitely stay hydrated when I eat here. I'm not super sensitive to spicy food (I love spicy food, actually), so if you're not comfortable with hot food, be very careful about what you order. It's not for the weak! You can't go wrong with this place. I'd give it a million stars if I could.
