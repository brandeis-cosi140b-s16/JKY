What an amazing lunch! 

Had been meaning to try this place out for a while. Came in for a late lunch and fell in love with it immediately! The decor is awesome!! There's a giant tree in the middle of the restaurant. Everything is pink, orange and clear..very aesthetically pleasing. 

The food is even better than the decor! We had the Suzuki roll (created by the head chef Andrew Suzuki), Chili Crab Noodles and Mexican pho. All flavors were multi-dimensional. We will be coming back many times in the future! A new favorite for sure.
