When I first saw the place I wasn't sure what to think. then we went in the people were friendly and welcoming and then we got our food and were blown away. my girlfriend got the shredded beef chimichanga and a couple of Cantina tacos and I got the chicken chimichanga with a cantina taco and everything was superb.  This place at 9:18 p.m. is completely packed. and as we were eating we saw Mesa PD and Fire and Rescue coming in and out obviously a favorite of theirs.  This is a must try you will love it
