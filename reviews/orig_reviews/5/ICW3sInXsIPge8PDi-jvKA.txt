I was here in August 2014, we came here because this place advertised Organic & Non-GMO food.  The menu looked ok back then but did not really describe much about where the food came from and our server was still drunk from the night before.  The waiter had no idea what food was Non-GMO and what was not.

Fast forward to today, 4/21/15, this place is AMAZING.  The menu has been completely redone, the food is Organic and NOn-GMO.  The menu in the front explains where items come from, it clearly shows what is Gluten Free and what is not.

The taste of the food is out of this world and Executive Chef Paco walks around and chats with customers to ensure your experience is what you would expect here.  The Manager also walks around and checks up to ensure everything is good.  A HUGE change from the last visit when all we got was a hung over server who could not remember anything.

You HAVE to give this place a try, why?

Organic, Non-GMO, Gluten Free items, they REALLY care, they are near the strip AND, they are open 24/7.....

You HAVE to try this place, it's Authentic Mexican food, the Executive Chef is from Mexico City and the pride they take as well as the responsibility is unlike any place you will find.  This place is WORTH a visit and is a MUST.
