Great drink, food, and service.

Have been here numerous times and all have been a pleasure. The bartenders are always on top of their game!

I met up with a friend here a few weeks ago, and we were pleasantly suprised to walk in to some great live music.We ate a chronic dinner, and followed our meals with their ridiculously good "Chocolate Chip Pie".  

Blue Adobe has something for everyone. Their tequila selection is the best in the neighborhood, and the barkeeps can whip up a proper margarita!

The pulled pork adobo sandwich is money!!

Always a pleasure coming here.
