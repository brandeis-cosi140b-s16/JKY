I had heard some great recommendations about this restaurant and decided to try it yesterday morning, and everything surpassed my expectations. Ralph, the owner, is always around the restaurant to talk to customers and make sure that everything they've ordered is up to their liking, and the food is phenomenal. Haven't been for lunch or dinner yet, but the breakfast burritos are definitely worth going there for.
