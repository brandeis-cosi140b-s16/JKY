First there was Pepe's Tacos, then there was Tacos El Gordo and now there's this!!  Best part is the restaurant being only a block away from where I live so I don't have to drive all the way up north for damn good tacos.  Located at the former Republic Kitchen & Bar establishment along South Eastern Blvd, this is definitely one of the better looking taco shops out there.  I like how the new occupants kept the same floor plan from the old bar and added few Latin modifications to suit their concept.  Plenty of seats downstairs, upstairs and even outside.  

This place has several stations for certain cuts of meats from which you can order any way you desire: taco, burrito, nachos, fries, bowl, and vampiro.  Salsa bar is also impressive with various sides and 8 different sauces!!  Thirsty? They have a full bar and an extensive list of beer on tap or in a bottle.  Happy hour is from 6-8 p.m. daily with live mariachi on Mondays and DJ spinning on weekends.

I always get tacos with cabeza (head), lengua (tough) and chicharron (skin) anywhere I go so I had to try them out from this place.  The first two were quite tasty and really tender.  As far as the chicharron, they actually add crispy pork rinds which was a first since other taquerias normally just serve the taco with soggy pork skins.  What also got me hyped up is the fact that they have elotes since I no longer have to track down this dude who sells them from a shopping cart!!

Overall, Taco Y Taco is one of the best Mexican joints in the valley.  I would give them six stars if I could.
