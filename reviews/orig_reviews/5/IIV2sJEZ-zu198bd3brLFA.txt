Food is fantastic. Especially for the price. The agua frescas are amazing. I have been twice. The first time I had a taco with the pork. Delicious.  The second time I went, I had a salad with the carne asada. Delicious. The Mexican street corn was fantastic.   I have a feeling no matter what I try there, I am going to like it. The staff is also very friendly.
