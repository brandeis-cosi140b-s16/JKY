The best burger we've had in a long time. Meat is super tasty with the different kinds of meats used. Buttery, carmalized onions are a tasty addition. The 'fry sauce' is delicious ( never heard of before). The Dulce de Leche shake was super creamy and smooth. The Stand is definitely a new fave we will be visiting when we come up to the Phoenix area!
