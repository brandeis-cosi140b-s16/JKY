While the neighborhood has changed significantly over the last thirty years, (not for the better)  La Pinata hasn't changed a bit. The food is still wonderful and the margaritas are too. Their salsa is my favorite in the Valley though I like Carlo's O'Brien's chips better. I don't care how authentic Mexican food is, I want the food of my childhood when I return to Phoenix and La Pinata is it. The spinach queso dip is really good and I always get a machaca chimichanga because theirs are outstanding. Wish I got to Phoenix more often....
