Searching desperately for a Mexican restaurant that stayed open a little later than 9pm on the night of my friend's dad's birthday, we settled on Bonito Michoacan.

What we received was extremely friendly service, a lot of delicious food, and they had like a 4 piece band sing happy birthday and gave our man of the hour a free shot of tequila.

I don't really see anything I could have criticized from our experience. We were seated promptly, treated well, and the food was surprisingly very delicious. Additionally, we stayed there for a good 40 minutes after their closing time and never felt rushed at all.

I had the steak cilantro, whilst the others around the table had an assortment of chimichanga, a crazy gigantic burrito, and chicken helena or something along those lines. Everything was cooked really well with rich strong flavors.

We also got the hand-made table side guacamole and it was extremely tasty and fresh.

All in all it was a very pleasant experience.
