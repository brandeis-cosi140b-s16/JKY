The tacos here were awesome. Being first timers we were offered samples of all the meat options on the menu, which were all really good. The staff was super friendly and helpful when we were figuring out our order since there were so many types of taco fillings to pick from. We loved what we ended up ordering! Can't wait to come back here on our next trip to AZ
