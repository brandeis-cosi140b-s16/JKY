They deserve the 5 stars for making their margaritas with fresh lime juice. This makes the drink superb. Most places use mix and it ruins the margaritas. We also tried their salsas which were really good. They have fresh made chips, also a must for Mexican. They are open until midnight during the week, which makes this a great place to end the night.
