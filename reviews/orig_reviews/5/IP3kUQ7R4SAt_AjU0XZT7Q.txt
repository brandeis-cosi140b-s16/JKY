My husband & I ate here last night during our trip to Pittsburgh.  I had read online about their cheap happy hour.  We did get here an hour early but decided to sit at the bar and order anyway.  It wasn't busy at 4:00 on a Monday (but then it was rainy and windy outside).  Our bartender/server, Jorge, was just wonderful.  He was very personable and recommended items to us both.  I was going to order the fish tacos with tilapia but he said the mahi mahi tacos were better.  Indeed they were.  The homemade chips and queso were also a great starter.  They have great beer on tap and an extensive liquor selection.

 The restaurant is on the second floor and you can look out the windows at Market Square.  We will definitely come back on a return visit!  Another bartender recommended a breakfast place to us and we are on our way there this morning.
