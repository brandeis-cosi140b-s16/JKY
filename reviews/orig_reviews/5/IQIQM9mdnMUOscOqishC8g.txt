Walked into Revo Burrito for the first time in a couple months and I immediately saw my favorite happiest worker Oscar. He immediately made me feel comfortable with chips and water and when my to-go order came he made sure I had absolutely everything I could ever need. As a former employee, I can say that things haven't changed much and that, my friends, is a good thing.
