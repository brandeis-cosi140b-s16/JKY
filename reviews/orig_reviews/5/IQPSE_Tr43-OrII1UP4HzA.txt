What can I say...I LOVE this place! Authentic superb Mexican food!  Sangria is made fresh daily and is HUGE!  And The carnitas michoacan platter....you will think you have died and gone to heaven:). Also they are dog friendly we bring our yorkie here all the time and sit on the patio and the staff is very friendly to our dog.  It's our favorite place!  Check it out!
