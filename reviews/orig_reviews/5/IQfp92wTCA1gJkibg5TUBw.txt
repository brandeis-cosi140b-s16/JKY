Another stellar dinner @ Eldorado. Haven't been here in a while- Staff has changed quite a bit since last time we were here, but we still had great service. Came down for Happy Hour and $2 street tacos. Props to Chef Paco and the crew, as always, for throwing down on some delish eats. And thanks to our bartender, Ashley, for taking care of us! We'll be back!
