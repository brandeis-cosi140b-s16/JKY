I love this place! I have only been for lunch and happy hour, so I can't comment on the dinner menu at all, but for lunch it rocks. Service is always fast and good, food is excellent, happy hour menu rocks with a varied selection of margaritas that are all yummy. The apps are half off at happy hour also, so you can actually have a nice "meal" if you want. The patio is nice and sometimes they have live music. It's kind of hidden in a strip mall, so if you don't know where it is, you could miss it. This is not a typical strip mall place, though, it's very nice inside. Also, check for specials with Yelp- they offer some great deals!
