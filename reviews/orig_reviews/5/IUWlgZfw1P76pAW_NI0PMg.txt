So this place used to be a steak joint, and as a vegetarian, I never really had a reason to pay it any mind. But the Wahoo's has been here for a little while, and let me tell you, I am quite glad it has! 

Does henderson lack a decent Mexican restaurant? No. But trying to find a decently clean late night bar that's not a PT's that also serves some great vegetarian options at a very competitive price can be an exercise in futility. 

$3 pacificos all the time. I got the "Outer Reef" vegetarian burrito, which, for ~$5 was very satisfactory. I'd get it again, but I'd probably ask for less rice and more beans. The view at night is wonderful as well! The addition of outdoor seating and a few couches around a fire really make for a pleasant experience. Would definitely recommend!
