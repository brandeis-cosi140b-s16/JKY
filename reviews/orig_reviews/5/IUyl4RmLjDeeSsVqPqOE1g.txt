Best straight-up sit-down Mexican restaurant in Phoenix!  I've driven over 40 minutes on several occasions just to eat here.

This place is really tiny, but that's because it used to be a residence.  Eventually the business grew so much that the owners moved out and converted their home into a restaurant.

The food is great, and really inexpensive.  Everything I've had is excellent.  The staff is friendly and the service is fast.  It's one of the places I like to take visiting friends and family.
