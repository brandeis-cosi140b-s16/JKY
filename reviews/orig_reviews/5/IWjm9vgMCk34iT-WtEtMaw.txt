Was in Charlotte just a couple of days the week of Jan 27th, and went here twice. Love this place. The guac is one of the best. Went in for lunch, and although crowded, we were still able to get a seat. The place emptied out as thelunch hour came to an end and it quieted down a bit. Had a pork burrito and a shredded beed taco the two different times I was here. Loved them. Highly recommend if your in Charlotte, looking for a quicj mexican restaurant.
