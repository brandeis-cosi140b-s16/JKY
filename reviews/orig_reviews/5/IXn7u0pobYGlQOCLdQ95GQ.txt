So I'm a gringo as they refer to us-  A group of pale skinned honkies whose greatest contribution to the Mexican food culture is taco bell. I wouldn't know "authentic" Mexican food from plain old Mexican food but this place is really good. It's a far cry from the ultrabland shite we call Macayo's. The service was good, and we really enjoyed the food. The beef seemed to be  actual beef which was a really cool treat.  The burrito was huge, the salsa's great and I got a bueno vibe.(see what I did there?)

It's my first review, and yes I'm really like this in real life. You should add me as a friend cause I eat out alot, and I make with the laughing all the time.
