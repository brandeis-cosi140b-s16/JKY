I've had the luxury of going to Tako twice now and I can't say I've ever been disappointed with the service and the food. I had the same server twice and she was very attentive in taking our orders and was patient when we had issues with deciding what to get and made wonderful suggestions for us!

The first time I went I had the Chorizo taco and it was the most flavorful, scrumptious, piece of taco heaven I have ever had. For the second time I had the Pollo Asado. It was a nice slightly charred piece of grilled chicken packed with all of the same other ingredients the chorizo taco had (minus the fried egg). 

For the dessert we had the mint chocolate ganache. WARNING: the ice cream is very minty like the leaf. It's not your standard mint chocolate ice cream kind of deal which in my opinion is awesome. When it mixes with the dark chocolate and the blackberries it creates an odd bland flavor, but once it sits in it becomes somewhat of a masterpiece of flavors.

Also if you're wondering what the little dispenser is in the bathroom. It's a condom dispenser. We asked our waitress after having a 6 person dispute on whether or not it was a condom dispenser, a sticker dispenser, or a giant hoax that kept the customers in a perpetual state of curiosity, forcing people to spend the 4 quarters to find out the mystery. 

Will definitely be coming here again to try out the guacamole and more of the delicious desserts!
