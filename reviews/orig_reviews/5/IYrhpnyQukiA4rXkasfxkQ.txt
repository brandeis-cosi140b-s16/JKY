Let me tell you about my favorite new Mexican restaurant. They serve these amazing three cheese quesadillas that you can inhale in six minutes flat, with a beer, while you are rushing to catch your connecting flight at Phoenix Sky Harbor airport. 

And they also have this amazing free laptop shipping service for the patrons who leave their corporate laptops at the bar. Amazing food and shipping services. Thank you - to the unnamed bartender, Lauren, and Courtney from Blanco Tacos and Tequila.
