My husband actually found this place when he was researching recipes for cooking nopales. They have an amazing dish with nopales, chorizo, and cheese from Chihuahua. We went for lunch and that dish isn't on the lunch menu, but they made it for us anyway. I can't say enough nice things about Asi Es La Vida -- if you're in the neighborhood, you should definitely check it out.

As I said in my check-in:

Best mole ever. Best sangria ever. Love this place!
