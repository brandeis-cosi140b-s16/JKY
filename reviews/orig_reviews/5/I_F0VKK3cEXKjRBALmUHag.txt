GREAT food! I love supporting local family owned businesses in Las Vegas. They've been here for 35 years, which says a lot in this town. They were even in the Guinness book of world records for the largest margarita! 
Being centrally located on Flamingo and Decatur is awesome, and you can't beat being open 24 hours! 
I've got nothing bad to say about this place. It's a must try, that is, if you haven't already.
