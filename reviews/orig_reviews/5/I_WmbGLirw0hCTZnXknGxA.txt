When President Clinton visited town he made a stop at Poncho's Mexican Food.  It struck me as an odd choice at the time, but also made me curious about the food.  Was Clinton just making a political stop or did he actually have some inside intelligence from forward operatives?

After eating at Poncho's, it was obvious that Bill knew a thing or two about Mexican food.  They have wonderful combinations and the restaurant has become a habit for our family.  

PLEASE don't confuse this wonderful independent restaurant with the Pancho's Buffet restaurant.
