Honestly, my family and I eat at Roberto's so often I can't believe that it never occurred to me to write a review until now. We're from Southern California (born and raised) and Roberto's is our go-to place for Mexican food. There is really no other place in Las Vegas that nails it like Roberto's does. It's excellent in every aspect from the quality to the ingredients to the service. This location in particular offers consistency of product and service that should be the model for all of their other locations.

I've eaten at probably every other Roberto's across Las Vegas and I've found every one except the Durango/ D.I. location to be perfect. That location seemed a bit disorganized on my visit and the people weren't of the caliber of the other locations. Not sure why, just my observation.

Whether you want traditional Mexican food on the go or if you want to eat in, you can't go wrong here.
