Richardson's is the best New Mexican food in the Phoenix area.  I'm not sure if that is saying much, because I have only been to one other that specializes in New Mexican cuisine (Carlsbad in Scottsdale).  The use of Green Chili at this restaurant is second to only some of the meals that I have had in the "Q" (Albuquerque for those of you not in the know) and Sante Fe.  I love myself some Green Chili and Richardson's gives me my fix.

It truly was a sad day when I learned that Richardson's had burned.  Luckily for us, the building was salvagable, and the owner publicly let everyone know that it would be back as a staple for Phoenix diners. 

Richardson's menu is currently featured at the Rokerij location down the street if you are needing a fix while they re-build their current location.  The Rokerij is located just north of the Richardson's location at 16th Street and Maryland.  So if you need your fix of New Mexican cuisine or some awesome margarita's, make sure to head a little bit north and enjoy the atmosphere at their additional location!
