I can't say enough about this place. That last two time we have come to Vegas we have gone here for lunch. The location is perfect! We stayed at the Wynn and just had to get away from the swanky atmosphere. I wanted a place where I can sit outside, have a few beers ( or a few too many), watch the game, watch the people, and have some decent food. That is what I found at el Segundo, and that is why I keep coming back.

Atmosphere- casual, Mexican cantina. They have a bar outside on the patio, along with plenty of seating. They have another bar inside with plenty of seating as well. Both bar are equipped with tvs that will allow you to watch the game. They accommodate large groups easily and without any complaints.

Food- the menu is the perfect size. It covers a lot of various foods, but isn't a novel. We had nachos which were huge, and also very good. The tacos were good and the chips and salsa....... Amazing. We have never had a bad experience there. I have recommended this place to a few other people, and everybody enjoys it.

Service- top notch. Our server was always close by , and my beer was never empty for long. Everybody was happy and had great attitudes.
