My wife and I go here frequently 2-3 times a month. Usually on a Saturday or Sunday.  Our experience has always been fantastic as evidenced by the fact that we stay for 3-4 hours each time. We usually sit at the bar. Service is great and very friendly.  Kenna, Joel, Ishmael, Gus and Brian are fantastic. Food is also very good, especially the beef with jalapeño sauce in the rice bowl, the burrito and the Sunday jalapeño sandwich. Tamales are also the best in the area. Ask the wait staff for a selection. They've never steered us wrong. They also have gluten free beer most of the time.
