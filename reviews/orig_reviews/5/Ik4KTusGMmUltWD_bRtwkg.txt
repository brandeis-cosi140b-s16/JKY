Reasonably priced, excellent, fresh food, and excellent, speedy service. What more could you ask for?  I had one of the combo meals (#100), which came with a cheese enchilada, beef tamale, and a beef taco (I substituted a chicken taco), rice, and beans.  All of the food was amazing, but my favorite was the tamale.  The cornmeal/masa was amazing and soft and just delicious.  I highly recommend this place!
