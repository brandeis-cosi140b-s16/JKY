Went to Casa Rasta last Friday and we really enjoyed the food and the prices were very reasonable. The place wasn't very busy and they had Bob Marley playing in the background which was a bonus. The interior style was Mexican meets Caribbean and looked really nice which great Tiffany style lamps, thatched roofs and different Caribbean style pictures everywhere. 

We started out with the Sweet and Spicy Mango wings and those were my favorite. Loved the sauce that came with them and definitely recommend them to anyone. The Shrimp Curry Burrito was our next favorite because the curry taste wasn't extremely strong and added so many great elements to the dish. We also had an assortment of the tacos and all were really good. We especially enjoyed the homemade salsa that we added onto it and nothing was overly hot... at least for me. 

Casa Rasta is currently a BYOB establishment so make sure you go prepared or be satisfied with a regular beverage.
