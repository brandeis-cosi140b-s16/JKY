It didn't disappoint in the slightest, I had the marinated grilled pork and it was delicious. Service was friendly and restaurant was clean (from what I could see). Prices were reasonable.  I've had bigger burritos at other places, but if you prefer quality of quantity this is the place. The burrito I had was enough to fill me up and I didn't leave hungry.
