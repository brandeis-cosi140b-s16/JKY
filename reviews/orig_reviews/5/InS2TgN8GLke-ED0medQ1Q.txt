Excellent service and food! The Head Chef Mr. Mendoza came to our table to ensure that we were well taken care of. Our server Pam was very attentive and super friendly. I had the ahi tuna and Baja style fish taco a la carte...both were so delicious. My husband had the Chile Colorado and talk about tasty! It was full of flavor and real authentic Mexican. I also had a margarita and that was really good as well! I will definitely come back to Pink Taco.
