This is no Baja Fresh. This is a place for real foodies looking to get away from normal day to day "Mexican". Good location in container park, clean, and great menu selection. Homemade tortillas. I would recommend the lengua tacos. Decent prices, and a good vibe.  
Owner comes around and asks how everything is going. I wish that more restaurants would take notes.
