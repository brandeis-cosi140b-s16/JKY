Last Time i visited this place i dropped in my business card (finally a good use for them lol) and with in that next week i got a coupon in the mail for a free meal! HEYA!!! I have been itching to use it for days!! 

The best part is that it is only a block or so away from my school, class gets out right before 9... and it closes at 10... just enough time... 
math makes me crave Mexican, i cant help myself.... 

last night i had the shredded beef burrito with cheese and sour cream inside... and beans on the side... i was in heaven!!! 
Their beef is soooo goooodddd!!!! 

i think they are starting to recognize us.. lol 

Mmm I'm In love with this place!!
