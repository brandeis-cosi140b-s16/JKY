This is one of my all-time favorite places to eat in Phoenix Metro.  The atmosphere is casual, the crowd diverse, and the food is cheap, good and one-of-a-kind.

Try their Monday night special (a pumpkin sauce?!).  If you don't want chicken, get the sauce on the Clare Enchilada (my favorite), mmm mmm.
