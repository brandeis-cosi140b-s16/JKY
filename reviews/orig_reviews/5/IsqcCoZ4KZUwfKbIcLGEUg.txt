How can one restaurant continue to be the best that Phoenix has to offer for over 25 years? Visit La Hacienda at the Princess Resort to find out! A remarkable restaurant with "over the top" entrees and southwestern unique presentations. 

Service was a bit spotty due to volume of diners, but even that shouldn't discourage  a visit. This is my first visit to the restaurant in almost 7 years. It was always considered my favorite restaurant in all of Phoenix/Scottsdale. Shame on me for waiting so long to return. If visiting the valley, or just out for a special evening, it is a "must" to truly experience the very best we have to offer in Southwestern cuisine.
