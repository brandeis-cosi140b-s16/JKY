I went to lunch on a Monday with a coworker after a good friend gave it rave reviews and told me locals get 50% off on Mondays. It was easy to find because I can read signs. Pull into the parking lot, walk toward the building and enter through the door with the restaurant's name on it-- not hard, people.

The decor reminds me of a cabaret look which was fun. The wall covering is really pretty. It's dimly lit but not so dark that you can't see.

The chips and salsa were great. I ordered the 3 taco plate and chose al pastor and carne Asada. I loved both, but I think the al pastor was my favorite. The refried beans were spot on. I rarely eat more than 2 bites of refried beans at most places, but I finished them here. The rice was heaven. I'm not sure if I want to know how much butter they used, but the flavor was delightful! My coworker enjoyed his carnitas and al pastor taco plate as well.

The staff is very helpful and the chef made his rounds while we were there. The only thing I'd suggest to make it perfect is for the staff to just be careful to not be overly present. We were visited by 6 people including waiters, water person, 2 management types and chef during our visit. Attentiveness is great, but sometimes you want fewer interruptions when dining. 

We'll be back for lunch with other office mates soon and also for dinner so we can try the bar's offerings!
