My husband and I made one of our frequent trips to PVPC tonight and to our delight it was their 1 year anniversary. Yay! A phenomenal local business made it a year and I know it is because of their scrumptious food, super friendly service, and good value.

It's been almost a year since we first visited PVBC and we did expand our horizons a bit. It is so hard to order something new because what you had before was so delicious, you want to order it again! But now I am a fan of their breakfast club, which is a protein packed vegetarian delight. Fluffy eggs, cheese, freshly sliced and fried potato chips, avocado, and mayo all on the recommended whole grain bread. Don't be fooled by the word "breakfast" in this item because this makes the perfect dinner. I have also tried different varieties of their portabella burger. Their gravy is vegetarian and freshly made by the owner... a wonderful addition to a bella burger! They have other great veggie options available... just haven't gotten around to ordering them yet.

Fries are still amazing, french toast fries are decadent.

My carnivore husband obsesses over their weekly burger specials, which they advertise on Facebook. One time we had a burger (me with a bella replacement) with roasted broccoli, carmelized onions, horseradish sauce, and sharp cheddar. Good Lord. Tonight my husband had a burger with apples, cheddar, bacon, and pecan aoli. Really? Their creativity and quality is worth a visit from Guy Fieri. 

The owner is wonderful. He is so nice and dedicated to his business that my husband can't hate him even though he is a fan of NY sports. ;)

Next time you want a good burger... or sandwich, taco, salad, etc... don't go to the drive thru, Red Robin, or even the trendy $15 hamburger place. Try PVBC.
