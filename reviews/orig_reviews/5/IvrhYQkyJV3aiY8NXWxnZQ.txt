Gallo Blanco is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants, so after finding out that the owner opened a new spot I definitely wanted to give Otro a try.

My husband and I came in for lunch. We were immediately served chips and two kinds of salsa; spicy red and a mild green. I only had a small taste of the red because I'm a wimp, it had quite a kick. The green was very fresh tasting and really good. I decided on the chicken noodle soup, shared guacamole, and my husband had the torta. 

The chicken noodle soup was like a Mexican version of Pho. It was a big bowl of chicken broth with a generous amount of rice noodles and chunks of chicken. Fresh mint, basil, cilantro, bean sprouts and lime were served on the side. The broth combined with the fresh ingredients made for a very good meal. 

The guacamole was very fresh, similar to Gallo Blanco with hints of citrus in it, it tasted great. 

I only had a bite of my husbands torta, but the flavor was fantastic! The rice on the side was much different and had lots of fresh vegetables like squash and kale.

Oh and they serve passion fruit iced tea, which I love!

Service was very good too, they explained the menu and also warned me about how spicy the sauce for my soup was before dumping it into my whole bowl. I like being able to adjust the spice in my meals because I'm such a wimp when it comes to spice. I will definitely return to Otro Cafe.
