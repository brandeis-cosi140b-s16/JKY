Some of the best, authentic Mexican I have had outside Mexico. The Sopes were fantastic. I tried them with carne asada and pastor, both were quite tasty.

The horchata was also on point. The chile relleno was probably the best I've had in recent memory. I can't think of a better one I've had that wasn't home cooked.
