Remarkable!  I had the huevos rancheros and the underlying tortilla was soft and fresh. Two salsas, of course, both with clear tomato flavors present. The coffee has what I thought was a touch of Mexican chocolate but it turns out was a hint of cinnamon added. Delicious!  The beans were light colored and flavorful as was the rice.  I am a vegetarian and the options on the menu were extensive for folks like me.  If we come back to Phoenix we will definitely, definitely eat here again.
