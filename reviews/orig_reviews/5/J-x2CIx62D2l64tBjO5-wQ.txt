5 STARS! A place so good the only bad thing is the $50+ per person check that comes afterwards. Luckily, I got it all free. While waiting for a table we got a top quality Cazadores Reposadas (sp?) tequila on the rocks. It was really strong, and really high-quality. In fact - i've never tasted a tequila like it. Other than Chili's presidente margarita I've never had a higher quality one.

For appetizor we got the Seafood Maya Relleno - a melted cheese and seafood dish which had real ceviche, rock shrimp, and amazing scallops with some sort of cheddary, spicy cheese on top melted to perfection. 5/5 delicious!!

For the entrees I ordered the grilled adobo marinated mango salmon over pollento. The salmon was so tender and juicy it melted in my mouth. I was eating tiny little chunks just to savor it all. The pollenta and the sauce it came with was amazing as well 5/5.

My friend got the chicken enchiladas (I tried to tell her to try something unique like my dish [a top entree], but she insisted on her fav enchiladas, and they were very good - though just enchiladas 4/5. I wish she had gotten something else off the entree menu so that I could try some ha.

For dessert we shared one of the better flans I've ever tasted. The caramel glaze and design of it were extraordinary. 5/5 Flan!

Washing it down with a reposada refill made it all the better.

A true culinary experience. $120 total bill post tip. Thankfully it was my early bday gift!
