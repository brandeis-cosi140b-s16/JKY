Nothing fancy here, but very well executed quick service Mexican food.  I've been told by numerous people that ATS has the best carne asada in the Valley, and I must say that the carne asada burrito did not disappoint.  Very flavorful beef, wonderful spices, fresh pico de gallo, and a warm soft tortilla.  This is very hard to beat in terms of quality and price.
