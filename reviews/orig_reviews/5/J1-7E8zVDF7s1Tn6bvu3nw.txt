I am totally in love with this place! It is soooo good. I usually just get a shredded beef chimi, with red sauce and it is very good. 

besides that, I HATE leftovers, but whenever I bring home leftovers from si senior, i always eat it. Their food is still good the second day. 

They also have sopapillas- either regular or cinnamon.  and free chips, with 4 different kinds of dips. I am not a big dip person, but when I took my dad here he loved it! 

The service is also good. :)
