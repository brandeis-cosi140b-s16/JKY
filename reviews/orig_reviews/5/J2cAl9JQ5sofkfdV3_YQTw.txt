I'm a regular at this Blanco, and I have to say that the service is what keeps me coming back! The food is great too but if you ever have an issue with anything they are willing to go above and beyond for you with out you even asking for it. I remeber one time a group of friends and I went in to grab some food before going out on a sat night and at some point the server asked us if he could get us anything and we jokingly mentioned a candy bar. As we were ready to close out and our bill arrived, the server pulled out the candy that was jokingly requested! Now that's service! Stop in when you get a chance you won't regret it.
