This place was GREAT! I'm not much of a drinker, but I did have one of their well known margaritas and I was NOT disappointed at all. It was a bit pricey for a Mexican restaurant, but it is also considered "upscale" whatever that means... this is Vegas we're talking about. I've been there a few times and the fajitas (beef or chicken) are a force to be reckoned with. The seasoning they use on the meat is very unique. The beef almost has a sweet flavor to it that I believe, though I can't be certain, is orange flavored. It's nothing you'd expect, but definitely something you'll enjoy! They also have an array of deserts if that is your cup o' tea, but the best way to spend your time and money while in La Isla is on the actual meal. Enjoy friends!
