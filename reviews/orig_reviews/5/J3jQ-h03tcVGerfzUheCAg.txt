Unreal.  Awesome.  I had the Enchilada plate green beef.  Soooo good.  And the atmosphere was nice with eclectic Mexican art and surroundings.  Everyone in our party of 7 enjoyed their food including the Carne Adovada ribs, Carnitas, and the New Mexico stew.  I was especially impressed with the rice and beans; multiple flavors popped with every bite!  Highly recommended.
