I've been here several times, it is consistently great. No wait at 6:00, had a BBQ something taco and a Wahoo taco, with the jalapeno cheese mashers. Food was excellent yet again. Highly recommend it. There is a donkey on the ceiling trim in the corner or the men's bathroom.. random I know but just saying.
