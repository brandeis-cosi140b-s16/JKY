Update: I went back here a few days later because I love fish tacos. I can confidently conclude,  after two visits, this place is great for more than just the tacos. The employees are so personable.  I got this vibe the first time I went as the customers and staff exchanged friendly banter while the staff diligently executed their taco making duties. But it wasn't just a fluke; the people that work here are awesome. It is definitely a business I want to support. They in exchange can support my frequent appetite for fish tacos. I may even go so far as to explore other menu options and diverse my taco experience.
