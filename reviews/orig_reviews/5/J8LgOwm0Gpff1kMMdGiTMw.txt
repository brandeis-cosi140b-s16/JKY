I love chipotle, but when i ate at this place i could say its way better than chipotle, the Barbacoa Salad is dying for.. Now Ive been going back here since my friend introduced me to this place. Very neat , Clean and good service.. most of all its cheap and its good... I recommend this restaurant !!!!!
