Easily the best, most authentic Mexican food in Phoenix. Take it from an L.A. guy who had almost forgotten what good Mexican food tasted like since I moved away. I almost teared up with joy when I ate here. I have brought over 20 people here since my first visit, and they are all loyalists now. Do yourself a favor and check it out.
