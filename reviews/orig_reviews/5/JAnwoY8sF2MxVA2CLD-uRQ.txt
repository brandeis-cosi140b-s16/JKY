The owner and employees are super friendly.

The food is always fresh and made to order. Their homemade salsa is great.

They aim to be known as "Home of the Fish Taco," but their potato taco really gives them a unique and unbelievably delicious edge.

Their biggest weakness is their marketing, because if the rest of Las Vegas really knew how great they were, this restaurant would be packed all day, everyday.

They are very cheap and the beers beat any bar's happy hour out there.
