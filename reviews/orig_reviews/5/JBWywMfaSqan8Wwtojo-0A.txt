We had a wonderful lunch at Los Dos Molinos. 

My spouse enjoyed the prickly pear margarita.   

The green salsa was splendidly fiery.  The red salsa was a heartier version with less heat than the green salsa but more than most restaurants provide.

We both had the carne adovada and it was spectacular. 

The sopapillas were enjoyable.

Service was friendly and efficient.

The food at the Camelback location was every bit as good as the one on Central south of Baseline.  

We will definitely be stopping by this location again.
