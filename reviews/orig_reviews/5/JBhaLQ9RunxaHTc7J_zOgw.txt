Every single time I try another Pittsburgh not-so-authentic Mexican place,  I just end up comparing it to Mad Mex Shadyside.  Thank you for being my gold standard all these years. I've been here 100 times and have only had one or two dishes I didn't care for, and I've never had a bad drink.  The atmosphere and layout are great, the prices are fair, food is good and consistent, and 9/10 times I get a really fun server.
