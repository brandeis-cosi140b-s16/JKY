This is my "go-to" Mexican food place in the valley.  The chips are plentiful, fresh, and light - the salsa is chunky, not to spicy (but you can order hotter). Service is fast. Parking at lunch hour is difficult - but outside of the lunch hour no problem. They have been here forever. It's a family run business. Favorite dish... cheese enchilada w/ the GREEN sauce most definitely, second - try steak picada - a not to miss dish. They will make the chees crisps extra crispy upon request, which is great - and have fresh tea and great beer.  It's a simple no fuss Mexican food place.  Low cost too.  Love that they don't try to "fancy up" the dishes - just nice simple home style cooking - what we all want sometimes.
