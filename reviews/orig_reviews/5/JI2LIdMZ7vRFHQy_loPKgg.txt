I Love Carolina's ! Great Mexican food!

Yummy all the way. Thanks to the power of Yelp, I did this place instead of some chain restaurant near downtown. I was kinda nervous in the ghetto neighborhood it was it but well worth it.   What a great discovery. Its hard to get all the basics exactly right but  Carolina's has delicious beans, rice, tortillas, and the Carne asada tacos are bomb!!. The service was quick and very pleasant. It's a counter order service and then they call out your name like a Starbucks but its yummy Mexican food. 

Its fast enough for lunch if you work downtown and have a 30 min lunch break. Call it in and have a coworker pick it up. 602-252-1503
