The family and I came here today.  I ordered the guacamole boyger with the chencho skinny fries.  My brother ordered the the pastrami boyger and also the same fries.  We asked for the burgers to be cut in half because we wanted to share and I'm glad we did.  Both boygers were awesome!  Fries were great! Will be back for sure.  We were a party of 8 and they accommodated all of us in there perfectly.  Great customer service.
