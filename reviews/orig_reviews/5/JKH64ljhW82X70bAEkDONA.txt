I've been going to Los Olivos Patio since the dawn of time. This family has been in the neighborhood since the early 1960's. I've always enjoyed the Margaritas and the Quesedillas. The food is authentic and tastes as good as it reads on the menu. Anytime family members come into town for visits or vacations they always ask to go to Los Olivos. Enough said. This restaurant is amazing.
