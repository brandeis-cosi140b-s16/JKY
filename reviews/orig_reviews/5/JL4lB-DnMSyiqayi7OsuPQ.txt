I have been to this place at least a half a dozen times & I absolutely love it! It doesn't look like much from the outside, but as soon as you walk in you are pleasantly surprised with their outside patio and water features! They have an excellent happy hour as well. I was brave and tried the Habanero cheeseburger one night & it was fierce! It was delicious going down, but I regretted it the next day! Haha... I also love the Cavern Chicken Salad & the Lobster Enchiladas! Yum yum!
