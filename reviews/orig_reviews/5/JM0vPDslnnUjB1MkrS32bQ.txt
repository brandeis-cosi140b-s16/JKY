This is an awesome mexican restaurant. The food was wonderful and the staff went out of their way to give us a memorable experience. We had reservations , and the table was not vacating. We waited 20 min. The staff set up a delightful table for 7 people outside,they brought in heaters and lit the Fire pit. Lovely atmosphere for making us wait. The staff, brought us delicious apps. And after our meal they brought desserts. Very kind of our waiter Connor, who took good care of us. Thanks Connor for a great night.
