Sooooo GOOD! Mahi Maji tacos were flavorful with an abundance of tender meat and fresh veggies. The mango salsa was perfect. My friend loved her Tilapia tacos and calamari fries. Sauces and salsas were all very tasty. We came in close to closing but the waiter was still friendly and helpful. I'll definitely be back!
