Gave this place a try a few days ago and I gotta' say, WOW.Upon entering,I was greeted by the manager and an associate immediately.I was having a hard time deciding what to order for dinner so the manager gave me samples of all the meats.Their chile rojo is one of the best I have ever had.Reminded me of my mom's cooking as a kid.I loved it.I ordered the 4 tacos for $5.99 and decided to get two of em' with the chili rojo and the other two with chicken.Their chicken was truly one of a kind.My gf ordered a burrito for $5.99 and it was so huge and tasted soo good too.I am definitely goin' back there soon.The service and food was great.A++
