!st time visit as an out of towner from the STL area where we have a plethora of authentic Mexican family run restaurants. I had the lengua, al pastor and chicharrones tacos. The lengua was a tender as I've ever had. Barbacoa was delicious. The star was the chicharrone taco was the best taco I ever ate.  Crunchy yet chewy...WOW is all I can say. Perfect amount of heat made it spot on. Nicely done!!
