Went to Macayo's with my girlfriends to get a drink on a Thursday night and It was awesome! they had live music and the drinks were great. The bartender Joey was great. He served everyone right away when you approach the bar. No one is ever dry on drinks. We asked for some SHOTS and he made us these unbelievable Sweet tarts they were awesome!!
Thank you Joey. Will DEFINTELY  go again! HAPPY HOUR!!
