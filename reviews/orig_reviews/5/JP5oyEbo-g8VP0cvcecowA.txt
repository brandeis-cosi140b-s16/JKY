This place was really good. 

The food was fresh and lots of choices. I really liked food. Everything I tasted was excellent and everything I saw others eating looked amazing. I am very excited to go back and try some more food. The presentation of the food was simple and creative.

The dining room is laid out slightly awkwardly but furnished beautifully.  

Sidebar:
The female bartender liked to ignore me but I didn't hold it against the restaurant or her. As I know this is not unusual. I eat out alone a lot and as a rule of thumb this is common, female bartenders tend to ignore single female diners/drinkers. Single female diners tend to = lower tips and require more service. This only thing worse is a large group of female only customers or foreigners.  

When I say ignore I mean I had flag her down for a menu, for a drink, for the chips everyone else got when they sat down, for my check, to pick up my check, ect. but it was ok because the food was really really good. 

Sorry for the sidebar but back to the point. 

The food here was excellent. Should have gone sooner and will be back.
