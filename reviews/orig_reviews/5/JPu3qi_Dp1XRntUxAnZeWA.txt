My sons 30th birthday party dinner at El Segundo Sol was Excellent!!  
The event planner Natalie that  coordinated the party was professional, well organized and on top of all of our needs.  The servers, Taylor and Alfonso and the rest of the El Segundo Sol team that took care of us didn't miss a beat!   We had our party in the El Medio room which was great for our loud group of 30 Aunts, Uncles and Cousins.  Our group menu  included a great beverage package (beer, white and red sangria, house margaritas, and non-alcoholic beverages) and a great Fajita dinner package (awesome starters, home made guacamole, chips, salsa, Padrone peppers and coarse salt , great tasting chipotle salad, delicious chicken and beef fajitas with all the trimmings, rice, beans, onions, tomatoes, etc., and a combo desert of flan and double layer fudge cake which was to die for).  Thank you El Segundo Sol!!  You made my sons 30th Birthday an exception dinning experience.  We would highly recommend dinning at  El Segundo Sol if you are in Las Vegas!
Thanks again El Segundo Sol Team, Vince.
