My husband and I drove out to Glendale to wander the shops and discovered that many of them are closed on Sunday. Oh well, we were hungry so made that our priority! We got out our phones and decided to check Yelp reviews for a good Mexican restaurant. La Santisima Gourmet Tacos popped up:)

We were welcomed immediately when we entered and received outstanding service. The restaurant has a cool vibe with colorfully striped chairs and large, vibrant paintings of Frida, Diego, images of Dia de Los Muertos and other iconic images. 

A lot of Mexican restaurants have salsa bars, but not with this many freshly made salsas and in such flavorful varieties. We had to stop ourselves from eating chips so we would have room for our lunch! I tried the combination plate of three street tacos with rice and beans. All were fantastic, but the spicy pork was my favorite! My husband had a quesadilla that he raved about. And he grew up in AZ, so he is picky about Mexican food! We'll definitely return...with friends:)
