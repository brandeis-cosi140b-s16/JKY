While killing some time in between shows on that side of the strip we stumbled up this Mexican gem! Had a seat at the bar to people watch and enjoyed frozen margaritas. Our bartender Oscar was great and fun. We also had guacamole with chips. I love that they have a cart come around to make it fresh in front of you! It also allows for you to customize what you want in the guacamole. It also comes with this fresh mild salsa that was delicious. Menu looked like it had a lot of options, would check it out another time for lunch. The food smelled amazing!
