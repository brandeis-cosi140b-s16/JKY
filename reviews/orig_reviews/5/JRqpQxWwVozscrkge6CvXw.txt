We went here on a recommendation from the cashier at one of the store and we were pleasantly surprised!!    On a Monday night the place was packed!   That can't be a bad thing I thought, right? 

I had a chili releno and it was one of the best I've ever had.     Every item our group ordered was great.   The beans and rice were perfect.  

The salsa was very fresh and hot.   Little bit to much for me but I'm wimpy.  

Prices are very reasonable.    Good portions for prices.

If you want good food I'd totally recommend going here.   If I'm back in Scottsdale I'm definitely going back!!
