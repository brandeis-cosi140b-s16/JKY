After getting blown off by Lola Tapas, my birthday party of 6 came here. (This was on my list but had wanted to try Lola, so glad I came here!! Lola will be another story!) Anyways, so didn`t have a reservation, arrived at 8:20pm, told the manager we were celebrating my birthday(my friends were crammed behind me with armfuls of gifts!) and he said he would do his best to get us in under an hour. 
     So we all tried their sangria, OMG!!! Can I say wow? Sangria with red wine, fused with jack daniels and mango on the bottom! I loved it!!!During the wait, enjoyed the atmosphere of live music, artwork, and watching the delicious dishes come out. We got our table, and started out with their tableside made guacamole. More high marks!! This had pomegranite seeds mixed in, I was in heaven!1 So was my group! Our entrees arrived and I had a chicken-crab torta with avocado pico dressing and mole on the side. It was fabulous!! We were all very happy with our food, and they brought me a birthday flan! I felt very taken care of here with the service! I will definitely be back! Thank you Barrio!!
