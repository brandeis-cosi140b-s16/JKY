Words can not explain the delectable scrumptious  mouth watering tacos this place has. Thank god for Tacos El Gordo on the Vegas strip! I'm a New Yorker and I didn't have a car during my stay in Vegas but man oh man was I glad I yelped this gem! 

Please head my advice, GO THERE! it's totally worth the walk!
