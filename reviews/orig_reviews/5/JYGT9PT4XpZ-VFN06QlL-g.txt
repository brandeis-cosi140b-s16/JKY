Well, this has just become my phavorite place for tacos. I live in Henderson and I drive here for the cuisine. Frank is the one who takes your order, and sometimes brings it out to you. I love that. He is friendly and the place is inviting. He isn't a musician, but he loves music. His shop reflects his passion.  

I ordered every taco on the menu to try. The best one is the adobada taco. A close second is the barbacoa. The meat is good quality but it's the simplicity of the taco that I love. Cilantro and some cabbage. Nice touch. 

Props to Phabulous Phat Phrank and his great taco shop. I would recommend this place to anyone that would like to have their mind blown while eating some good phreaking tacos.

Note+++++
Phrank's hours of operation are limited. It's basically lunch and bkfast only. Call before you show up to check if they're open.
