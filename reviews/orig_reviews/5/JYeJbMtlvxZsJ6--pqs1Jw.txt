This is the most legit New Mexican food place I've found in the Valley. Los Dos Molinos is more popular, but Si Se√±or's dishes are more traditional New Mex style. Their chile is great. If it doesn't make your face sweat, your nose run, and your eyes water, it's not good chile. I never leave this place disappointed with the heat and flavor of the green and red chile they use. Service is always pretty bad and slow, but it's worth it.
