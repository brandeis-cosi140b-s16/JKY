We've been coming here since they opened, and love it! Better than the family "chains" here. We like to sit at the bar during Happy Hour and get a few items from the HH Menu. Bartender is friendly and helpful. When we get a meal...always request the cheese rice. You'll never want regular Spanish rice again. Also, the Queso Tacos...best ever! Now I kind ownership what we need for dinner tonight.
