I eat at Blue Adobe every couple of weeks or so and have enjoyed (at different times) the salmon tacos, the shrimp rellenos, the hatch meatloaf (with a unique potato thing drenched in spices), the carne pork chunks, and of course the stacked enchiladas (I asked for both the red and green sauces on them last night).  The portions are filling here...  It's sort of a quiet bar atmosphere serving---not Senoran or Mexico City style food---but various proteins doused with quality ingredients and a kick.  I couldn't tell you if this stuff really originates in New Mexico...
