My husband and two small girls came here for breakfast today. Two words: ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS! 

The girls shared a full stack of pancakes with buttermilk syrup. The buttermilk syrup alone is enough to come back time and time again. My husband who isn't really a "pancake person" took one taste and said that this is one of the best breakfast restaurants in town! Also my very picky 5 year old raved about the pancakes and asked if we can always come here for breakfast! 

I had the chilaquiles, which were delicious! My husband had a breakfast burrito with bacon, and he ate every bite! Whenever family is in town we plan to bring them here to eat. We will definitely be back to try the french toast and many other menu items! The coffee is delicious and perfect- not too strong and not too weak. 

Adam was our server. He was wonderful! Very helpful and attentive! 

Thank you Rancho De Tia Rosa for a perfect family meal!
