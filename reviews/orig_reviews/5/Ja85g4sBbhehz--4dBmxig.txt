Literally can't visit vegas without eating here AT LEAST once. Seriously wish they had more of these restaurants. Ate here last night for like the tenth time and got our food within 8 minutes and couldn't stop eating it was so bomb. Gotta try their ultimate quesedilla nachos are ridiculous, jalepeno tacos. In love
