Some of the best Mexican food I've ever had. Went with the tacos al pastor, but also split some appetizers and desserts - got a quesadilla then fried ice cream, churros and flan. Everything was exceptional (including the chips and salsa), and the guac was made fresh at our table. Friendly staff, comfortable environment, and amazing food; doesn't get much better than that. Would go again, no question. Easiest 5-stars you could ever give.
