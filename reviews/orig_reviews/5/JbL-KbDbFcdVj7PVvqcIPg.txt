Love this place! Food is great! The owner is really nice! The restaurant is clean! 

Our first time at this restaurant. We were undecided on what to get. So I yelped some pictures. I was not disappointed at all! Had the Tacos (1 beef, 1 chicken, and 1 pork) I didnt know which one I liked the most.
The kids had musubi. My daughter can eat 2 normal sized Musubis but these were a whole nother caliber. For $4 you get 2 pieces but they were huge and my daughter couldnt finish the second piece. 
Also the Bulgogi Nachos were really good. We had a half order because they give you complimentary chips and salsa ... didnt want to over do it. Definitely a must try place... support your local ma&pa businesses!
