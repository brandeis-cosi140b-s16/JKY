My husband and I went here twice because it was soo close to our hotel and it was so cheap.  The first time, we shared an order of carne asada fries for $10.  I had no idea what to expect, but it sounded interesting.  It turned out to be exactly what it sounded like.... french fries covered in grated cheese, guacamole and carne asada.  They were good but not really what I was looking for in terms of spice.

The second time we got the spicy pork tacos.  The pineapple on top was a nice touch.  They had great flavor and spice.  My husband got flour tortillas and I got corn.  We also learned to ask for peppers and onions on the side, which were free.  The people were friendly and helpful.
