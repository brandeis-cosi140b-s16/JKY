I moved to Arizona 3 years ago after living in California near the Mexico border my entire life. It's been very difficult to find a good Mexican place similar to what I'm used to. This is the closest I've found. The breakfast is great, as is the menudo. I really enjoy the "flautas", although they are more like taquitos. The staff is always great and you can't beat the prices. I highly recommend this place.
