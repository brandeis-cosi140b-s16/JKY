If your looking for delicious food, this is definitely the place to go. I got the dinner combo and chose the green burro and the cheese enchilada and my fianc√© got the ranchero burro. Both meals were so yummy and the portions were nice and big. We also got mango margaritas to drink and they did not skimp on the tequila. All in all we will definitely be back.
