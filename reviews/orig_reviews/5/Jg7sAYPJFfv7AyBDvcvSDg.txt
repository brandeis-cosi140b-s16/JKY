Eleven years ago, I moved to Vegas from Las Cruces, NM. Aside from my good friends, the thing I miss the most about New Mexico is the food. There is nothing quite like New Mexican food. Then a friend of mine who moved here from Cruces shortly before I did told me about Carlito's. Of course I had to check it out. 

I must say that Carlito's does a fabulous job of bringing a little slice of home (New Mexico) to Vegas. Everything that I've tried I've enjoyed, but I'm a die hard enchiladas fan. And I eat them like a New Mexican - stacked and with sour cream. The sopapillas are always hot & always delicious. One day I will have to check out the margaritas and report back on them as well. 

If you like to cook with chiles, I would suggest getting on their mailing list or liking them on Facebook so that you are in the loop for when the Hatch chiles will be arriving.
