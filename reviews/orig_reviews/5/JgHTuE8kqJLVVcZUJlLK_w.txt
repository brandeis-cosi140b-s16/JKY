Uh, YUM. This place is small and out of the way. I've driven by it a million times and never thought to stop until our friends told us we should go with them to get some burgers. 

The first thing I noticed was how clean and modern the inside was. It was nice and cozy. We ordered burgers and fries and a short rib taco with a chocolate shake. The shake was so thick and delicious. The fries are seasoned perfectly and the burger was fantastic. You definitely have to get a cheeseburger...the cheese and special sauce make it. It comes with two thinner patties and I actually like that a lot. Sometimes when the patties are too big it makes for messy eats. I didn't get a bite of the taco since boyfriend ate it but he and our friends who have eaten there before said it was awesome.

The staff is fun and pleasant so we will definitely going back here again!
