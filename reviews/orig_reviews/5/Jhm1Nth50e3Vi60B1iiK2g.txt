My father and I stopped in for a quick dinner and we were very satisfied with this place. Complementary chips and salsa if you dine in is a nice touch and you have your choice of three salsas, all of which are great. I had a braised brisket taco with green chiles and the pastor taco, both were delicious. My dad had the steak carne asada burrito, the meat was tender and flavorful and the burrito didn't fall apart. 

I will definitely be coming back to try the rest of the menu, definitely recommend!!
