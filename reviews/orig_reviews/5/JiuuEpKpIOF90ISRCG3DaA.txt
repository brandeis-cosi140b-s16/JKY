Frank and Lupe's is one of my new favorites in Old Town Scottsdale.

I highly recommend it...  They are open until ten every evening and have the best staff. I can't remember a place that had a more attentive group of people.   There are so many places to sit.. very intimate dining areas, a patio and at least three bars...   It's family owned and it shows that they are proud of their business.   Well worth the trip to Scottsdale Arizona... you will not regret it...This place is just great!
