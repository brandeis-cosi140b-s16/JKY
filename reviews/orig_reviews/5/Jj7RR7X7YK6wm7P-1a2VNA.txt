At last wonderful Mexican food in Arizona... you would have thought that would be easy to find. A friend recommended this place and we were not disappointed in the least, The Chicken Mole was wonderful best I've had in years just a hint sweet and not flame thrower spicy. Loved the hot salsa provided which was really not very hot at all but had the great grilled tomato and pepper flavor. Also of note was the flan... our waiter was surprised we wanted dessert! of course. It was just right not thin but fully bodied with real camel flavor and density. We will be back... oh yes it was also a lot of fun to watch the turtles try to climb onto the rock ledges for the sun shine. Highly recommend.
