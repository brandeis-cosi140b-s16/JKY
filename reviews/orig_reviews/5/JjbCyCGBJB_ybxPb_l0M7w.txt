Service was great so friendly. Food was awesome. Saw it on tv and was thrilled to finally make it. Street tacos with a variety of ingredients. So fresh tasting. We had their tacos of the day for $1.99 each. Chicken and pork with cojeta cheese with pico de gallo. Inhaled them. Saw the nachos and they looked great. Was told they were great. Perfect for sharing
