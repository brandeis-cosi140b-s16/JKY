This is by far the best place to eat tacos! They are delicious and by far the best in America. We drove all the way from Washington State to try these tacos- NO JOKE (and also visit Vegas) 
This was the highlight of my trip, and I hope to visit again very soon. Oh and the Tacos de lengua were totally out of this world- AMAZING!
