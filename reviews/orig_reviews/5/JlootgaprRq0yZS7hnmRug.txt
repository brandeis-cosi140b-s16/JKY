I didn't really want to write this review because I like to think that Gallo is my little secret restaurant - and while I would like it to stay that way, I also want them to be successful. 

I think Gallo might be my favorite restaurant.  The hubs and I go all the time, take our out of town friends, family, etc. We (and no one that we have taken) have never been disappointed. Our Tucsonan friends ask to go every time they are in town (and heaven knows that Tucson isn't lacking in the fantastic Mexican fare). 

I am a vegetarian, and while I am predisposed to love a Mexican place that has vegetarian options, Gallo truly earns my love. 

The house salad is AMAZING. Perfect. It is so good, I could eat one every day. They must put crack in the dressing or something. The beans are good, fries are good, stir fried veggies are amazing. Everything I have tried is good. My husband (a non-vegetarian) has tried almost everything on the menu, and hasn't spoken an ill word about any of it. 

Here is where I admit that I am a hypocrite: I tried the fish tacos - halibut at the time. (Hey, I am pregnant, and I wanted a bite. I can't be denied.) Best fish ever (not that I am an expert on the subject or anything), even though I felt supremely guilty about it afterward.

Anyway, I hate to encourage you to go to Gallo... so go try it, just not when I want to go, so Gallo can maintain super-secret restaurant status in my mind.
