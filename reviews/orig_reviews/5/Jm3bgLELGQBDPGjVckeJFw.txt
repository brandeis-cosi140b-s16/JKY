WARNING: Super Addicting.
Highly recommended is the CHICKEN MOLE BURRITO!! Delicioso. Normally I steer clear of any chain serving mole; but I took a chance, and it does NOT disappoint.
The most tender carne asada, and moist carnitas. 
All the chips/tortillas/sopes are made fresh by hand, which you just can't beat. When you think about the quality of the food, the price is right on point.
The fact that they serve elote is unique and has to be one of the best "snacks" in Container Park!! Yum. Yum. Yum. 
The service is excellent, and it is very likely they will remember you upon return. Real Mexican food from real Mexicans, right here in beautified (in process) Downtown Las Vegas.
