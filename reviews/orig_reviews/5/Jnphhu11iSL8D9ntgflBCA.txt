Had the best time at our wedding reception here. Located in a private room and exceptional service provided by all the staff and manager Christina. The food was so good! We had a selection of gaucho steak (worth the $5 upgrade), chicken enchiladas or Yucatan pork. Our guests loved it all. The guacamole was endless  and the ultimate margarita package is the best way to go! We ordered our wedding cake and floral through them as well and couldn't be happier. Living in NY choosing our reception site unseen was difficult but we made the most affordable and excellent Mexican food choice on the strip. Thank you so much for making our day awesome!
