Oh my LORD- great food! Was in town for a weekend trip. We have the ceviche for an appetizer, it was fantastic! We also tried several tacos- the Chorizo, Duck confit, Korean and Tako w/ octopus. Each were perfectly cooked with incredible sauces. I love the creativity of the menu and cocktails! 

My favorite were the Duck and Octopus tacos! The herbs/ spices they use were so fresh! Our bartender was incredible. Cannot wait to go back the next time we're in town!
