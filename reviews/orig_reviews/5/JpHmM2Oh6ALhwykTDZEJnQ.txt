I understand why Nacho Daddy was voted for best margaritas, their spicy blood orange margarita was not only amazing but it's something you can't get anywhere else! Amazing team, Alex was awesome at taking care of us and super friendly! She recommended the Thai chicken nachos and they were delicious. We will be back to see her and her margaritas! Thanks nacho daddy for a great experience down town.
