Always such amazing food, and an awesome happy hour/late night special. Great for groups or a date night, or sitting solo at the bar. Lots of options for every kind of eater/diet, made clear on the menu and on their website. Vegan options are especially nice, with vegan cheese and sour cream options at no extra cost :)

The prices are usually around 10 bucks a dish, but their portions are HUGE and keep super well for a leftover meal (or two).

I'm a fan of this location since it's so big (although it'll still be packed with an hour wait on a Friday or Saturday night), and in the summer it's a real treat to sit with a Bigazz margarita with the big windows open to Highland Avenue.
