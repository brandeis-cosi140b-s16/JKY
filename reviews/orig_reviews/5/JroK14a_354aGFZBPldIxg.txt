I found this place on unlokt and had to immediately drive out to try it!  I wrote in a recent review how I have been searching for a good Mexican place for a long time and can't seem to find one!  Well...the search is over!!!  I have now found one! 

When we arrived everyone greeted us and welcomed us. It made me chuckle to be enthusiastically welcomed to a Mexican spot...that usually only happens at Japanese restaurants, and even then sometimes they sound like they could care less that I just walked in. Lol. 

I told them it was my first time and the guy smiled and cracked a joke and winked at me. I didn't really understand it so I just laughed anyway lol.  He offered me a sample of this amazing pork they had, and so I tried it.  It was so good!!!!  I told him I wanted a burrito with that pork, and so he started making the pork....then he told me to try this amazing beef that they have and it was even MORE amazing!!!  I changed my mind and  told him to not give me any other samples or I'll keep changing my mind!  :) It was a fun ordering experience for sure.  

In my burrito I got lettuce, beans, a little bit of sour cream and lots of pico.  It was delicious!  I loved it.  Their salsa bar has a ton of salsas, the only thing I wish is that it had some type of description on their salsa bar so I knew what I was getting.  

The food was delicious, the service was awesome, and it is definitely my favorite mexican place right now!  I just wish I could go more often, but it's on the opposite side of town so it's a bit of a drive for me.  I can't wait to go back!
