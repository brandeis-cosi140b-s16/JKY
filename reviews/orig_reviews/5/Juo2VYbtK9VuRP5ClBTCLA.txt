A bit expensive for tacos imho but totally worth it bc they were the best!!!! The owner saw I was taking one to go and asked why and if I didn't like it, I explained they were so good I HAD to take one home to my husband and he said oh no way! He insisted I eat the one I had at the table and made me a fresh FREE one to go for my hubby! #customersforlife
