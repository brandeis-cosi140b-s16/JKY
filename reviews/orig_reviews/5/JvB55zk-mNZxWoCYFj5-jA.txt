I have to admit my husband and I are almost weekly regulars. We first started going here because of their prices being so much more reasonable then our usual Ajo Al's down the street. But, we have been pleasantly surprised with their food. We usually get their "complete" meal and eat enough chips and salsa we almost take the whole meal home and then it feeds us both a big lunch for the next day. Chips and salsa are some of the best and you can't beat their bucket of five domestic beers for $10.00.  We almost paid that for two beers at the other place. I am sure we will be regulars for along time to come.
