Ugh this place is frkn amazing! I love, love tacos and every time we are in Vegas I crave them, weird I know! So I was so happy to find Tacos el Gordo! The tacos are very flavorful, the salsas are good, I just wish they had a hotter one for us chile lovers.. The tortillas are amazing, I love the smell they have ( reminds me of Mexico).  The lengua tacos are so good, the lengua aka tongue is very tender, definitely a must try!  Can't wait to try more stuff off their men√∫!
