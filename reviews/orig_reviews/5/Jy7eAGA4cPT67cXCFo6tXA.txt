Great food, great salsa and surprisingly good coffee at a very reasonable price (make that a low price if you are going for lunch between 11am-4pm).

La Fonda Del Sol is by no means elegant, but that doesn't seem to be the point of this place, i.e. it doesn't need to be.

It's definitely worth checking out if you're in the mood for good non-corporate chain Mexican food.

P.S. Although I've not yet had a chance to try the margaritas (and I hate to post hearsay) they come highly recommended from what I would call a "trusted source." I'll update when I have personal knowledge.
