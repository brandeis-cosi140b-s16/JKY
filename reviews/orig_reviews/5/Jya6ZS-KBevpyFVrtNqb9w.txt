I have been a regular customer in this establishment since 2009. It is unfortunate that it has closed down because of a fire a while ago, but yes, it came back and the quality is still as good as before. Although the price went up a little bit after it reopened, the decor and ambiance has improved by many levels. The service is usually pretty fast. 

We had huarache and three tacos. Yummy. This is one of the best affordable, fast, yet delicious places for a budget foodie like me. 

By the way, I don't know if other Mexican restaurant in town serve the soup "menudo" or not, but they do! The portion is huge. I suggest sharing it with a group of people, otherwise you may end up not able to finish it like us.
