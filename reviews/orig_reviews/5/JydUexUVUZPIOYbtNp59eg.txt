Absolutely incredible experience!

Our party of four had an amazing dining experience at La Hacienda last night. Wow. 

We started with tableside guacamole, highly recommended. Then we had a killer Tequila flight, followed up with Maestro Doebel margaritas, another wow, a must-try. 

The ladies enjoyed the salmon, I had the Pork Carnitas, and my friend had the lamb. All dishes were superb. 

My wife also enjoyed a Cafe Acapulco, which was prepared on a rolling cart with a fire display. So cool!

The service was absolutely wonderful, and Ryan the General Manager was kind enough to visit our table and make excellent recommendations. 

La Hacienda is a hidden jewel, and I highly recommend a visit. We can't wait to go back!
