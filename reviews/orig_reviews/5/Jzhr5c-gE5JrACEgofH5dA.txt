We loved the chips, salsa, and bean dip.  We ordered the quesadilla and the taco salad.  Great service, Great food, and a comfortable atmosphere.  The portions were so large we had leftovers.  My only complaint was that one of the waiters was wearing far too much cologne.  I want to taste my food and not his cologne.
