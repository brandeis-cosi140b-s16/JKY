Quite some time ago I saw this place on Travel Channel's top 50 unique places to eat, or something like that. The idea of a fusion of Oriental and Mexican food intrigued me. knowing that I would not be going to Phoenix any time soon, I put it in the back of my mind.

Ended up in Phoenix on business and needed to find a place to eat. The back of my mind reminded me of some place with Mexican/Oriental fusion. searched Yelp and came up with Chino Bandido and it was only 4 miles from my hotel.

I wanted to experience as many flavors as possible so I ordered an al la cart carnitas burrito & a combination bowl with Jade chicken, chile relleno, jerk chicken fried rice and Cuban black beans. I wish I could have ordered more, but the portion sizes are too big and I would have been miserable, because I would have eaten every bite. The chile relleno was fantastic. the crispy exterior was so unique.

WOW! the flavors exploded in my mouth. The food was great!

The thing that impressed me more than the food was the service. If any one wants an example of  great customer service for a model for their own business after, even without eating a bite of the delicious food a visit to Chino Bandido is would be worth the trip. The staff's compensation is either based on the the satisfaction of the clientele of they are part owners, because everyone of them acted as if it was their business. It was my first visit and I did not know the menu or how to order. No problem. I was greeted by friendly staff who directed me to a line of neophytes. when it was my turn the young lady asked me  some questions and then offered bites of different menu items & explained some of the many options available for me to order. I even had to ask her to cut down the size of the samples so that I would not fill up before ordering.

My only regret is not being able to go back and order some of the menu items I was unable to try.

The 4" snicker-doodle cookie was a very pleasant surprise.
