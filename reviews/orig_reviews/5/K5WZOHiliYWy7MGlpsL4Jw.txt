GET THE CHIMICHANGA! GET THE CHIMICHANGA!

It's a ways off the strip but totallllllllllllllllly worth it! promise.
Found this place through the help of yelp, yeahhh buddy!

Parking: Private lot and I'm sure it helps that there are 3? designated parking spots for KoMex customers! yayy! :D

Service: Is this place family owned? I swear the girl taking my order could care less about being there. She was dragging her feet every direction she had to go. bleh. We were seated as soon as we walked in.. to a verryy dusty table. ): eck. The girl brought the menus right away and gave us a few mins to decide what we wanted. We ordered our food, some chips and salsa/guacamole came and then we realized... we didn't even get place mats! :C which meant no napkins. which means we were just eating on a dusty table. *face palm* -_-'' 

FOOD: Have I mentioned that you should order the CHIMICHANGA?! Well, just in case I haven't... GET THE CHIMICHANGA!
+_Complimentary Chips, Salsa, and Guacamole: The chips were warm when they got to the table and they were DELISH! The salsa was okay but I really enjoyed the guacamole. (:
+_FREE Check-in Fried Wontons!! (; These were sooooo good! I believe they're 4 for $1.00 BUT you can get them for free when you check in :D woot woot! They came with a sweet and sour dipping sauce and were pretty hot in temperature so be careful.
+_Tacos: M'boyfriend ordered one of these babies and it was BOMBB! Juicy, flavorful, warm tortilla, and mm mm good!
+_Bulgogi burrito ( beef with rice, green & brown onions, pico de gallo, cilantro, lettuce, and sauce) : Mehh. I think I HAVE to try it with kim chi next time. It wasn't the head nodding, mmhmm, OMG, mouth full of food kind of experience. However, I will say that it was just as bigg as a chipotle burrito, was still good a couple hours after, and at $4.99 that isn't too shabby.
+_CHIMICHANGA!! (cabbage, onions, cilantro and pico de gallo, topped with Enchilada sauce.) The boyfriend ordered a chimichanga and i was soo jealous I didn't order it! ): PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE order this :D The skin was crispy and it was amazing!

Tips:
+_Check in to get a free order of fried wontons

+_don't sit at a table, try a booth? perhaps they're less dusty.
+_GET THE CHIMICHANGA! it'll be the BEST hang over meal EVER.

I already know what I want to try next! The mongolian beef!
