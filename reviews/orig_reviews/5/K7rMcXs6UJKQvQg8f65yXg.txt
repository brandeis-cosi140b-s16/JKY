This past Saturday we had my Nana's 90th birthday celebration here. From the time we originally booked the private room for the guests, all the way through to the end of the party, this restaurants was AMAZING! 

My family and I cannot say enough good things about this restaurant and their staff. They catered to our family and friends so wonderfully, I didn't have to worry about anything; and there was about 50 of us! Anything we needed, they got it. No one had empty drinks. Food was ready on time, brought out cake when asked, etc. They accommodated our every request. This celebration of my Nana's 90 years couldn't have been any better. How great it was to have someone else do the work, all we had to do was show up and enjoy ourselves. Every single employee was amazing.  Oh and the happy birthday song from all the staff with the guy and the guitar, my Nana loved it. 

Thank you Lindo Michoacan for taking such good care of us and helping our family to create some wonderful memories with our Nana.
