AMAZING!!!!!!!!! by far the best of all of the places such as this.  I have never had a bad meal.  the queso dip is the best I have ever had!  And the fact you get to custom build everything on the menu to your liking is wonderful (especially since Im pregos lol)  The staff is always friendly and smiling.  There hasn't been a time yet that I go there and it is slow, that says something!  The pork nachos are one of the best things!! I recommend sharing them!!  My BF and I usually get two things and share them, that way you get the best of both worlds!!!!
