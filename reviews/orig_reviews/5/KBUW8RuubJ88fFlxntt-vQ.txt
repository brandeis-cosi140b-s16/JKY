I don't really see a problem with the ambiance.  It's a little hole in the wall place, and that's exactly what it reflects.  The patio area is actually pretty cool, but we sat inside.  The salsa was some of the best I've ever had, the drink specials were top notch, and the food was delicious as well.  

I wish I could elaborate more, but trust me, the place is awesome.
