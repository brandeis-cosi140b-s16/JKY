It was our first time here, but we will definitely be coming back. I had the pork verde taco, a margarita, and a sopapilla with honey, and my sister had a chicken combo burrito. Everything was absolutely delicious! I thought I wouldn't have room for the sopapilla, but I would never come here and not have one! The guy was super polite and gave us the sopapilla to try since it was our first time here. It was really busy for a Tuesday evening, but we didn't wait long for our food. My only complaint is that it was really hot and I was sweating in my seat!
