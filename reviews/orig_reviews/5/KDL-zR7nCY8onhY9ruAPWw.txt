I really want to come back to this place, but maybe stay at the hotel. We tried Brunch, hostess was very nice and sat us were we preferred, it was early so we had plenty of options, chose the best of both worlds, near the patio but inside so we could enjoy the AC but have a nice view. Menu was interesting, food was delicious. Server was very nice, gave us suggestions and our food was brought promptly. Alcoholic beverages were a bit pricey... I definitely want to come back and I'll use the free guaca mole that I got for checking in with yelp.  :)
