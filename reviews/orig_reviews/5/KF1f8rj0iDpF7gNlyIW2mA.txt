I have had lots of burgers in my life. Every time I go anywhere I have to order a burger. And I've been wanting to try the stand forever. I was looking for a quick home style burger. One that you can't get at any fast food place. And I found it. Its restaurant-quality burgers with the convienence of a drive through. Absolutely fantastic. The veggies are all so fresh, like yhey were cut right then just foe me, and the "stand sauce" is just right. Its not overpowering and adds just enough to the burger. No need for any other condiments. The Mexican style corn wasn't was I was expecting but it was still amazing!! Corn on the cob with lemon and lime, chili or ceyene or something and parmesean cheese. 
This place is absolutely amazing. And I will be back.
