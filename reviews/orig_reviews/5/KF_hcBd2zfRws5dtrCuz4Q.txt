The ambiance to this place was nice, and can be perfect for a date spot. :) 

I met up with a friend of mine. The hostess that lead me to my table, seem like she didn't like her job at all. I didn't get a grin or smile,nothing.

I ordered the vegetarian New Mexico enchiladas.  OHHH MYYYY GOOOODNESSSSSSS. Deliciousness to my mouth. :)))))))) the rice, beans to the enchiladas was perfect!!!! I almost killed that dish. And you know what else was perfect??  My  pomegranate  margarita. Yes.. very friendly drink :D 

I'll definitely return again.
