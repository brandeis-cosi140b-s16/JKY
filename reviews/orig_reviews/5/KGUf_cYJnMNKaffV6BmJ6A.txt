I love this place but haven't been back in a while due to the fact that the boyfriend and i ate there so much i got a little burnt out, lol..  Not necessarily a bad thing! I'm vegetarian and they have a burrito chock-full of veggies AND tofu! Color me happy! Green sauce is awesome on top,  and food is always fresh and hot. Staff is always friendly. I ate once at the Summerlin location and all was great there, too. I definitely recommend this place for vegan/vegetarians.
