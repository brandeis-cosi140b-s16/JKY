I love this bar.  The GM, Adam, has to be the hardest working guy in the business.  The entire staff is cheerful and attentive; the tacos are slammin.  I come out to the area on business from New England several times a year and this place is my go to any time of day - it's very relaxed; one of the few places where it feels like they actually want be to hang out and enjoy a drink.  When they're considering a new craft beer or tweaking a cocktail recipe, they never hesitate to offer me the opportunity to taste and weigh in.  I love this place.
