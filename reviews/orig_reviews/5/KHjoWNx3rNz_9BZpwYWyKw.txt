At a native to Phoenix I have tried many Mexican restaurants and this place has always been my favorite! 
Best chips and salsa! The chips are usually brought out fresh and hot. There is 2 salsa types (mild and hot). I like to mix the mild and hot. My kids eat the mild. So it's not too spicy at all!
Burrito Fundito with pollo is the best. But I have also had the pollo quesadilla. Love the enchiladas and tostadas. Basically everything is good!!
Margaritas are good. Beer on draft comes in HUGE glass. I ordered a beer and when it got delivered I had to just laugh at the huge glass.
