Near the top of my list for quality mexican food. The price is very fair as well ,being that they are located in Snottsdale. I always get the 3 chicken tacos (street tacos) when we go. I can't help it, they taste sooo good, I can't get myself to try anything else. The rice is outstanding, although they give you only about 2 teaspoons. When we crave mexican, we go to Blanco.
