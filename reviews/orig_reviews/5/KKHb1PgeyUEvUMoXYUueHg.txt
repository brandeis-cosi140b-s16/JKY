Four star food and a bonus star for the excellent customer service!

I have wanted to try this place for ages. It's always hard to get off work in time to get here before they close at 6. Finally, I made it out of work in time to stop by for some food. 

I came in and was greeted by the very friendly owner. He took my order and made some idle chit chat and then went back to cook up my grub. I tried the chicken taco and breakfast burrito with bacon and also took a small bite from my fella's carnitas torta. The chicken in the taco was incredibly moist and filled with lots of cabbage, onion and cilantro. I'm a big fan of all the fresh veggies that are included. Even better with the flavorful and spicy chile. The breakfast burrito was perfectly sized and every bite had the perfect amount of egg, bacon, potato and cheese in every bite. So great when I added the green chile or spicy red on top. The torta was great too. I would probably ask for no mayo if I was ordering for myself, but that's just a personal preference. The meat was really juicy and flavorful.  

Phrank was very friendly and chit chatted with me before during and after our transaction was over. Such a great customer service experience and the food is good and cheap to boot. What more can a girl ask for. Looking forward to making this a regular spot on my food rotation.
