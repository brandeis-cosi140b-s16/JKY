Seriously the best taco place in Las Vegas. I've lived here for 8 years and I've never found a place as good as this. Roberto's is all right if you're looking for convenience cause there's one on every corner but if you're something top notch it's this, especially their Tacos de Adobada. 

The only cons are that on certain nights the lines can be super long. I went last Thursday and the line was absurd. My brother and I had to wait 30 minutes and I am not exaggerating. But anyway, it usually shouldn't be like this. If you're looking for quality tacos, this is the place!
