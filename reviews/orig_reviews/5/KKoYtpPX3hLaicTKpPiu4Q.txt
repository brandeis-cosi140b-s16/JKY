I used to come here all the time a few years ago and then I slowly forgot about it as I got into a new relationship. We decided to pick up takeout because I was craving Mexican. Oh boy, I'm so glad because it's so good! Yes, I'm eating as I'm writing this. I remembered how I always mixed the hot salsa with the mild to get the perfect salsa and they sell pitchers of margaritas! My boyfriend enjoyed his meal, so we're definitely coming back. He even said he'll bring his friends. It's one of my favorite hole-in-the-wall joints! Oh, by the way... I'm eating the chicken fundido! :)
