When ever our family gets together for meals this is definitely our go to place, in fact its where we always go.  I have never ever been disappointed by los.  It is a comfortable sit down place where you can socialize and not feel rushed.  It is typically pretty quite and is a good all around place to eat.  The service has always been pretty good, portions are a nice size and I believe it is worth every penny.  If you are looking for some great Mexican food I would totally recommend this restaurant.
