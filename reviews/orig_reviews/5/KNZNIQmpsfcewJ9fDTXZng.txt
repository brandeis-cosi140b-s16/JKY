The food was sooooooo GOOD!!! I love Mexican food, so I eat a lot of it and I can tell when its authentic. this is one of the best Mexican restaurants I've been to so far in Charlotte. Not only do they give you a healthy serving but the customer service is great! I believe its family owned and the little old lay was just darling. Our food did not take long; margaritas and tacos! it doesn't get any better than that! Not only was the food good but I love the cozy feeling you get in there. If you haven't tried this place you should! its good and affordable.
