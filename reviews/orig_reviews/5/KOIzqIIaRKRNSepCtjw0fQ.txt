Went there on the 24th for a special Ron Cooper Mescal Day of the Dead dinner.
Lots of compliments. First to the host staff for being incredible. Second to the head bar tender ( I forgot her name). Again very friendly and very knowledgable. The dinner was great. All of the tasting items were fabulous. Will have to go back to work the menu, but the 9 course tasting menu was very good. Not OMG, but I did reach a point of having booze goggles on as every course has more mescal. Huge fan of Jaleo, so this wasn't a suprise.
