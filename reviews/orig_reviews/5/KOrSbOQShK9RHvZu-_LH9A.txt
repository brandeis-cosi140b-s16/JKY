We stopped here on our way home from golf. The house margaritas are okay a little sweet for my taste, but 2 for happy hour worked! Salsa is homemade and so good. We each had something different for dinner. ALL the food was delicious! Liked sitting outside on the patio. Will keep this on the return list for sure!!
