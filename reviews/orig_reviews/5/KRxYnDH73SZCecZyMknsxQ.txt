We ate her twice memorial weekend. First time we sat in bar and had drinks and apps. The table side guacamole is VERY good. The Margaritas are very very good.  The menu looked so good we came back two nights later for dinner. It lived up to what we expected. Everything, service, drinks, and food was on point. I suggest getting the guacamole and chips to start. You will have to have waiter remove them because it is hard to put them down. The ceviche is different but delicious and worth trying as well.  It was hard to choose a dinner because it all looked so good but I chose the tenderloin over enchilada's and it did not disappoint me at all. If your in Scottsdale try this place
