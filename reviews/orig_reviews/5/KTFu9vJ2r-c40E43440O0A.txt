Another great experience here. 2nd time there, I seriously can't see a reason why its not 5 stars. 
Sunday Happy Hour all day! :) 
Went back again, enjoyed an awesome HH Meal and Drinks! 
Great Guacamole and their House Salsa was great too! Love their Chipotle Salsa! 
This time, I went for the Pork Tacos on the HH menu! Delicious! Al Pastor is what they really are, and I love Pineapple Pork!! 
Great service again, very attentive waiter.
