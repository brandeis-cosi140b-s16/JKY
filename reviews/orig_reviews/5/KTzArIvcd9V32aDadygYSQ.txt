Very clean place. Friendly owners that seem to know everyone by first name and their order. Food is excellent! We only regret not trying this place before today. This is not a fast food establishment and seating is limited however take out is an option and well worth it! I would highly recommend this place especially the green chili burrito and must try the rice and beans! Hands down the best we have tasted in Az.!
