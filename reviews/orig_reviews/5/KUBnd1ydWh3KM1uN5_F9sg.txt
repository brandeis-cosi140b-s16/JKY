Hands-down my favorite place to get tacos in Madison. And, I'd swear I've already reviewed this place, but apparently I haven't... Hmm. Suffice it to say that I've swung through here at least 7-8 times since discovering it a few months ago.

+ Happy hour. $2 Tecate, $5 for 3 street tacos. Runs until 6pm. Outstanding.
+ Delicious house-made tortilla chips
+ Tasty salsas

+ The street tacos. OMG. Finally!!! Someone who knows how to season and sear asada. Everything about these tacos is perfect - fresh, steamed corn tortillas, mounds of delicious steak, mild white onion and fresh cilantro. Yes, yes, yes. 

+ Service is always friendly and prompt
+ Nice selection of traditional Mexican brews, all at fair prices
