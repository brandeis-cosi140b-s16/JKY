When I lived in California I was always a fan of the smaller burger joints. I rarely like to visit a chain restaurant to eat there. I had been on the hunt for a family owned, divey burger joint and this place would come up over and over in conversations with friends and family. I finally decided to venture into this place when I moved to the east side. 

At first site, the establishment does not look that inviting because of the surrounding businesses. When you walk in, a very lovely pleasent aroma of hamburgers and pizza fills the air.You are greeted warmly by the staff everytime and if you come often enough, they remember your name and order. The menu has a good variety of burgers, hot sandwhiches and pizza. Also, they have the notoriously delicisous Chencho Fries! You get to choose from skinny fries or fat fries which really amazed me at the fact that I had a choice. They are covered with green chili and melted cheese which makes for a delicious flavor profile. 

When someone asks for a recommendation for a good burger joint, people will usually say places like Bachi Burger or Gordon Ramsay's BRGR but THIS is my go to spot. There is nothing like a simple, undercomplicated burger!
