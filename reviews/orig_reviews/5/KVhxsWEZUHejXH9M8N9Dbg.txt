This place is simply clever. Taking the Korean world and fusing it together with the Mexican world, you get KoMex Fusion. Such a brilliant idea and the food does not disappoint the idea. My favorites is the Bulgolgi Nachos. It is very delicious and it gets me craving it just by talking about it. The best part about this restaurant is that the price is so reasonable and the portions are perfect. This is a very unique and delicious food experience!
