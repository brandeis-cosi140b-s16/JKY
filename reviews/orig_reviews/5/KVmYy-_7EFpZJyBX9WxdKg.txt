This place has the BEST tortillas I have ever tried. I get a dozen of their flour tortillas and a quart of their beans and make my own bean burros at home. But when I'm really hungry I order an already made bean burro too and eat it on the car ride home. I LOVE this place. Only negative is they're closed on Sundays :(
