What can you say about Lindo that hasn't been said. I have never had a bad meal here. Ive been to the other, newer, fancier locations but find this one the best! Look out for the Cadillac Margaritas, though! They go down easy but if you have more than one standing up isn't so easy!  I have been going for years, have had pork, beef, chicken, seafood and have simply never been less than completely satisfied!
