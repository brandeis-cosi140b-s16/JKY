I really, really love Distrito. I love food and this place pushes out excellent food. Me and my boo thang have been here twice and he would probably go back almost daily if he could for the fried crab claws. You need to get them, I'm drawing a blank on the name that is on the menu..but track them down and order them. We get an order each even though they are for sharing..delicious. The guac is really good as well ( free with yelp check in). Service is really on point at Distrito. you get the whole Iron Chef feel thanks to this being Chef Jose Garces spot. The cook had brought out complimentary little muffins before dinner, and each dish was brought out and explained ( i love that, makes me feel important for some reason) i like my food being explained to me. It's like verbal food porn. 

Ambiance, design, mood & food is all just incredibly sexy here. Good job.

See you Soon Distrito.
