We used a deal chicken which was a very good value as the menu items vary from 15-33 dollars.  Rather expensive for a Mexican restaurant.  We had a wonderful reception when we arrived. We were greeted by two different people.  Seating was timely and very pleasant.  Our waiter came immediately to our tables, got us started on our Margaritas and brought the included Fundido appetizer which was very good.  Contrary to other reviewers we did get a basket of chips and salsa as well as fresh tortillas within a few minutes of being seated.  The Margaritas are big and really good.  Again, to get 2 each was a great deal.  Our waiter, Trent, was very pleasant, efficient and nice.  No bad attitude about the deal chicken voucher.  I had the taco plate, shrimp, beef and chicken served with beans, rice and 3 more tortillas.  Good but a lot to eat!  My daughter had a spicy chicken dish, she really liked it but, like me, said it was too much food.  It seems the reviews here are based on the poor service as opposed to the quality of food but I have to give the establishment 5 stars because I can't fault to service in the least.  They really went out of their way to make sure we had a good time.  We sat inside, too hot outside, but there were 20 or more people enjoying the evening on the beautiful patio under the mister system.  Would I go back?  Yes, with a deal chicken.  Had we paid full price the dinner would have been over $100 total  including the drinks which to me is too pricy for a Mexican restaurant.
