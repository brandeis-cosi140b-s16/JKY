We got there...there was a wait...it was so crowded that some people had to stand to eat their food and it was soooo damn worth it.

From the folk Mexican art depicting Santo and Freda Kahlo's uni-brow to the leather and rough wood La Condesa is as much a treat to the eyes as to the nose and mouth.

We are so used to fiery Tex-Mex here in Arizona that it is hard to believe that there is another side to good Mexican food....a delicacy of flavor that counts on subtle textures and refreshing herbs and vegetables to cool our palates and the heat of Southwest days.

I tried every one of the salsas available on Saturday and I can still taste the peanut salsa while I dream of the strawberry salsa (and the cilantro cream salsa and the chipotle...you get the picture).

We split the dogfish and carne asada tacos along with a mahi burrito and were too stuffed to make our way any farther down the menu, guaranteeing we'll be back for more.

Any complaints? Only the smallest of one....I actually prefer water to soft drinks with my meals and appreciate a reasonably sized cup (I promise I won't steal the Coke). I was given an 8oz styro cup filled with ice, necessitating several trips to the counter to ask for more. Totally rediculous since the soft drink dispenser is behind the counter and I couldn't rip them off if I wanted to ;-) ....and yet another styro cup waiting over a thousand years to biodegrade in a landfill.

La Condesa is what a good taqueria should be, just make sure to weedle a paper cup out of the cashier if you quieres agua.
