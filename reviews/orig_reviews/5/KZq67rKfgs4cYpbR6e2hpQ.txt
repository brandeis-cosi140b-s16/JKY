Even better food than the Lindo location in Henderson just without the view.  

Consistently good food and lively atmosphere.  Our server Mimi was awesome.  She was engaging, funny and took great care of us.  We will ask for her next time we go here.  

The food is super fresh, well prepared and plenty of it.  The tortillas are amazing and we can't get enough of them.  This is my favorite place when I want Mexican food.
