I loved Taco Guild! Such a nice remodel to the church- they still have some of the original photos and paper copies in the restaurant as decor. I loved the food, they have a simple menu and the wait staff has always been very helpful when I go, they take the time to sit down and talk to you about the menu. No dress code either, come as you are. I'll definitely visit again and again!
