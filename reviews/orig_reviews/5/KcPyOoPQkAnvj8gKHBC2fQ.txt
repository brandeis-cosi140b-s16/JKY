Our bartender Ron was friendly & attentive. We just wanted to stop in for a few quick drinks & chips, he made it an enjoyable experience by giving us such friendly & prompt service.  I ordered a Stella on tap & although they had just run out he quickly had them replace the tap so I didn't have to wait at all.
