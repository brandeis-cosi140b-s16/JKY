This was our first time to Nacho Daddy. When reading the reviews it seems like a love hate kind of thing. We decided that we would check it out and form our own opinion. We will definitely be going back. Our server Keyson asked us if this was our first time there and made some suggestions. My Sweetie had the enchilada nachos and I had the Thai chicken nachos. My Sweetie's plate was delicious but the Thai nachos are by far the most tasty thing I have eaten maybe ever. Spicy with layers of flavor, texture,and complexity. Who would have known that nachos could be raised to that kind of level. We didn't have any adult beverages because he had to go to work and I had some things to get done after dinner. But next time I plan to check out the guava Margarita and maybe a Scorpion Shot. Our server, Keyson was friendly, attentive and made the experience super fun. I will be in his debt for suggesting the most freaking awesome thing I've eaten in a long time.
