God I love this place.  We usually go late morning during the week.  Belly up to the bar and enjoy some great mimosas and amazing food.  Love that I can watch all of the food being made, and the smell of the wood burning stove.    

I like just about everything on the menu but my favorite is the cheese enchiladas with red sauce (I could drink the stuff).  My husband loves the huevos rancheros.  What ever you order is a huge amount of food.    

It is a small, dim lit "dive" which makes it even more appealing to me.   By far my favorite stop when in Phoenix.
