We have patronized Juan Jaimes T&T a few times now and have always had a great experience. 
This last trip was by far the best. Kudos to Jaclyn who made our last experience one of the best ever. We have an 8 month old so dining out can be an experience to say the least. From the moment we were seated she expressed genuine interest in our little guy and did many little things to make dining out with him as easy as could be. She was extremely friendly and was on top of everything. 
The food has been awesome every time and I recommend both the grilled steak and shrimp as your meat of choice. The guacamole is excellent as well. 
We will continue to frequent T&T and recommend it to all out friends!

You guys rock!
