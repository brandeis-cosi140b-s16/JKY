I come here about once every two weeks after work and grab one of their tables outside.  I love their chips and salsa - and their happy hour prices are reasonable.  I always get the cheese quesadilla (which is marked down for happy hour)  and it never disappoints.  The service is always excellent and the establishment is very clean.  It's a great place whether you are dining alone or with a group.
