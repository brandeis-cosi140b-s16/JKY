Sooo glad I gave this restaurant another shot.  Except that it was hot as hell out, we had a great experience.  We were seated after only a minute or two wait.  Our waitress was super friendly (a recent Chicago transplant) and came around just the right amount of times.  

As always, the food and drinks were supurb.  I got the margarita of the week, watermelon mint. YUM  I made the mistake of getting the medium instead of the large and had to get a second...lol.  My guy got a tall boy PBR can after his draft beer...hilarious.

We got the chips and salsa app.  These are some of my favorite house made chips in Vegas and their red and green salsas are delicious.   The pico is just okay, in my opinion.  For entrees we got Carne Asada and shrimp tacos.  The Carne Asada was cooked perfectly and the shrimp was okay.  Unfortunately, we were too tanked up on chips & drinks to enjoy the entr√©es, but they were good.
