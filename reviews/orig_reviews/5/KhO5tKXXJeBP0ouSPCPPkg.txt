Every time I come here I get great service.  The managers are caring and the wait staff is attentive.  The happy hour is a great value, their blended margaritas are delicious and they have the best salsa I have ever had. The venue is also beautiful, inside of an old church. When the sun comes through the stained glass windows it is magical.  Last night we met friends there and as the server was clearing the table, one of the empty taco sleeves fell and grazed my boyfriend's back and red sauce got on his shirt. The server let him know right away, brought over soda water to clean it, then the manager came by with a Tide stick and spot cleaned his shirt. Then he left his card and asked us to send him the bill for the dry cleaning. Then as we left, the manager came by again and gave us a discount card and insisted that we take his business card, as my boyfriend had left it on the table.  I noticed too that they bought us all a round of drinks.  It was over the top nice and their efforts were really appreciated.
