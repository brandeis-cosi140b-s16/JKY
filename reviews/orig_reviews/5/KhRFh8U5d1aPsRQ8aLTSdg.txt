Better than the location in Scottsdale. I gave them 4 stars because of hit or miss service. I've been to this location twice and have had a flawless experience both times. Fox Concept Plaza (which is what I'm calling that area) offers a lot of tough choices for dinner. The service at these locations versus Scottsdale is night and day better.
