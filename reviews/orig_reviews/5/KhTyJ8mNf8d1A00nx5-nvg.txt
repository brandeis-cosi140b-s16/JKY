Edit: Changed from four to five stars because I must've been smoking crack the day I only gave them four stars.
Their burgers and fries are delicious and reasonably priced. I would recommend trying the brulee burger. This one was definitely the winner in my book (how can it not be, it combines 2 of my favorite meals: burgers and breakfast). The people that run  the place are very passionate and nice. The only thing they could improve on is their to-go fries are a lot smaller than the portions you receive eating in the restaurant since they use these tiny paper bags. And their fries are so good that I want the same amount I get eating at the place, dammit!
