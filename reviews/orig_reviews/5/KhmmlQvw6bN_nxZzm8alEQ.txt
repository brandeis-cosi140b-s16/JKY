So I have this phobia of lines...long lines. And when it comes to Vegas clubs on the weekend you can usually expect to wait. But not for me at Diablos Cantina! 

I gotta say usually when im in vegas I'm all about the fancy resturants and playing pretentious, but this place won a special place in my heart. 

The drinks where cheap, the dancers where hot....and friendly, and the dance floor wasn't crap. I'd come back here to get wasted enough to forget half of it any time!
