They have huge delish salads.  They are just amazing!  And, they are nothing at all like Chipotle, they are miles better!  I just wish they had churros :]  yum!

Anyways, I only go there and eat the salads.  Like i said, they are huge.  They take a hand made flour tortilla, and put it at the bottom, and then stack beans, meat (optional), lettuce, pico, guac, cilantro, and cheese.  I usually eat it with the cilantro ranch (at least i think its cilantro), and its delish, and super filling.  In fact, the salad is big enough for 2 people to split.   I do love this place!
