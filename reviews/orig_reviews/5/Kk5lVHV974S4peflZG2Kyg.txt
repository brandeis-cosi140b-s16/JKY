Don't let the location fool you!  This place serves fresh food.  Our dinner was fresh!! Fresh veggies, fresh meats, fresh salsas...a nice change from most Mexican restaurants where everything is greasy and overloaded with fat.  I highly recommend getting the street taco platter and pick which one u like the most!

My wife had the Flan and described it as the best flan she had ever had...not too runny and not to hard, just right.  The executive chef came out to greet us and offered us $10 off breakfast.  Overall this place is great and we will be back with friends and family.  MAKE RESERVATION** it fills up fast
