BEST TACOS IN VEGAS! HANDS DOWN. ONLY THING BETTER IS IN MEXICO.

You can walk in with a beer or drink. Security will simly give you a brown bag. 

The adobada is the best. All that is missing is a big pot of home made beans.

Toursist and locals all eat here it seems like because it's lawys busy.

ENJOY
