Nice atmosphere, good food, what else can one ask for. Service was attentive and I really enjoyed the habanero salsa. Portions are small but that is what you get when you order street tacos. The noodle dishes are larger and more filling. Nicely priced but you will spend a lot if you are hungry. Fun joint in a hot spot!
