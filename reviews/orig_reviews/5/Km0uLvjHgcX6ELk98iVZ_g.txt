I kept reading all of the reviews about Barrio on Yelp and was dying to check it out. I finally go to go with a couple family members and a friend on a Thursday night. 

As I'm sure everyone has posted the wait is insane. And the parking is limited. But it's one of those places that you almost don't want to get bigger because the size and scope just adds to its charm.  The wait also gave us (and others) plenty of time to sample their STRONG and fantastic margaritas. After one I was pretty sure I would not be the dd. 

The food was incredible. The guac was fresh and wonderful. I had chile rellenos for the meal and was beyond impressed. Everyone I was with loved their choices and we had a great time. 

The only downside that I noticed was the fact that Barrio is located at 24th st and Thomas, is supposedly a 'Barrio' cafe, and yet the crowd was completely comprised of white yuppie-ish folks...not to knock that cause I def tend to be one...but I hope that it is patronized by a myriad of people instead of becoming just another gentrified cafe spot that the neighbors wont go to.
