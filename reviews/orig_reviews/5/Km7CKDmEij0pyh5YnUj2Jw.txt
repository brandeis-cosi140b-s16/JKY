Inexpensive and quality Mexican food! 

This is what I'm talking about!  I frequent this place and order either the Chicken Burrito or Three Chicken Tacos. 

They are so generous in the chicken in the burrito, you could just eat the burrito itself for lunch and be full.  I love their green salsa as well.

If you order three chicken tacos, they do not skimp on the chicken and pour on the lettuce and cheeses. 

I've had other food here in the past (carne asada burrito, chicken chimichanga, Super beef nachos, California Burrito, beef and chicken tortas.

The point is, come in hungry, come out happy.

This location is the best one I've been to yet in Las Vegas.  There is a reason I keep coming back here for sure. :)
