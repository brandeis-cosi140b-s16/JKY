My husband and I recently ate here and could not have left any happier and pleased of our meal.  We had planned on the three course pre show choices but our server made the suggestion of the all you can eat tapes menu for $3 more. Omg the best decision we made.
We were first told that we would get to pick what we got up our server ended up picking for us.  We basically at all the apps and over half the main courses. 
What we enjoyed most was items we would have never even considered ordering actually ended up being some of the best food we ate all night. Now of course there was a few items we didn't enjoy but when you end up getting 19 plates that is a given. 
We left feeling stuffed and really just wanted to sleep off dinner at the table, but we are so thankful to an amazing server for telling us about. This was the best Mexican food we have ever had and recommend to anyone if you can do this you so should.
