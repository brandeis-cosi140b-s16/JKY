Delicious food! We started with some very tasty guacamole and then I had the veggie fajitas. They were pretty simple, just peppers/ onions, guacamole, and beans in a tortilla (I am vegan) but I added a little salsa on top and it was fantastic. So good, in fact, that I ate the whole thing and it was definitely a large portion---I was totally stuffed. The drinks, atmosphere and service were great. A little pricey but for Vegas not too bad and worth it!
