I either tip 15% or 0, but this was a phenomenal experience. Our server Ron was beyond exceptional, to the point that i let the manager know how good he was. He didn't go over the top, just polite, attentive and available!!!!! After checking in through Yelp and discovering we got a "free margarita" ($8 house, not a $13 waborita) the manager went so far as to comp us 2 waboritas!!!!! Now mind you, we dropped $215 between the 7 of us, during a quick lunch, but i was extremely impressed with the quality of service here. Hats of to you Sammy!!!!
