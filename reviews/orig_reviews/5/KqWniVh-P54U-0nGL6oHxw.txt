Best mex seafood in the valley.  The staff is always very welcoming and attentive.  The grilled fillet of fish and the shrimp en diablo are two of my favorites.   The meals fill you up, without leaving you feeling heavy afterwards.   The salsas are amazing as well.   This place is just a great little seafood joint.   I recommend it to everyone.
