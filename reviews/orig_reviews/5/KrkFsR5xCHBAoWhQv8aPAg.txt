Wow, this authentic taco restaurant is legit! Aside from the cool & loco ambience, I have finally come across the mouth-watering street tacos I've been looking for in Phoenix, ever since we moved here a few years ago. 

If it's your first time, let them know and they'll kindly give you a sample of all their tasty meats. And boy oh boy, are they tasty! So much flavor goin' on whether you settle for the Barbacoa, el pastor, tinga chicken or whatever! 

I ordered a churro for dessert, but I had no idea there was vanilla creme goodness lurking inside. Even better!

All in all, you can't go wrong with amazing street tacos, excellent service, and a dining environment that reminds me of NACHOOOOOO Libre. 

Definitely looking forward to coming back here regularly. Yes, their street tacos are that good, folks.
