I've never been to Distrito at night, but recently I had the $15 lunch which comes with two courses, or tapas. I ordered the tortilla soup and the strip steak tacos. The flavors were amazing; really outstanding, quality ingredients. The portion size was a little small, but this is understandable because it is supposedly a "tapas" restaurant. If you're really hungry, I would recommend ordering an additional appetizer. 

I noticed that Distrito had churros on their dinner menu but not on their lunch menu. I asked if I could order them anyway and they were very obliging. I'm so happy I asked, they were PERFECT. Soft in the center, and accompanied by two different delicious dipping sauces. I will return for the churros, if nothing (or everything!) else.
