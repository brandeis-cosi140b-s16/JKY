I'm in town with 3 other friends.  The women are off doing their thing on a Sunday, so me and the other guy decide to head to a locals casino in Henderson.  On the way, I suggest we stop and get a couple burritos at Carlito's.  It's 2 for 1 for breakfast burritos on Sunday.  The other guy, Norman, is from New York.  He gets a sausage breakfast burrito with red sauce.  I get a chorizo with red sauce and smothered in green (oh, yeah, baby, I can mix red and green).  Norman never puts his burrito down.  He loves it.  Can't stop eating it.  He spends the rest of the week telling his wife how good it was.

So on Friday, our last day in Vegas, I'm driving Norman's wife to Carlito's so she can find out what the fuss is about.  We split a sausage breakfast burrito, drenched again in green sauce.  She's now raving about the place.

Bottom line: they do a superb job at burritos.  And what's so good about burritos?  It's food wrapped in other food, which is always better!
