While passing through Phoenix we had a wide-selection of restaurant options to choose from. So glad we picked Playa Hermosa! All I can say is: WOW!! Our food was delicious and SO incredibly fresh!! A surprise from a non-coastal region. I ordered the Seven Seas Soup and in addition to it being chocked-full of seafood, the broth was flavored to perfection! The ambiance was festive and nicely decorated, very clean, and the staff, friendly, attentive and professional. Great place - don't miss it if you are looking for an unusually nice, casual and very reasonably priced dining experience!
