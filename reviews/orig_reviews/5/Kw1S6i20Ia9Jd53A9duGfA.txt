This location is not the original...however the food is just as good. It is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants and I have been coming to Rosas for 15+ years (original location)...
The key is to dip thr chips in the red and green salsa and make a combo pack, so good! My favorite menu item is the veggie burrito with green sauce...but the shrimp tacos and flying saucer with beef are amazing too! The wait sucks during dinner time so just be aware of that and the service is sometimes questionable...but the food clearly makes up for it.
