Yummers. As an Austinite, I give Tex Tubb's my stamp of approval. All of their veggie tacos are super delicious, and I'm a big fan of their tomate salsa (the mild one). The avocado frite taco is probably my favorite though. I wish they wouldn't charge for chips and salsa but their chips are pretty good. Also, their 2 taco platters a great value. 2 tacos and a side for $7.99. Their house-pickled veggies are delicious.
