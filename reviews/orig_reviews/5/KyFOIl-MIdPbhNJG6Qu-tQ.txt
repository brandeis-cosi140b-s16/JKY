Best Mexican food ever! The beans are amazing - just like Nana's! I love the potato and beef tacos as well as the shrimp cocktail. I used to be a Poncho's on Central die hard but this place has a bigger menu selection and it's sooo good! If you want inexpensive authenticate Mexican food then this is your place! Love the cups of sopa they give you during lunch as a free appetizer along with the chips and salsa. Closed on Monday's so keep that in mind. Enjoy!
