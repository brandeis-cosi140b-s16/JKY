We really enjoyed this place. It's to bad it's so far from our home. The food was excellent and the nachos were insane. At least two people can share nachos here maybe three.  Love the atmosphere and great music. The man that brought out our food was way more energetic than our server but she wasn't bad. Love the kids meals and prices. We'll be back.
