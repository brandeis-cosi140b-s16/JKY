By far the best carnitas I have ever eaten!  Did I mention they come with fresh hot flour tortillas?  So delicious!

We also had the Mahi Mahi and it was so delicious.  Just the perfect portion.

Their rice and beans are also wonderful!  I normally discard the rice and beans at Mexican restaurants but not at Isabel's. 


Both our meals went perfectly with their house margaritas.

So happy to have Isabel's in the neighborhood!  

A great restaurant!!
