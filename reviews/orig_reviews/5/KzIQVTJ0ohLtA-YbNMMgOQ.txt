Muy bueno!!!  Carlos pours a really nice clean margarita.  Or sip on a yummy tequila of one of the bartenders' recommendations.  The chips are served warmed, and the food certainly has a more chic twist on your standard Mexican plate.  The patio is cute, and the bar set-up puts you in the vacation mood.
