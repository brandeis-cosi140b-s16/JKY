I have tried getting reservations at Mundo on numerous occasions before going to the Smith Center and they are always booked weeks in advance. I FINALLY had lunch at Mundo yesterday and it was Amazing. Great food, good service, beautiful atmosphere! The experience was everything I heard it would be and more!
