Visited on recommendation of a neighbor.  We were not disappointed!  The service was great, and the food came out quickly and was seasoned to perfection.  We ordered an appetizer and two entrees.  The timing between them was perfect.  We never needed to request a refill and our waiter was on top of every request without hovering.

I would definitely recommend this restaurant to friends.  Great neighborhood hang out!
