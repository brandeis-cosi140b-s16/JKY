I was one of the lucky attendees at the Devour event this past weekend (which was awesome) and had this awesome taco. That's how it all started. A simple fish taco that blew me away. I visited the original Joyride Taco Shop out in Gilbert several months ago when they first opened but it fell off my radar. How silly of me. 

So one taco was not enough and I found myself up the street after Devour closed up shop and I definitely was not disappointed! What an incredibly beautiful restaurant! Chowed down on the Chilaquiles - enjoyed some cucumber mint aqua frescas (with vodka - so cool that they offer it with your choice of spirit), ate way too many chips, and shuffled into a cab that the staff was more than happy to call for me. The service was stellar, the food was amazing, and the ambiance after the weekend rain was incredible. (I still can't believe that I ate an entire meal after Devour - my waistline definitely does not thank me. Ahh gluttony . . . .)
