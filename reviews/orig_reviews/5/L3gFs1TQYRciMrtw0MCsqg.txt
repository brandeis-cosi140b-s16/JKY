I love this place!!! :-) the only reason I tried it was because tacos and tequila are my two most favorite things in the world lol...well they got they both just right.  The tacos are delicious,  meat cooked and seasoned perfectly.  The margaritas are made just right, strong lol!!! I also recommend the shrimp civichie appitizer. It was a pleasantly surprising sweet instead of the usual. Great place !!!!
