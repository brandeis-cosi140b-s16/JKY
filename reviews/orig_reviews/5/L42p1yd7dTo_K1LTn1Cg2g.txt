Yeah I was a little suspect of the fusion possibilities between Korean and Mexican but left a believer!  If you are remotely close at lunch or dinner time, you won't be disappointed by making sure you stop by.

They were crowded but efficient and we were able to sit down within 10 minutes.  Staff was friendly and attentive.  The food was awesome and well priced.  You can't go wrong here.
