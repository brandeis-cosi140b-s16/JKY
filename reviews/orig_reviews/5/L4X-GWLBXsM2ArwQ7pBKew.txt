Carnitas hacienda - slow braised pork, chicharron, avocado salsa, and sweet corn habanero slaw for me.  Camarones Tequila with bean gordita, Rajas corn crema, salsa Chipolte, and pico de gallo for my wife.  Wash it down with two Corona light michelada style capped by a sniffer of Clase Azul Ultra.  Mexican food at its finest!!
