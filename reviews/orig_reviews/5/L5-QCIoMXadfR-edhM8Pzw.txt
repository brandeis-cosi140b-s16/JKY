This place is legit as hell. We went here on the advice of a regular and what a great call it turned out to be. That road is under construction for the light rail but that isn't stopping the locals. Salsa, beans, and chips  to start. All good. We had 2 lunch specials: chicken quesadilla and spinich enchilada both outstanding. It was the little details like the quality of the rice that stand out. Not many places do really good rice.  tvs and iced tea I got to follow the olympics and espn and get a great meal.
