Went to Sandbar today for the first time with coworkers for happy hour. We got there around 2:45 and waited until 3pm to order when happy hour started. I LOVED the atmosphere and the vibe, music and the DJ they had! We didn't end up eating much, but the chips and salsa and green salsa were great. I will go back soon for more!
