Maria is awesome sever, chef and manager are super nice, they make you feel like family!  Best chips and salsa on planet make sure to ask for hot sauce it is amazing but deadly hot, I use just a drop with medium sauce!

Pork tacos and steak fajitas are awesome along with the black beans had cilantro rice!  Very family friendly for kids with great kids meal for 6 dollars that includes beverage and dessert!
