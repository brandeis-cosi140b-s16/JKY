We've been going to on the border for over 15 years and love Monterey ranch chicken fajitas.
I just wish they would bring back the ultimate loaded queso. They will make it if we ask for it but we have to tell every waiter how it's made or else they bring us the wrong queso.  Overall I love the place and keep going back.
