I've driven by this place a number of times and finally stopped in to try it and it was delicious! I ordered the shrimp burrito and a Mexican coke for about $11. The burrito was great; shrimp was cooked perfectly, not overdone, very fresh guacamole and cabbage. I was with my boyfriend and a friend and they gave us a bowl of salsa with our order but no chips... Very weird but we decided to order some chips to actually enjoy the salsa which cost another $3. Marketing tactic? Maybe, and if so, it's working. The salsa was fresh, not too spicy, and really tasty. I'll definitely be coming back!
