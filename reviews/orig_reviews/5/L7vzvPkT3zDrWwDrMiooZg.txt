LOVE this place!!! it is really welcoming, authentic and fricken good!! good chips and salsa, pretty standard menu, but i go for the sweet potato enchiladas every single time bc they are sooo good!! sweet, creamy and delicious! and a really surprising compliment to black beans covered in cheese and nice spanish rice!!
finish it off with some deep-fried ice cream and im done sonnn!!
