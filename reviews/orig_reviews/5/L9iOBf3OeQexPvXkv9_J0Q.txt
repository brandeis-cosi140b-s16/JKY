3 Commandments to Tacos El Gordo

1) Learn Spanish or bring an amigo who does. They seriously do not speak English here. I am not very good at Spanish so I had to communicate through a series of grunts and broken Spanish phrases that had nothing to do with ordering food.

2) Stand in the different lines based on the different type of tacos you want. You order your tacos and then after you get them you bring them all up to the cash register. Grab the condiments, limes, beets, etc. on the side next to the soda fountain. Order a cup of horchata to help wash down the tacos. 

3) Get the loaded carne asada fries. These things are amazing and ginormous. Please do not get one to eat all by yourself. You need at least 3 other friends to eat with. You may pass out or hurt yourself while operating heavy machinery. 

Heed these rules and you will have partaken in one of the most legendary Mexican food experiences of your life.
