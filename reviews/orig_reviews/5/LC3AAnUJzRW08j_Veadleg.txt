Seriously the best tacos in town.  My favorites are the carne asada tacos and the adobada tacos.  Their carne asada fries are worth a try too.  The adobada taco meat is carved right off the slab and onto your taco.  If you are only going to order one kind of taco, GET THIS ONE.  The workers here are quick and efficient.  I would suggest getting 4-5 tacos to fill you up.  They are open until 2 am on the weekdays and 4 am on the weekends, which is a nice plus!
