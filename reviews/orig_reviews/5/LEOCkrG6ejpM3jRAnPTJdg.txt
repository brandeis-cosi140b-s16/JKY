So happy to have stumbled upon this place while shopping it's a definite comeback to restaurant for our future trips.

Service: 5 stars. We were seated quickly and the food was well paced. Our waiter was friendly yet not overbearing. Clearly knew the menu, offered great suggestions, and took note on our special requests.

Food: 5 stars! Thank god for advertising or else we would have by passed this place. On the board outside the restaurant each colored slide of their food looked amazing, orgasmic we kept moaning and commenting on every picture haha. When girls are hungry! Lol. And we can now add that the pictures live up to the hype!!!. Everything was fantastic here, wish we would have tried more. The queso fundito was amazing amazing, the highlight of the appetizers. Their tacos plates are awesome as well, I'd recommend the sampler plate but if I had to recommend one I'd say go with the carnitas. Even the little things were good, awesome rice and beans.

A tecate with lime juice and Ice brought the final scoring up to 5 stars! Can't wait to come back next vacation. So yummy!
