Great food. Great margaritas. Great prices. 

FOOD
They had some specials: the steak enchiladas with red sauce ($8) and the chicken enchiladas with green sauce ($8). So we got 'em. And they were muy awesome. I was not expecting the food here to be as good as it was. 

Now we have to go back for their crazy breakfast specials: $5 eggs, bacon, potatoes and tortillas and $1 bloody marys. What?

YARD LONG MARGARITAS
Told our waitress (Rosy D) we had gotten yard long margaritas elsewhere before and they tasted like watered down water with extra shots of water and then blended (with frozen water). She recommended we get their "better" yard long (an extra $10) - I'm pretty sure it had Patron - and to get it on the rocks (not blended). She guaranteed it would be good. It was. In fact it was one of the BEST MARGARITAS I've ever had, yard long or not. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this one. Warning: it will knock you on your ass. 

We were not expecting this place to be as good as it was. Next time we're back in Vegas we're definitely going back! Thanks Rosy!
