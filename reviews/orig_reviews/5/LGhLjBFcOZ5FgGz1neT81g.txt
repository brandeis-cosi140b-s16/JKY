We would of never stopped at Mercadito - little market in Spanish - because we are not fans of cheesy, tawdry Mexican restaurants that lack culinary creativity and merely slop rice and beans awash in cheese sauce on a plate, however, when we checked in the desk clerk raved about the restaurant and gave us two free drink tickets. Fortunately, Mercadito is a upscale, trendy Mexican restaurant serving an imaginative menu of delicious, intriguing small-plates of traditional Mexican and designer Mexican nibbles. 
We had Tacos, which can only be described as exciting, are served four to a plate, include the usual suspects but also offer versions with huitlacoche, mushrooms, Manchego cheese and salsa verde; and shrimp with roasted garlic, chipotle mojo and avocado. Charcoal-edged, bright pink slices of rosemary-marinated skirt steak make the tacos carne memorable; the taquizas, or assemble-it-yourself tacos, include a Berkshire pork carnitas version 

THE MARGARITAS ARE EXCELLENT!! Try the one made with mezcal which adds an intense smoky flavor. Not to be missed are the Mercadito's Aqua Frescas which are pur√©ed daily. I loved the ginger- lime and the cucumber-lime. Of course we had to have dessert, toasted coconut flan, and it was simply amazing - I cannot stop thinking about it. 

We sat at the bar and Gus took excellent care of us. We would return just for the level of service we received. All-in-all one of our best dining experiences after 5 days in Las Vegas.
