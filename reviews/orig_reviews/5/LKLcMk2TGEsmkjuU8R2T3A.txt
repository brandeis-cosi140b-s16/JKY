Amazing brunch! 

There were three of us sharing the brunch plates and two of us drinking mimosas. Favorite mimosa was the pomegranate and (some) of our favorite plates were the steak and eggs, salmon sliders, french toast and breakfast fries. But really, everything was great and you should definitely let your waiter suggest some for you.. Thats what we did!
