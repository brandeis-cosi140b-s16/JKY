Awesome place to come if your in the strip and craving them tamales!! (Chicken with green salsa are my fav :D). Of all those 11 years I've been there, the chips are always warm.(their chips are soo addicting !!). The staff are very friendly and are gladly available for your assist. If you you still have room for dessert don't hesitate to order their epic fried ice cream( my grandmother can't get of that sh!t lol).This restaurant can also be a really good place to hold a reservation or party. Ohhhh and there's FREE WIFI!!Overall, tamales do√±a Maria is a great place to take the family out for a Mexican restaurant.
