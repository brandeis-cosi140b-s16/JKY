Everytime we stay at New York, New York we eat at this restaurant. The staff is friendly and the food is delicious. We love the table side guacamole and Patron margaritas.  Highly recommend going to this restaurant. We were at the restaurant for Super Bowl and Mary took wonderful care of is. We had a great time!
