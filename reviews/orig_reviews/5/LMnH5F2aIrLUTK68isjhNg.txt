Tee Pee hasn't changed in more than 50 years, which makes them the most authentic Old Phoenix-style mexican food in the Valley.  I think all they've done is keep the place clean.  I took my son there recently.  It was just like when my dad used to take me to his favorite mexican spots that were all over town back then.  Tee Pee is the only one left.  Even more important than the nostalgia is the great food - fresh, hot chips, cold beer, and tasty red chile wrapped in a tortilla and covered in red sauce.  My son loved it and so did I.
