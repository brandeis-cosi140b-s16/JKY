I read some of the reviews for this place and had to laugh. Most of the people who said the food is terrible are probably used to Sonoran Mexican food. This is Mexico city style! I grew up on the Mexican border in Texas and spent a lot of time visiting family in Mexico. I have to say after moving to Arizona 3 years ago I had given up on "good" Mexican food because I hate Sonoran style food. I stumbled upon this place stopped in for dinner and fell in love! I felt like I was finally having a taste of home. The food is authentic and the service is great! Staff is friendly and attentive. Also I read someone say they charge you for refills on drink which is no longer the case! Everyone looking for a change from the usual Sonoran style of AZ should try this place!
