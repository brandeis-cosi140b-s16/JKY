This place was recommended by a co worker. I went on Taco Tuesday. $2 margaritas and $1 off the tacos. The chips and salsa were okay. I ordered the pork belly and Carne asada tacos. They were both great! The slaw that came on the pork taco added a great taste to the taco. The meat in the Carne taco was cooked perfectly. The service was wonderful. I will be going back soon!
