I drive past this place all of the time. I finally stopped in tonight, and I am so glad I did!  The menu is not huge, but big enough to offer variety. I chose all carne asada--2 tacos, a quesadilla, beans and rice, and a spicy burro-all to take home and split with my hubby. Everything was so good! The carne asada was tender and perfectly seasoned. We will definitely return for future carry out. Yum Yummy!
