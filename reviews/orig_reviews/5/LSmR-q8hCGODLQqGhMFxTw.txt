This place is amazing! The selection of authentic meats, toppings, served in tacos, burritos and quesadillas were excellent. If the line is not long let the people there let you know that you are a first time visitor and they immediately thank you for coming to the restaurant and start handing you samples of the spicy meats to see which you like the best. Also, the salsa bar has authentic salsas from mild to extremely hot. Clean and fun dining environment. I will be back and bring my friends!
