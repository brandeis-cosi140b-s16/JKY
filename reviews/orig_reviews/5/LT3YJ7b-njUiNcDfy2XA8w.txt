YUM!!!  This place is absolutely delicious!  I'm 32 years old and have been coming here since I was 8!  I have never been disappointed with the food in all the years I've been coming here.  My all time favorite is their red tamales.  I get it without the red sauce but with cheese on top.  I also love their mini shredded beef chimi's and I could eat bowl after bowl of their chips and salsa.  I could seriously live off of Pedro's. I was just there last week for dinner and already can't wait to go back!
