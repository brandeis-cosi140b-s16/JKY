So amazing!  This is the best taqueria I have found in the area by far. While waiting in line the guy taking our order had us laughing and made us feel at home. 
The food was great. I had a al pastor burrito and it was so flavorful. I liked that it wasn't loaded with pineapple like other places sometimes have. The tortillas seemed like they were homemade or very fresh and great quality. 
I will definitely be back for the carne asada and carnitas... And of course more al pastor!
