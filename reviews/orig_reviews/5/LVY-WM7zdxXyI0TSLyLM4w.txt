Lindo's is great. On a busy Friday night, we were seated within 10 minutes and the waiter was so accommodating. Food was great too and came out hot and just as expected. Beware, the servings are big! 

Complimentary chips and salsa and bean dip, mmmmmm. 

Also, they had a mariachi band there, singing for birthdays and just in general. It was loud on a Friday night but also a fun atmosphere, we loved it. (The band takes breaks, don't worry.)

I wish we could have sat closer to the window that overlooks the city but you could still see it from where we were- really incredible real estate!
