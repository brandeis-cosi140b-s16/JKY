Loco recently hosted our holiday party. We had a group of 40+. Like always the atmosphere was fun and exciting. We tend to get a little crazy and this is the perfect place to do that. Want to thank the wait staff for being spot on and attentive to our needs. Thanks Loco Patron  Scottsdale for making our company party one to remember.
