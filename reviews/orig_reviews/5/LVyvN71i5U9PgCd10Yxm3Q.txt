At first I skeptical about this place because of the name, assuming it was another one of those clever scandalous name places with good looking waitresses and not so good food (ie Hooter's). Service could be a little better. We came here before clubbing at Body English since it's located in the Hard Rock Cafe Hotel and Casino too. I was surprised how good it was. Once you walk in they have an authentic Mexican lady making tortillas behind a glass wall (typical Vegas show). They serve fresh, hot chips with 3 very deliciously fresh distinctive salsas. All three are different yet good in their own tastes. I ordered the tostada salad thing. It was the right amount of food before a night of clubbing. The lettuce was fresh, and light, and nothing was overpowering the other. I really, really enjoyed it. The decor and atmosphere is pretty good and fun! I would give this place 4 out of 5 stars because I think my coworkers whom I came here didn't really like what they ordered (taquitos were a bit starchy). Personally I give it a 5! Not a bad place, I'd go back again, if there weren't so many nice places.
