AWESOME.  I went here for lunch, and LOVED the Blue Corn Enchiladas with the shredded beef.  Not your average enchiladas, the blue corn tortillas were stacked and layered with the beef, cheese, and a red sauce that was perfect.  The fried egg on top was surprisingly good, really added to flavor.  My favorite part was the sopapilla- like a light pillow of deliciousness, drizzled with honey.  Oh, the housemade salsa to start with was also amazing.  Waitress was sweet and attentive, and I felt very welcomed, as the owner even stopped by to see how things were going.  I will definitely be back, there were a ton of other things on the menu that I want to try next!
