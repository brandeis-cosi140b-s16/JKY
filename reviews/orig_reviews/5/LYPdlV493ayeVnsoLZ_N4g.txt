Just had lunch there and sat at the bar. Bartender was awesome! The food was outstanding! My first time there and I had the chicken chimichanga......best I have ever had! Great prices too! Manager was awesome too.....made sure everything was great and gave me an appetizer card for their table side guacamole for my next visit! I highly recommend this restaurant!
