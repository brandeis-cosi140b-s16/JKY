I've never had a bad experience here, except for the wait at times when they are busy.  True red and green chile sauce here, which seems surprisingly hard to find in AZ.  If you're from NM and miss the cuisine, this place is a quick and cost-effective spot to get your fix.  My favorite thing here has to be the enchiladas.
