This place is one of those establishments where people have been true to since childhood, me being one of them. Even will see the local celebs in there from time to time, I have personally sat next to jerry calangalo ( ex owner of az sports teams, probably not spelled correctly) and others on a few notes. They have the perfect shredded beef taco, and I also enjoy there red chile burro, so try the combo. The chips are good and come non stop, I love the spicy red sauce that comes with them, it's tasty to douse pretty much everything you get with this sauce. One not so great thing is that they charge you for every soda you drink, I drink ice tea because of this - ice tea = free refils. They have good service and whenever I come across a waitress that is lack luster, they seem to disappear by the time I make it back.  It may seem tacky in there to upscale scottsdale folk but I think it has authentic written all over it. The food will back it up, great place for you and your family, but seriously stop leaving 1 dollar tips for parties over 3, I swear the cheapskates of america frequently go to Pedro's because walking out I have seen everything from 50 cents to one dollar left as a tip. I would suggest for anyone to at least go give this place a try and come open minded. It's real good!
