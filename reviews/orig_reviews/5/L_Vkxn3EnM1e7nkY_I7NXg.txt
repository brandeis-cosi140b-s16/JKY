Impressed on all fronts. A word of warning though: if you don't booze or meat, don't bother. If you like at least one of the two, you'll leave happy.

The decor is clean, hip, sophisticated, and minimalistic with enough of a rustic feel to remind you of the state you're in and the kind of food you're eating. The service was great - I apologized to my waiter for needing my water glass refilled constantly, since I don't tolerate spicy food all that well, and he brought me an extra glass. Nice touch. The menu is roughly half alcohol (remember my warning earlier? I wasn't kidding) but the food items are all appetizing (with, at most, three vegetarian options, so leave your veggie friends at home). Perhaps best of all, the portions are all reasonably-sized (and reasonably priced for the quality), so I was able to share an appetizer and a dessert while having plenty of room for my entree. I had the queso blanco, the crawfish enchiladas, and the triple chocolate brownie - all excellently prepared and fresh-tasting. I got a side of mac and cheese to take home and I have no doubts it will make an awesome dinner tomorrow night. And I really was impressed by everything - in the ladies' room, the trash can was placed next to the door (so you can use your paper towel to open the door instead of your clean hands... for those of you who aren't obsessive about that sort of thing) as well as a hand sanitizer dispenser. The germaphobe in me was overjoyed.

Definitely looking forward to coming back, I hope I can make it in for brunch sometime because the menu looks wonderful.
