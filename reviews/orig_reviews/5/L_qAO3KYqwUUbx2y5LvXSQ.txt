I'm not a big carne asada fan just because they mostly, with the exception of a few places,  all taste the same  so I order tripas and al pastor. Hands down the best al pastor and tripas that I've tried here in Vegas, especially the Al pastor. Tripas have always been my favorite but now I think it's met it's match.  Love the fresh salsa bar.  The mole fries were unique but not a big fan of them. They have a beer bar which I think is amazing. All the meat is cooked and cut right in front of you. All fresh ingredients are used as well as the meat and that's another thing besides the flavor of the food that sets Taco y Taco apart from every other Taco shop. Can't get enough of this place! Now maybe we can get one on the Westside huh?
