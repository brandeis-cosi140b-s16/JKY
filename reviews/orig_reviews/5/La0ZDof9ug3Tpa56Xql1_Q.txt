This review has been a long time coming. Casa Don Juan has been a must visit for me the past couple trips to Vegas thanks to a recommendation from a local friend. Why you might ask would I visit a Mexican restaurant with all the buffet choices available? Simple, as my Hispanic friends will say "I'm an undercover Mexican!" I love Mexican food from birria, menudo, tacos de lengua con todo por favor, bring it on with extra tapatio! Honestly though my real reason for coming here is their camarones a la diabla! I've had my share of camarones a la diabla and I have to say they are one of the best. The spices and seasoning is perfect if you like food extra spicy the way I do. Plus you won't find any packaged mission tortillas here. They are freshly hand made and their guacamole is amazing! As another yelper stated they do take a souvenir photo while you're there which might seem tourisy but my friends and I did not mind. The waiters were friendly and attentive each time I was there so no complaints from me for customer service. In fact they brought me a cup of water even when I didn't ask for it and kept coming by to see if I needed more water thinking the camarones would be too spicy for me. Tsk, Tsk, little do they know this Asian chica loves the heat! My only gripe would probably be the fact that they do not serve jaimaca. I ask for it each time I'm there in hopes that they will finally say yes but not yet. For now their horchata and jugo de pina will do. In any event, if you're looking for a great Mexican food joint slightly off the hustle and bustle of the strip, give Casa Don Juan a try.
