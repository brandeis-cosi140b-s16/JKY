We came in for late night appetizers and drinks. Our reservation was ready sooner than Scheduled. We had the street corn, classic guac , queso fundido all were delish! Everyone had a variety of drinks and everyone loved them. The waiter was very attentive and friendly. They have a dj and the music was kind of loud but didn't bother me!
