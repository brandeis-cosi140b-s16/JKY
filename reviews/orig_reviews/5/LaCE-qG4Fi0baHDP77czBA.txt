I love this place!! All the bartenders were very nice and attentive! The chips and salsa are amazing! They have been playing all the soccer games for the World Cup with the sound! I honestly felt like I was in a sports bar on the beach! Super cool! The margaritas are amazing! And they have a beer called Bottled Blonde which I had never heard of before which was also amazing! I was so impressed with this place that I will most definitely be back!!
