Have to say I was impressed.  Went for Happy Hour and had a couple of street tacos.  Great Value and realy delicious.  This place gives off a vibe of welcome and comfort.  A place to hang out with some friends on a Saturday afternoon.  I will be going back to try their regular tacos and salsas very soon.
