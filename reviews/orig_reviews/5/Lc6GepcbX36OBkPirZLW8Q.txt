The food here is great! Not a big fan of the water flavor and the margaritas but the sangria was very good. Tostaditas were my favorite. Met the chef as well he was very humble and kind. Def recommend the flan it's his family recipe and was the best I have tasted yet! So many flavors! This place def lives up to the hype!
