MMM Everything here is pretty much great as i've tasted almost everything on the menu but what stands out to ME is the Carne Asada Fries. I've tried the carne asada fries at every mexican restaurant there is in Las Vegas, and Tacos El Gordo's Carne Asada Fries have to be at the top. If you haven't tried them, i suggest trying them here and compare. It's inexpensive, a big portion and it tastes amazing.

Will always come back.
