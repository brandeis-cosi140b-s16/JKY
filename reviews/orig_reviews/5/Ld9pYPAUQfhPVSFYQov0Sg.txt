We got: 

Chicken burrito
Meat style burrito but with no meat in it
Shrimp burrito, add black beans and rice

Both the green and red salsas that came with our order were delicious. Perfectly done.

The tortillas were out of this world fresh, fluffy, heavenly. I could eat the tortilla plain and be happy. 

All the burritos were delicious, I tasted them all. The shrimp burrito was what I  ate and I couldn't put it down, I inhaled the whole thing. 

Mexican coke with real sugar in it was the icing on the cake. 

We ordered take out over the phone and they got the order perfect.

I also want to note that although the burritos were very filling, they were not greasy at all, just perfectly cooked like a healthy meal you'd make at home for your family, but they wouldn't know that it's healthy by how amazing they tasted. 

When I was craving burritos earlier in the day, I had never been to this place before, but they tasted exactly like my imaginary burrito tasted. 

I'll definitely be back. The man working in the kitchen was very kind and seems like an awesome  human being.
