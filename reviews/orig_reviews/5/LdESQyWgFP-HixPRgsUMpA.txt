Excellent dining experience. The ceviche was awesome, carne asada dinner was one of the best I've ever had! Very nice service staff, everyone had a smile and kept our drinks and chips full. The gentleman providing the music on the keyboard was very talented. We gave him a $20 tip! It really set the mood for a authentic Mexican dining atmosphere. Whenever I come back to LV, this is a must stop for us!
