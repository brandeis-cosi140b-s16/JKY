What a wonderful dining experience!! Marco was our server and set us up for a great evening. The Cadillac margarita had just the right amount of shots and the cilantro rice and Carne Asada street tacos were EVERYTHING!!! No beers on draft but a good selection nonetheless! We had NO room for dessert but the food was so good that I couldn't resist! So we ended the night with flan....the taste and consistency were second to none. I couldn't wait to actually meet the famous Chef Paco that everyone talks about, as he has created a masterpiece. He, and all of the other team members makes his rounds to all of the patrons and ensures they had a great dining experience. As much as I don't want to make mention of this place because I don't want it to ever be too full when I go (I'm a little selfish),  I couldn't NOT give a review, because they truly deserve all of the success that's to come.
