We started with pitchers of margaritas, chips and salsa and holy guacamole. The guacamole was excellent as were the trio of salsas served with the chips. 

I split the sweet corn tamales as an app as well, which were incredible. The fresh sweet corn kernels were outstanding and the masa was good. 

I was torn as to what I should order. I was feeling like something flavorful but not spicy, which isn't what I normally go for (the not spicy part). So, I ordered the chicken and cheese enchiladas with a tomatillo cream sauce (served with rice and beans). The beans were smokey and not my favorite, but the rice hit the spot as did the enchiladas. The sauce really made the dish for me...I can't pass up tomatillo sauce. 

Our service was quick and so was our food. Our table of seven sat, served and ate in just over an hour. Granted, we were there on a Wednesday night in January, but I would definitely go back again.
