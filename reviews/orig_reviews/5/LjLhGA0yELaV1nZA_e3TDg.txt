My husband I returned to la comida today and ordered the mescalito, yuuum! The bartender recommended the puerco ahumado to share and it was really good. We're light eaters so after the chips and salsa we didn't eat the entire dish.  But it made for a tasty snack later!  I really like this place, good food, friendly staff and nice environment.
