I'm from Texas where we have some of the BEST Tex-Mex restaurants in the USA.   SO, I was skeptical about this place, especially since I have not found a really good Mexican restuarant here in LV.  Well, Cantina Laredo solved that problem because it certainly adds up to the best that Texas has.  The tableside guacamole was absolutely perfect - enchiladas were delicious!!    Their HH has some great prices, and the margs are very good ---- and potent, too!  LOVE IT!!
