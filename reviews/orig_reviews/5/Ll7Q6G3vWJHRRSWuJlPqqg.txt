Oh man, this place is both of the bee's knees. I walked in as a naive gringo and the delightful woman working behind the counter saw my deer in headlights gaze and walked me down yum city. She gave me samples of all the meats, explaining the differences between them. Then once I had sufficiently stuffed myself on sample sized meats, i chose three meats for three tacos and sat underneath the watchful eye of captain luchadore as I had a foodgasm. Absolutely unmatched mexican food. The meat was seasoned perfect. Absolutely perfect. The staff was so friendly, the atmosphere so unique, the food so delicious. I will be taking all my friends here. Thank you!!
