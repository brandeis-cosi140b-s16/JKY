One of the best taco places I've been to.  The lines were long but they move quickly.  There's a selection of different tacos and you get as many as you want. The lingua and the carne asada were my two favorites.  The drinks are cheap but you get unlimited refills.  The condiments bar is fully stocked with sauces and radishes.
