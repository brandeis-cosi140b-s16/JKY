I love this place.  I almost always get take out but the food is fantastic.  I used to live across the street from the one in Mesa so I would walk over there and pick up food at least once a month.  I've had the shrimp tacos, fish tacos, flying saucer, stuffed quesadilla, chicken mole, seafood enchilada and probably a few other things.  All of those things are fantastic but I really love their 3 meat nachos.  It isn't on the menu with all the meats but you can get it that way if you ask.  I personally love their beef but the chicken an pork are great also.  Really one of the most important parts of any mexican food place is the salsa and their salsa is awesome and different from most other places.  They even have a hot salsa that is really good that you can ask for.  Oh, and don't forget the horchata, it is incredible as well.  All in all my favorite mexican restuarant in the valley and I've lived here for 35 years.
