Wow...this place really knocked my socks off.  This is exactly what Phoenix needs, a cool place to eat great Sonoran/Mexican food.  The owners sure had a nice vision and succeded in creating a great spot for the neighborhood.

The tacos and quesadilla I've had here was nothing less than spectacular.  Having lots of flavor and not skimping on the portions. The salsa bar is quite fun as well with many different and uniques choices to choose from.  Never seen so many salsas offered anywhere else and I'm sure I will make it through all of them with my many visits to follow.

Keeping the flavor of the area being on the edge of a very artsy neighborhood the decor is amazing.  Vibrant paintings all around and murals on the bathroom doors definitely makes this place stand out with style.

This place is a must see for anyone who likes great food and culture.  Take a deep breath before you walk in and inhale an experience I am sure you will remember.
