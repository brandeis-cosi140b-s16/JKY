This Mexican place to eat is on the strip at the top. Its close to Encore hotel. 

Tried the Spicy pork and Asada tacos, and Asada Quesdadilla. They were all delicious! Best taco and quesadilla I've ever had! Very fresh and flavorful. We even ordered to-go for later late night munchies.

Fast service and inexpensive. You order first and then go to the cashier to pay.
