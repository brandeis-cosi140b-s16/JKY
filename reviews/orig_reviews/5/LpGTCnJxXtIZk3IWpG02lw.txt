BEST TACOS EVER!

Gourmet tacos are fantastic but these are the best of the best.  The al pastor tacos as well as the al pastor quesa are amazing.  The pork is marinated and has great flavor, the inclusion of pineapple adds sweetness which works great with the savory flavor of the pork.  My personal favorite is the chicken mole which is not for everyone but I love it.  The mole sauce has great depth of flavor.  It is made from unsweetend cocoa and chiles.  Unusual but delicious!  

The salsa bar has a great selection.  I recommend the chipotle salsa with its smoky flavor.  The tomotillo and guacamole are excellent.
