There's not many 5 star places in the valley. LOS DOS MOLINOS is one of them!! The ambience, menu and staff are all authentic. The food / menu is served New Mexico style which is all good... The Chicken Enchilada dinner is hands down the best plate of food West of the Mississippi. I've almost sold my future first born for a plate... Yea, it's that serious. 

You will not be disappointed with the chips and salsa. You will not be disappointed by the service. I will personally refund your money if you're not satisfied with the food you get. That's how much I'm confident you'll love this place. Every date I've taken here or every homie that's come with me to eat here has vouched for this place as well. 

Thanks to a lovely angel named Noemi who first took me here, I can vouch for it as well.
