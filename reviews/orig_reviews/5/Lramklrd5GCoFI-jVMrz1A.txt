I'm lucky enough to live a block away from Scottsdale's Best Mexican food! I eat here quite often (1-3 times/month)... So I consider myself a TJ's pro! 

First of all- The Salsa Bar
Two thumbs up! The SALSA VERDE IS THE BEST ever, and you can take as much home as you want! The Salsa Bar also has fresh cut limes and radishes, as well as a SPICY RED SALSA and various other toppings. 

2nd- Main Course 
I love tacos- who doesn't? 
The carne is seasoned perfectly, and served on double stacked corn tortillas- topped with fresh chopped onion and cilantro. This is my personal favorite way to eat carne asada.

I have also tried the al pastor, spicy shrimp, and chicken tacos- all of them were also delicious. 

Oh! THE ROLLED TACOS 
Try them!! 
(I order them w/o tomatoes...) They come loaded with guac and sour cream, rice and beans.

3rd- RICE & BEANS 
YUM! Try these. Just because you won't regret it!
