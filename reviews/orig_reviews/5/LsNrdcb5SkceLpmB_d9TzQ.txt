First of all I hate comments from people who have no clue about the restaurant business. Don't go out to eat if you are in a hurry.

Sitting and the ambiance is great. Large place with a ton of seating. I am not eating here but I'm drinking here. The cucumber Serrano is great. My wife is drinking agua fresca with vodka and its great. I will update the post when I eat here.
