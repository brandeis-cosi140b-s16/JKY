I love Mexican food and this place has become one of my favorites. They use a mesquite grill to cook the food and it provides great flavor to the meat. They also make fresh salsa everyday and offer it at a self serve station. The owner and staff are super friendly and the food comes out fast. The food has never disappointed us whenever we came here and I  highly recommend this place if you haven't tried it.
