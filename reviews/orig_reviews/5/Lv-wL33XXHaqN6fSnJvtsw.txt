We've had lunch here several times, I remember being skeptical the first time setting foot here, but was very pleasantly suprised.  Service is very good, and the food is fabulous for such reasonable prices.

One bit of advice, if  you sit outside, they have some overhead heaters that radiate warm heat downwards.  Maybe it's okay on a super cold day, but I didn't like it.  Not all the tables have the heater, just ask to be moved if it bothers you (which they did no problem).

They also have some nice souveniers at the entrance.
