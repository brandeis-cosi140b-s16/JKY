This place is amazing! I had the carne asada tacos with rice and beans and I could not have been happier. 
At first I thought the place was a little expensive but after seeing the size of the tacos I thought the prices were fitting. Packed with meat and guacamole, I did not want them to end, lol and the beans were the bomb!
