The tacos are amazing and small enough to try a few different ones and not break the bank. They do a great job pairing food items. 
The place does tend to get loud. Speaking of loud. Not sure if it's a new thing or I just don't go later on Saturday nights but what the heck was up with the Techno dance music?!? We ended up sitting outside because the music was so loud and not a good mesh with dinning. I wasn't sure if I should get out my glow sticks or not. Stick to being an amazing restaurant not a rave. = )
