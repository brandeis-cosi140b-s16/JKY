So I really like this place...Went on a Saturday hmmm around 1pm and It was nice and hot out this place looked like so much fun...it was packed they had missters ...so we decided to have lunch there and we had a blast people watching staying cool with the mist and enjoying a nice lunch with cocconut margaritas on  a beautiful day...the server was nice and very helpful when asking questions about good drinks...so yea on our next vegas trip were def. going here again:)
