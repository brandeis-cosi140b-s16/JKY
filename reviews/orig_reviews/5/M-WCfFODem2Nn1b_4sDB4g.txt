Chips, salsa, and bean dip right on the house off the rip to start?! What! Snuck in a little after 6pm and still got the happy hour price on the margarita's?! Damn who still does that. Had a regular and mango margarita. Margarita craving fixed. 

Got the guac as an app. A must. They mash it up table side, so you pick the ingredients. No onions for me. I had the chicken taco, tosdada,and enchilada combo joint. Wow! My girl had the bean burrito and beef taco combo. Said she liked it (Was her pick to eat here since she said it was the best). Tons of stuff on the menu. All this for $55 and my girl had 2 margarita's too. Definitely good.  

The only complaint is that the decor is a little old, but I like the mom and pop hole in the wall type places. I also ate wayyyy too much and it felt like a rock was in my stomach all night.
