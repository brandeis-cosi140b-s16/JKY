Oh hey there awesome music venue. You host amazing local and big time artists on top of serving ridiculously good food?! Yeah, I'm gonna be a regular. 

This place is the best thing to happen to downtown Phoenix since....I don't know, the invention of misters. Seriously, if you enjoy live music, great people, and delicious food, then this is the place for you. I love the diversity in musicians that they are able to book and their friggin tortas are out of this world. Not to mention, the rice pudding is the best I've ever had - and I'm a Latin woman who loves rice pudding. So please don't take this lightly. This. Is. The. Bomb. Rice. Pudding. 

I love it here. I bring all of my out of town friends here. And I hope this never closes down because if it does, I'm moving.
