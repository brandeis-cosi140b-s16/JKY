The food was great they're open 24/7 you even could order online. I had order chile relleno plate comes with beans and rice, another plate was fajitas and carne asada plate and enchiladas swissas means swiss cheese it was delicious. Also before you eat they give two type of sauce hot and mild and aside bean dip very good and their aguas frescas Jamaica y horchata very good
