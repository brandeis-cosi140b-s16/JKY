First thing is first, do not come here with a hangover.
While the food will definitely satisfy and cure the hangover, the loud music will not.

Service:
For as busy as it was, especially on a post-vegas weekend Sunday, me and my party of five were quickly seated and orders were taken. We had our main server and then greeted and noticed by other ones too. The wait was 15 minutes or less. The staff was so friendly, and very attentive.

Food:
I ordered the Tacos de Pescado (fish tacos).
Not only did they NOT rob you on your 'fish' part of the tacos, it was the perfectly prepared. Topped off my tacos with their red salsa which is delicious, not too spicy!
Definitely a MUST-HAVE!

Environment:
If you love mariachis music and bright colorfulness, then definitely come here.
And since you're close to the people around you I do not recommend if you don't like people and loud music.
