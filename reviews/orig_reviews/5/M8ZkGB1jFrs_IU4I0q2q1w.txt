Came here when I was in town for the Chargers game. SO DAMN GOOD!! We told them we had never been there and let us sample everything.....EVERYTHING! I ended up getting a burrito with Al Pastor, but it was so hard to decide. Everything tasted so good. Be sure to get a churro before you leave, they fry it fresh. Nothing beats this place. Next time I'm in town, this will be my first stop.
