What is Gadzooks trying to do? Make a better restaurant than Chipoltle? Well they succeeded! And that is no easy task. 
I love Gadzooks! The fresh and different ingredients. The corn or flour tortillas uniquely Gadzooks. Tacos just as good as the enchiladas. And freshly melted cheese in the oven. I feel sorry for employees having to constantly stick their arms in a super hot oven but my stomach thanks you! I could go on and on about the incredible tacos and enchiladas, but I just have two words...tortilla soup! I get it every time and it's super bueno! Took my wife to Gadzooks for the first time on her day off and impressed the heck out of her! Happy wife equals a happy husband! 
The Decor is spiffy too. Really nice illustration on the wall of a giant enchilada that actually helps explain their ingredients. It's these little well thought out details that makes The Gadzooks name synonymous with quality!
