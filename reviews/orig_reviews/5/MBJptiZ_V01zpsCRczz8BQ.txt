When you move away from the town you grew up in, you inevitably have a favorite food that you can't find in your new city.   I miss the hell out of Someburro's shredded beef chimichangas.  Fried crispy shell, slightly spicy red sauce, juicy shredded beef, and cool sour cream is my perfect meal.  I don't need any beans or rice to take up space in my stomach; I need all the stomach room I can find because the chimichanga is huge.    I was recently back in AZ and the first place I went to eat was the Someburro's that is down the street from where I grew up.   I was instantly put into a state of bliss with my first bite; it was just as good as I had built it up in my head.   Sure I was stuffed after I was done, but I had to finish it since I only get one every couple of years. Thank you Someburro's for being consistently good all of these years!
