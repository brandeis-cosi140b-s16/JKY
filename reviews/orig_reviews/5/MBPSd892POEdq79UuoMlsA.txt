The food is amazing. If there is any wait as a few people have mentioned, it is well worth it. The very limited bad reviews seem to come from those people who complain about everything. You've all been out with them before and it always proves to be awkward because they find some insignificant thing to complain about. 

Please go here and support local small businesses. The tall guy everyone talks about in reviews said he and one of the cooks started the place and run it everyday. It's authentic and delicious.
