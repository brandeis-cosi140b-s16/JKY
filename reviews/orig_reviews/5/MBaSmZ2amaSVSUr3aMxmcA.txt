This has become my favorite Mexican restaurant. I feel like they understand what Mexican food is from all the different parts of Mexico. It's not just Tex-Mex but it has mixes of Baja flavors as well.

The staff was awesome and it was an enjoyable evening!! Can't wait to go there once again.

UPDATE: 1/23/2010 - My Partner and I went there last night for our 10 year anniversary. The staff was just as warm and as engaging as ever. Well, we spent a lot of money at the bar, just the two of us, and then bought a nice bottle of wine. We had an awesome dinner and the staff went out of their way to make sure that we had the perfect table & evening of our lives. THIS IS THE BEST RESTAURANT IN CHARLOTTE, NC!! YOU MUST TRY THEM NOW AND TELL THEM Jake and Barrie sent ya!! Ask for Heather!
