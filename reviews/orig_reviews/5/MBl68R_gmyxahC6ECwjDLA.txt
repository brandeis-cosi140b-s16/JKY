I love Gecko Grill.  I have been coming here since they were in their other location.  The special Chimi (beef) is the best.    I miss their beef tri tips, but maybe we will see them again.  The staff is nice.  Food has always been awesome.  

Love this place.  Here is what you need to remember:  Beef special chimi, all you can eat chips and GREEN salsa.  Yum!
