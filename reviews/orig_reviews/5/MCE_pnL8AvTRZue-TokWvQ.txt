We love this place!!!!  When out of towners come to visit it is where we go.  We have never had a meal that wasn't great.  The atmosphere is fun and great for our two kids.  I usually get the salmon and I love it, so much so that I can't get myself to try anything else.  My husband enjoys eating and like to try a different dish each time, always happy with his meal.  Our out of towners now look forward to eating there when they come to visit.  We have always had good friendly and attentative service.
I highly recommend this place.
