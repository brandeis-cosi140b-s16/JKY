Drove past this place a few times and finally decided to check it out.   Great outdoor patio that is enclosed during the day and misters kept it cool. Then they opened them at sunset which was cool.   Started with the guacamole plus pomegranate which was recommended by our waitress Jennifer.  We actually went with her other suggestions as well on the menu.  The Korean beef tacos were yummy.  The aroz con pato was muy excelente! 
The extra special for me was an awesome grapefruit beer.   Yep,  read that again.  Grapefruit.   Very very good brew. 
This would be a good date place and if I was single I have a feeling this would be a good happy hour spot as well.
