DAMN these were some tasty tacos!!!! My buddy and I were extremely hungover while visiting Vegas and we kept on hearing about Tacos El Gordo. So we decided to take a walk to find this gem.and it was well worth it. At $2 a taco its a steal. The pastor and carne asada are bomb.com and I highly suggest checking them out for yourselves. They even have whipped juices in which they taste like a familiar chain drinks orange whipped juice w/ banana..... that is all. Enjoy!!!
