Best mexican food in the valley. This place is literally a hole in the wall gem.  It looks sketchy on the outside, but if you stop to smell the aroma in the parking lot you can't resist heading in.  The food is authentic, fresh and made to order. The tortillas are to die for:) After eating here, I can't in good conscience go to Serranos or Filibertos again!
