Great food. VERY Cheap! Maybe too cheap.  I Don't Like THE Extremely Loud russian music Sometimes,   a beautifully cooked dinner and  edm don't believe they mix.  But other than that  Exquisitely simple Russian food, well executed for a fairly new restaurant,   great friendly staff and I believe I will be coming back VERY often :)   try; stuffed cabage , beef stroganoff,  chicken kabob, &rib eye  with potatoes ,
