WOW!!!!!!!! I am FURIOUS with myself that I have just NOW made it here. To call Rokerij a hidden gem is an understatement. One of the coolest places I've been in my life.
It is cozy, intimate and sexy. You're at the top of your game if you bring a date here-you will wow them and they'll think you're the bomb (if they haven't been here). It's also a great place to just chill with a small group of friends. 
You nostrils will be tempted with the smell of a cozy fire and mouthwatering dishes before you even get throught the door. The upstairs dining room surrounds an open kitchen. Low lighting and a roraring fire-HELLO...need I say more?
I highly recommend the downstairs cellar which has a long copper-top bar, along with a few tables-there is also a little cozyy nook/booth-PERFECT place to get a little romance on.
The food is outstanding-I highly recommend the 3-plate/$25 offering. The portions are generous-plenty for two people to share.
The bartenders downstairs are AWESOME and are always ready to make an enthusiastic recommendation if you can't decide. The music played downstairs is awesome too. EVERYTHING about this place is a awesome. My first night here was nothing short of PERFECT!!!!
