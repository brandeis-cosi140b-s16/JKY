I'm so glad Bakersfield has finally moved in! The space is beautifully designed with a great wraparound bar as the centerpiece. Nearly every spot at the bar has coat/ purse hooks AND individual outlets (woot woot!). There are benches at the front of the restaurant for groups and booths on both sides of the bar.

Drinks: I highly recommend starting with the house margarita. It's the perfect combo of tart, sweet, and salty. And it's served in a mason jar.

Food: The queso is very good. We've gotten it plain each time, but I'm trying it with beans and/or chorizo on my next visit. The tostadas are larger than I was expecting and flavorful, but kind of awkward to eat. If you're on a first date and trying to look cute while eating, they probably aren't the way to go. The tacos are also delish. We've had the mole, rojo, fish, short rib, and cochinitas. The fish was the only one we didn't love. It was a tad too frozen fish sticky for my taste.

Service: They're attentive, friendly, and go above and beyond to make you happy. I've only been a few times, but our previous servers have recognized me on each of our visits and stopped by to say hi.

Reservations: Make 'em now! If you don't have a res, they'll call you when your table is ready.

Hopes & dreams: I hope they put the game on those awesome TVs on game days. It'd be a great spot for football watching. Also, I'd love to see them expand to weekend brunch service (pretty please??).
