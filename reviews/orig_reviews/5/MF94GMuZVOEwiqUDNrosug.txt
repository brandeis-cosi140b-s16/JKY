The food was fantastic!!!  Really, I don't know what more I can say.  I ordered fish tacos--huge meaty pieces of fish in tiny little tortillas.  So good!!  We ordered a bottle of homemade sangria.  It was only $20, and was enough for four full glasses and refills!!  I love the fact that it's right on the edge of the gondola river running throughout the Grand Canal Shoppes.  The end of the river is right at the restaurant so all the gondoliers would pause to serenade their riders and the crowd.  I think people at the restaurant should be given point cards so we can rate the singing.  It's sad, but some of the gondoliers shouldn't sing.  Others were so amazing that their voices echoed off the walls!!
