So is it awkward that I may have fallen in love with a 50 year old hispanic lady named Selena?

You wouldn't think so if you met her and tasted her food at Mesquite Grill. I went there for lunch today after seeing it on Yelp's hottest restaurants and was very impressed. 

When I arrived it was empty so that is never a good sign. But Selena put my worries behind me. She recommended the combo platter which consisted of a carne asada taco, chicken taco, beans and rice. The tacos were out of this world. They weren't your typical street style tacos; they are so big they are almost like mini burritos. The rice and beans were good but nothing out of this world. 

Selena makes all the food fresh in the back and you can tell. If you are deciding between the Chipotle just across the parking lot or Sonora Mesquite...there is no question go say hi to Selena.
