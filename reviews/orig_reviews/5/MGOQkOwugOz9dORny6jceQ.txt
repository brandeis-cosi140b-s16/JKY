I am staying at the Mandalay Bay for 4days and ate here 3 times. Service is excellent, lamb tacos from the daily special were excellent. Guacamole and the salad it comes with are excellent. Ceviche was excellent but you should be a fish fan, one of them has a fishy smell. Cocktails were tasty and good pours.
