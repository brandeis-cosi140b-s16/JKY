An excellent spot to go for real New Mexican food.  It's a small place with a nice local restaurant feel.  The red and green chile is awesome, and they roast their own green chile when they are in season.  I recommend anything on the menu as it pretty much rocks!  Their sopapillas are very tasty, but a little heavier than I might have liked.  Still the prices are inexpensive and for New Mexican fare, it beats the pants off the other places you might go.
