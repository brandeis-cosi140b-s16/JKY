I love Chino Bandito for takeout. I wouldn't want to eat there, but I like taking the blazing tin trough of goodness home to unwrap and savor it! My favorite is the Jade Chicken, alone or as a quesadilla. The jerk chicken is my other go-to selection but the egg fu young is another good option. JD likes the hengrenade chicken, barbequed pork,  the carnitas and the machaca all in quesadillas. 
I think the jerk fried rice is delicious and usually try to steal some of JD's since he gets double rice and no beans. I have to go with the black beans, even though their consistency reminds me of hot road tar. They taste kind of sweet. Add some of CB's homemade salsa and its a tantalizing side dish that compliments a really good takeout meal. The cookies arent bad either. Two combo meals with tax adds up to $17.33. Super cheap for the amout of food you get.
