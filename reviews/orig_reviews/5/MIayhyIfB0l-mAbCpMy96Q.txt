I've been here three times and held back writing a review the first time only because I saw many subpar reviews. But after my third visit, I have to write about this place because they deserve it. Toros has some great food but it really depends on what you order! There are definitely dishes that are a HIT or a miss. After looking at the menu for a few moments, our server returned quickly and asked us if we wanted to put in our order early. She said there was a party of 15 that has been seated but wanted to put our order in first so we wouldn't need to wait so long. Wow! Now that is some great service.

The interior is pretty cool and doesn't look too much like a restaurant or a bar, but a neat combination of the two.

While you're waiting they serve you chips and salsa. The chips have that authentic, home-made crunch and taste. I'm pretty sure they make it in the restaurant and are terrific.

The carna asada tacos are to die for. Not only do they taste amazing, they are like $2.50 each. 3-4 of these and you'll be pretty filled. DON'T get the fish tacos because they were less than stellar. If you want seafood then get the shrimp tacos.

I ordered the carne asada bowl and for the price you get a pretty big bowl. The ingredients taste really fresh and appetizing. The best part is all the food came out in less than 10 minutes. Not only was the service great but speedy.

For two people the bill only came out to $18 and I was stunned because it felt like we ate a meal worth twice that. Since moving to the Summerlin area, this is the first place I talk about when people ask me about dining. I've been here three times and they have exceeded my expectations each time I've been. Will definitely recommend!
