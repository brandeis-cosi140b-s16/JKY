I eat at Gallo Blanco regularly and recently tried Otro. 

Customer service was impeccable and the food was incredible, as usual. 

The guac and chips here are different than Gallo. The guac is more spicy. I actually prefer it over Gallo. 

Excellent burritos and enchiladas. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. And I love that they get their in house coffee from Lux. 

The owner, Doug, is an awesome guy and made for a pleasant experience when we went. 

Definitely a staple!
