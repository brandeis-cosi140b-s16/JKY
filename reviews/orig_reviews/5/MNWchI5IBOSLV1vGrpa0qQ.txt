Recommended by our hotel, we were greeted by the valet who was kind and helpful.

We walked into a dark yet inviting restaurant where the staff was friendly and attentive.

We ordered chicken enchilada, filet in a chile relleno, and scallops.  Very good but a tad spicy for one of us.

Tip: guacamole is awesome!
