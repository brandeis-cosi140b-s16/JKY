Tried some new things on my latest visit that should definitely be on your radar:
1. Guacamole - of course
2. Queso - probably made with some beer in it and it had beans which was a yummy surprise
3. Tortilla soup - this thing blew me away. It was full of delicious-ness
4. Churros - I'm still dreaming about these things.
5. Flan - I am not a fan of flan, but I could see why all 15 people at our table were going nuts over this stuff. It is better than the rest.
