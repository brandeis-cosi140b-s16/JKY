Hands down my favorite mexican place of all time! Big cheesy chimis, huge burritos and tacos with the tastiest mexican fillings. My favorite is the Mayan Cochinita Pibil, so good Johnny Depp would've shot him dead in Once Upon a Time in Mexico! haha Seriously so good, plus they give you chips with endless salsa! My secret is to mix the spicy green salsa with the creamy cilantro! I love this restaurant so much I would marry it! lol
