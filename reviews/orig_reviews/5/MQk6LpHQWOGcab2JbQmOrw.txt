This was the best food I have ever had.

We ordered a lot of bulgogi. Bulgogi fries, bulgogi burrito, bulgogi chimichanga, and a two meat bulgogi plate.
We only ordered half orders, but there was so much food we had to get to go containers.

And the wait staff was super friendly. He was smiling the entire time and quick to notice if we needed anything.

I am definitely coming back.
