We came here on December 23rd, after failing to find a local kebab store that was open.  I remembered the amazing mosaic sculpture and told my buddy, let's try the place with the big Dia de los Muertos lady on the front....and we did.  The Mayan taco was ....well...to use the term orgasmic would be both an understatement and a poor use of the word.  I took my parents there 4 days later and had a similar experience. My dream dinner there is to have many friends, many hours, many many tacos, and many beers or margaritas.  I am impressed with the food quality, but haven't had the beans or rice, I figure why?  They have tacos.  Also, impressive salsa bar with a pink radish salsa that I wanted to drink out of the bowl.  Yes, this is a hedonistic review, but I had a hedonistic time.  Go eat here.  They must never go out of business.
