Even with the $50 dining credit offered, I would have paid full price for this meal. It was so flavorful and something quite like nothing I have ever had ! I thought for sure the enchiladas wouldn't fill me up w/out rice or beans but I was wrong. 1 enchilada in and I was ready to burst. It may have been the hot chips and awesome salsa but either way those enchiladas were amazing ! Handmade thick corn tortillas stuffed with shredded, smoked chicken breast then covered in green salsa and cheese and this to DIE FOR corn, mushroom, raja mix. 
I will definitley be back and definitley try another dish. 
Job well done Susan!
