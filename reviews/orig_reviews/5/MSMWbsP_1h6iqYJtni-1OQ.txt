Went here on a recommendation from a local Las Vegan, and it was so great! We are in town for just a week and looking for stuff to do off the strip that's more Las Vegas local style and less expensive. This place was a great find!

The food came out so quick! Salsa chips and guacamole were included free. Got the special and it was so great and made so quickly but high quality. 

Definitely recommend if you are in the area, looking for a quick, delicious and cheap bite
