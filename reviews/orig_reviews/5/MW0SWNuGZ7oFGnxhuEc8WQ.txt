My husband and I love this place. This place has authentic Mexican food. The ceviche was awesome. It is hard to find good ceviche and this place had it. The service was great and everyone was very friendly. The atmosphere was very nice and clean. The manager even stopped by to chat with us. For me to visit Cave creek for the first time this place made my visit even better. Definitely going to come back. Our drive from gilbert was so worth it..
