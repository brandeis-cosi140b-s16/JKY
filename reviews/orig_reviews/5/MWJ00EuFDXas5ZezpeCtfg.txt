The best Mexican food I've had in Arizona. Rice and beans must be homemade. I never rant about rice and beans..I had the cheese enchiladas and a chile relleno. Both were outstanding. Salsa was great too. 
We had great service too. We drove by this place a bunch of times over the years. Kept saying "we should try that place". We are definitely going back. Also couldn't finish it all, so we both got 2 meals out of it. You should try this place..
