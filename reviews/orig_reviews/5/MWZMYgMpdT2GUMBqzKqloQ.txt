$4.99 -3 mix and match tacos!

I VERY much enjoyed how these tacos! I tried the Shrimp, Fish, and Potatoe tacos- ALL DELICIOUS but specifically the fish and potatoe tacos. 

The fish taco is made with grilled talapia (not fried or battered like most baja fish tacos). The tacos come with a HUGE load of the basic mix of pico de gallo, cabbage/lettuce, onion, and QUESO fresco which I absolutely LOVE! I mean really, they are loaded. They use the small local brought YELLOW corn tortillas- which held very well!! (The cook would not tell me the brand for some reason :( )

Did I mention a fantasitc array of HOT SAUCES available at the counter to add to the already delicious tacos?? I recommmend using BLUE WARES hot sauce with the shrimp tacos- it's a great taste! 

The cook threw in their own house sauce which had a blended baja flavor- not bad at all! Note: the house sauce is SPICY FOR THE WIMPS and JUST RIGHT FOR THE PROS!! :D

On top of that, the owner and cook were very polite and more than happy to help me out with the menu on my first visit here. This joint is located right next to UNLV, it's small, and not at all fancy. The have a bar, cheap beer, and happy hour (Mon & Tues starting at 2pm) during the week also!
