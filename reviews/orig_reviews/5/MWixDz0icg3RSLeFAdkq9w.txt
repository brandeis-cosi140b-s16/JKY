Ay Caramba!!! Love this little hidden place!!! Love the sangrias, especially for happy hour. The guacamole is yum! and the tortas!! ohh the tortas!!! Highly recommended. Try them all!! The elote for appetizer is DELICIOSO too!  On Wednesday nights they have a Flamenco show and it is lovely!!! It's like taking a little break from the routine and just experience something different. Every time someone from Miami or Ecuador comes to visit me in AZ, I take them there so they can experience something nice and it won't break my budget. =)  Warning: Be careful with those sangrias, either I am very light weight or those 3 sangrias were too strong, 'cause I was out !!! =) OLE!
