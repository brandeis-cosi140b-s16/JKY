Freaking EXCELLENT, authentic food for an unbeatable cost. Plus, it's served so quickly that I might even consider it fast food, except that it's way too fresh to even receive that label.  The people that work there are all really nice, and since it's a grocery store it's nice because I can pick out a drink from their large selection to compliment the meal.  Also, the selection of toppings/sauces really takes the tacos to an entirely new level.  Basically lived off of this place over the summer.
