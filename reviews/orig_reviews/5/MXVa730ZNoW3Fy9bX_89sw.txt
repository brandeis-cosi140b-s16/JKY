We were taken aback by the decor, waitstaff, the patrons, and classic rock playing, because it appeared filled with hipsters,  an all male staff, and an interior with a very confused identity.   HOWEVER, I will be returning, and I will tell you why.....
       1. Salsa bar, simply delicious.  All of them. From mild, to smoky, to hot, there's a peanut and pecan salsa, jicama, guacamole, Pico de gallo, and several more. 
       2. Great menu choices, not your typical American/Mexican options.  
       3. The street tacos! !! We chose Al Pastor,  Carne Asada, y Cochinita Pibil with rice and beans. Uhhhhh-mazing!  

From a white girl who used to never eat Mexican, who is now married to a Mexican.....
I was totally impressed. My husband said 4 stars, because he's got a picky palette. 
Thoroughly enjoyed my meal! Can't wait to return for a Horchata, and to try the Mole!
