My son and I just had lunch. It was fabulous. I've been there probably 10 times now. The food is great (5 stars on the food). Occasionally in the past the service was a bit slow, but today the waiter on it. The chef came up, asked about our food and spent about 5 minutes discussing other items on the menu. I took out of town friends there last year and they flipped out. Check it out people!
