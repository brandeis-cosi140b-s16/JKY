My wife and I found this on yelp driving through Phoenix. So glad we did! These are some of the best stinking tacos I've had. The variety of meats offered is quite the spread. We let the owner, who is the nicest lady ever as well as her daughter, know it was our first time and they let us sample the meats. Sample the meat!! Every single one tasted like heaven and we loved it. Every time I drive through Phoenix I will definitely be coming here. I pleaded with them to open up one in my home town.
We got the 5 small tacos each with various meats. So amazing! We loved it so much we got burritos to go for dinner. Best taco shop I've ever had.
