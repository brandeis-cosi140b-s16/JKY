There are few restaurants that one encounters in their lifetime that achieve a perfect balance of price, atmosphere, and quality of food. Santos is one of those Giants.

The veggie tacos were probably the best tacos I've ever had, and the service was fast and friendly. Stop reading this and go eat their tacos, bye
