Love this place! I've been here many many times... It's very authentic. All the servers are mexican.. I like that. It seems family owned.. There's no bar, just beer and wine and I think they have liquor but they make it in the back. They have nice spicy sauces. The habanero is SUPER hot, I like the tomatillo.
