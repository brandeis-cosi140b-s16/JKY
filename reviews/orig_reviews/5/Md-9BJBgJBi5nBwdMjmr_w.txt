After a long day of walking the VEGAS strip and taking pics like a tourist we were hungry and craving Mexican food. We had heard that Javiers was a good place to eat at, according to the reviews I saw on yelp. Our server Angel was great! The service was excellent the food was amazing! I had the the steak fajitas my gf had enchiladas. She had a drink and I had a nice cold beer. The drinks were good and the environment made us want to back next time we're in Vegas. Highly recommended this place for Mexican food.
