Stumbled across this place by accident this morning. Could not have been a better meal. The tacos were outstanding, the chill relleno was amazing. Carlos and Angel provided top notch service from the second we walked in the door. If you're a local and haven't been here you're missing out. If you're visiting the area like we are, you'd be missing the best Vegas has to offer. Definitely a place we'll be coming back to time and time again.
