Most definitely one of the best if not the best tacos I have ever had. I got their lengua, cabeza, and carne asada tacos and I have to tell you... it is amazing. I really have nothing else to say. There are so many words that describe the greatness of this place but... I just can't. Speechless. 

PRO TIP: The wait is pretty long so definitely expect a long line... Come with 3 or more people so that you guys can wait in the 3 separate lines. There are three different lines (stations) with different meats so if you come with more people, you guys can wait in separate lines and get more variety. That's pretty much all you have to know. NOW GO!
