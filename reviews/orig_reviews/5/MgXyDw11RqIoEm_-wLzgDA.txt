Mmmm, just thinking about Los Dos makes my mouth water. If you like it hot, hot, hot, this is the place for you!

True, it's strangely located in a dumpy Mesa industrial building and true, the food is not for the faint of heart (or faint of taste buds). But, the enchilada-style green chile burros here are among the BEST this native Arizona gal has ever tasted. Try one with a dollop of sour cream to cool the burn!

Service can be a little sketchy - the last time I was there, our server was a Mexican with a NY deli attitude, if you can imagine that. But don't let that stop you from experiencing an Arizona original.
