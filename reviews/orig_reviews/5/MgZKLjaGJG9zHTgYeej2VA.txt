I've been here numerous times, but this last time helped me decide on this being a 5 stars.

Ordered:  
Freshly made Guacamole
Authentic Plancha Fajitas (see overall section for details)

Pros:
* Atmosphere:  Every time I come here, I admire the interior design and landscaping
* Spacious/Comfy booths:  Over-sized booths that can accommodate larger parties
* Guacamole:  I'm a fan of Guac and I've gotta admit that this place has killer Guac

Cons:
* Lunch Menu was pretty much the same as the dinner aside from price of  the tacos

Overall:
I really like this place.  Inspiring architecture partnered with some good food and service is a win!  Jade and I ordered the Fajitas which are meant to be shared.  There is an option of meat and we asked if it was possible to combine two different meats (which Agave happily accommodated).  We chose the grilled Filet Mignon & Tequila marinated Rock Shrimp.  It was served with a side of spanish rice, 3 warm tortillas (each),Pinto beans, Guacamole, Escrema, and Salsa.  The Filet Mignon/shrimp combo came out on a sizzling platter.  It was a towering portion and I felt as if could have been shared among 4 friends with no problem.  It was incredible, especially the shrimp!  They shrimp themselves were huge and so full of flavor!  I definitely recommend this for people looking to share.  Guacamole (as mentioned earlier) is also highly recommended!  We went this past Friday during lunch hour and there was no wait.  

Tips:
* If you're a fan of Margaritas, Agave was a wide variety to choose from.
* If you are dining in the evening, there is an outdoor patio (too hot for the day)
* The restaurant sits behind Islands restaurant
* It can be a good place for a date and/or a drink =)
