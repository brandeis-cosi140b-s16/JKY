Just went to the Buffalo location (have been to the Decatur location numerous times) because they're open on Sunday. It was so good, as expected. The waitress (who also works at the other location) was super friendly and on top of drinks. This location is bigger, seems cleaner, and was so speedy! Will definitely be back --- I love both locations!
