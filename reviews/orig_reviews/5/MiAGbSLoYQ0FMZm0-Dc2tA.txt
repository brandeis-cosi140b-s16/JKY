I won't rave on and on as you have probably already read everything that I am going to say. This place is awesome! The french toast, sausage, and (drum roll please)the carne adovada are among my favorite dishes. The bloody marys are great too! They actually come with a side of beer. This place is hard to find. Just look for the hardware store in the the plaza and it will be directly to the left of it, and to the right of Luci's!!!
