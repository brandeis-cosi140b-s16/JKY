I met a group of friends at El Encanto for dinner and it was a lovely evening.  I enjoyed the ride up (about 30 minutes for me), you leave the hustle and bustle of Scottsdale and just drive.  It was late afternoon so the sun was kind of low.  

El Encanto is rather large with an indoor and outdoor seating area.  My friends were already there when I arrived but I sat down and ordered a drink that was not only very good, but on the table within two minutes.  I chose the cheese enchiladas, which were really really good.  They stuff them full of cheese and onions, which I find is rare.  Most places use a meager amount of cheese but these were oozing (in fact there was cheese over everything on my plate! Yum!) and were drowning in enchilada sauce.  Just the way I like them!  Everyone enjoyed their meals which included shrimp tacos and a bean burrito.  

I will definitely be returning with my husband.  I enjoyed the atmosphere outside, the service was quick (we were only there an hour) and the food was fantastic.
