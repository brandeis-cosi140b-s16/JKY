If I could eat here everyday, I would be so happy! Where to even begin?

Every time I come here, I always start with a Blackberry Margarita. Ingredients are so fresh with a great kick of tequila. Their chips comes with three types of salsa - mild, verse and hot (the hot is habanero so take little dips on that one) as well as beans. You could snack on those for hours!

Now to the fun part, the entrees. I HIGHLY recommend the Carne Asada Burrito. Seriously, it will give you life! It's packed with amazing steak, rice, black beans and guac, all rolled up in a beautiful tortilla. It also comes with a side of cilantro rice. I'm not a huge fan of cilantro but it was definitely good.

I have also tried their street-style tacos and their fajitas are huge. All made with the freshest ingredients!

Make sure to say hello to Chef Paco as he likes to make his rounds and say hello to his guests.

Seriously, one of the best places in Vegas - hands down! :)
