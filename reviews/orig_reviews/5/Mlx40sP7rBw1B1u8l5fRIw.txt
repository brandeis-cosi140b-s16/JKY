A great find in Cave Creek. The service was fast & very friendly. The food was excellent. Loved having 3 salsas with our chips. The decor was fun & festive. The outdoor seating area was pleasant. Worth the short drive from Scottsdale & fun to walk around after or before at the quirky shops in Cave Creek.
