Carlitos is awesome. Finally a place in Vegas that has REAL Green and Red Chile. Roberto's, Faustos, and any other bland place that uses can chile is no comparison. This place makes you feel like your in New Mexico with its authentic flavors. I know its not fair in comparing them to anything else here. I'm a little biased because I think New Mexican cuisine is far more superior then Tex-Mex, or Mexican. What I do compare is the style of tacos, enchiladas, and burritos. Hands down Carlitos has them beat. Any of there burritos you can get real red or green chile inside them as well as smothered. The nachos with red Chile powder sprinkled on the chips and green chile hidden inside give the nachos a taste that is incredible. Navajo Tacos and Stuffed sopapillas are amazing. You haven't had a real Frito pie until you try it with the red new mexico chile Carlitos uses. They also have $1 drafts and specials everyday. Like $1 Santa Fe sliders. A little burger, with chipotle sauce and onions and tortilla. Keep in mind that this is New Mexican cuisine and not the stuff everyone is use to who never been to New Mexico. Its definitely better and I'm glad I have a place to have my Red and Green Chile fix since I only go to New Mexico a couple times a year.
