From start to finish this place was bomb.com!! As a native New Mexican I was def impressed with what they offered. The staff was friendly and helpful as well! I didn't have to wait long at all for my food and drinks. You do have to order at the counter and the food will be brought to you(no waitress).. The only complaint I do have is that the place is small and a lil hidden but other than that, 5 stars all the way!!!!
