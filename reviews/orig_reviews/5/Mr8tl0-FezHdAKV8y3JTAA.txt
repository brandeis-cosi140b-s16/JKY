When I first entered santos lucha libre, now most wanted taco shop, they let me try all the different types of meats available for their food. Everything tasted fantastic, and as authentic as it gets. The staff was extremely welcoming to new patrons, and wanted to get me and my girlfriend as excited about their restaurant as they were. The huge burrito that I completely devoured was one of the best burritos I have had in Phoenix and elsewhere. If you're thinking of a place to try, or just want some good food, I'd highly recommend going here.
