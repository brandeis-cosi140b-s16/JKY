Aw Aw Aw AWESOME (sorry for the stutter...but it was hard for me to express how much I love Carolina's.) 

Growing up in a border town, I love my Mexican food.  This also makes me ultra critical of Mexican restaurants.....but I have nothing critical to say (which is strange coming from someone who has the tag line "always the critic.")

The food is super authentic.  The price is great.  The facility is a total DIVE which makes me love it that much more.  The kitchen is wide open so you can watch the ARMY of staff making tortillas, prepping the food, and packing it for your tasty delight. 

 You gotta try this place!

PS - pick up a pack of piping hot tortillas to take home.  They are the size of a manhole cover.
