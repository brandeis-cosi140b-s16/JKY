I went here last weekend after trying, unsuccessfully, to get fed at two other places. Apparently everyone else had the same idea we did going to Black Dog at 2:30 on a Saturday; I was saddened, but not really surprised by the prohibitively long line there. Then at Golden Harbor, we stood at the counter for fifteen minutes while countless wait/kitchen staff walked past us without acknowledging us. Disappointed in two of my favorite restaurants, we shuffled off to try Maize. First of all, for such cramped quarters, service was really great. The waitress was prompt and friendly -- even though my standards may have been a bit lowered by circumstance, it was still more than I would expect from a hole-in-the-wall place like this. The food was outstanding. Excellent queso fundido, and the torta ahogada was delicious, if impossible to eat without a fork. I'll definitely be going back, even if I can get service elsewhere!
