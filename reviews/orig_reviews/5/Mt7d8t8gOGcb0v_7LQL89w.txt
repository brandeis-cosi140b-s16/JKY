What can I say? The best Mexican food restaurant in Central Phoenix!
The service was phenomenal and the food was even better!
Parking was behind the building in a very spacious lot which was being guarded by several security guards who went up and down the rows, I felt very safe!!

Upon entering I was greeted by a young man who greeted me and seated me rather promptly. My waiter came within five minutes and brought chips and salsa! I ordered the Chimichanga and a michelada. WOW! The meat was seasoned perfectly, not too much like some places and the frying was good, no excessive oil. I will definitely come back!

Give it a try if you desire REAL Mexican food!
