Yet another great experience, just when I thought it couldn't get any better...we tried the seafood combo plate..... Wow!! It was absolutely delicious. Its enough food to feed 3-4 people. We washed it all down with climato prepped beer! Another favorite of mine. Overall great food, nice atmosphere and friendly staff. I highly recommend Bonito Michoac√°n.
