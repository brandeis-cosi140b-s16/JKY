I love this place.  Great food, great atmosphere, and good prices for the incredible view of the strip.  All the shrimp dishes are delish.  Try either the beef or pork with Coca-Cola sauce, if you are Coke fan.  Parking is a pain during prime hours, but that is only because this place is so popular.  You will always eventually find a parking spot, there just might be a little bit of walk to the restaurant.  Once you get inside, you will realize it was worth the distractions.
