WOW!  We go to El Zocalo fairly often have always enjoyed the ambience of the patio and the food.  The patio in the July or January is still wonderful - very pretty, private... and live music on Fri/Sat.  A little more expensive, but the patio is such a beautiful eve spot.  Hang out after or before dinner -  sit around the fountain and enjoy a drink and music.
