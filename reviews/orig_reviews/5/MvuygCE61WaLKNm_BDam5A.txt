Hello (reliable) deliciousness! I swear the menu has grown 2-fold since I lived in the 'burgh.  

I decided to change it up this time (my standby meal is shrimp funguy taquitos and the black bean and pineapple quesadilla with tofu). I ordered the black bean soup and the Pennsyltucky fried tofu. The tofu was a knockout! So crispy and flavorful, with nice sprigs of cilantro and sprouts on the side. Loved the salty warm peanuts too. The soup was meant to be like the Kiva black bean dip, but the dip is so decadent (read: fattening) and spicy, while the soup is just watery and missing the cheesy rich goodness of the dip, which I guess I should've expected. But still, it was all delicious. 

My friends got the burritos, which I think are amazing, but sort of boring compared to everything else on the menu. I ordered a big azz mango marg, per the usual and was not dissappointed. I LOVE this place. Everytime i'm in the city I will go here. It's a must!
