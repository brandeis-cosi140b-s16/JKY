I have never had a bad meal here . Always top notch ! I love this restaurant! However for the first time I sat with my friend on the patio during dinner and we both agree that you guys need to sex up the patio. Music . Lights. More plants .maybe fire at night ? I still love love the restaurant  but as a server on the strip  this is what I suggest.  Will be back !
