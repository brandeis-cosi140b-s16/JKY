This was our first time here. Great service, great ambience, and great food. We came for lunch and ordered the queso as an appetizer. It was amazing, filled with Chorizo, spinach, onions, etc. We also loved corn tortilla chips that were served with it. We could tell they were homemade and they we're delicious. 

After filling up on the queso, we didn't have much room for a huge main dish so we eCh ordered the tacos. I had steak tacos and my husband had pork and they were both very good. The spicy fries were great, too
