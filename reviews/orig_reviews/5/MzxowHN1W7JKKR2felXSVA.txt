Just opened in beginning of June and hope they stay open for a long time. Fresh tasting New Mexican Mexican food. We had the burrito with both red/green sauces (Christmas style) and a very healthy chicken salad. There are freebies too...house made chips with very tasty salsa and a soft slightly buttery bread that tastes great with honey. Prices are very reasonable and our server was a very friendly dude. Highly recommended!
