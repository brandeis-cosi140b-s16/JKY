What once was an original Cathedral church founded in 1893 with the most breathtaking stained glass windows, just west of 7th St & Osborn, you'll now find a very modern aged building that reads Taco Guild, a place where "The Guild of Taco Eaters" congregate. Some come together once a day, while others maybe once a week; the subject of conversation is subjective & very top secret. On this beautiful fine day that is March 25, a group of very fine individuals by the name of Ashley, Victor & Anthony, came together for what shall be called "Happy Hour". Ashley ordered the Vegetarian Taco, which happens to be the "Most Amazing Vegetarian Taco" that she has ever eaten, mind it she's eaten quite the amount of tacos in her life. It was paired perfectly with an 1893 Margarita On the rocks. Sir Victor decided on 3 Daily Tacos with a very vintage bottle of Coca Cola. The daily taco happened to be Chicken & Pork Fajita Taco, topped with some lettuce, sour cream, pickled peppers wrapped in a fresh made tortilla all for $1.99. Finally, Maison Anthony Leroux, had 2 daily tacos, a side of the Borracho Red Beans topped with Cotija cheese, the Green Chile Achiote Rice with Anaheim peppers, fresh corn, red bell pepper, with lime, & a wonderful 1893 Iced Margarita. The evening was divine all thanks to the wonderful Lady of Grace, Miss Patrice, with her beautiful blue mane & smile of a million stars. Thank you Patrice.
