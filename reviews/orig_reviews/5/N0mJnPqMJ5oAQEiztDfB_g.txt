I was born and raised in Las Cruces New Mexico.  This is not Mexican food.  I know what you are saying.  "But, Ernesto the sign says Carlito's Burritos, it's gotta be Mexican food."  No, sir this is New Mexican cuisine, and this is how we roll!  All you Cali people can take your tacos and tapatio hot sauce somewhere else.  

We learned about this place from a friend who is also from New Mexico about a year ago and I almost started crying when I ordered food in Las Vegas with real hatch green chile.  This is my comfort food spot.  Every time I get a little home sick I know I can count on Dave and his staff to cook up some excellent food straight from the recipe book of Nuevo Mexico!  

My recommendation if you have never feasted on genuine New Mexican food is to try out the stuffed sopapillas.  This is something you don't see done in California and they are awesome.  This place also has some daily specials.  I am personally a fan of green chile more so than red chile.  My mom makes the best red chile so it's hard to compare to other places.  Also don't be a sissy when you eat here.  We like our green chile and we like it hot.  spicy food is alway the best food anyway.  I can go on an on about Carlitos and I can even try to explain what New Mexican food is but I can't.  You just need to try it to see why your life has been incomplete before eating something spectacular from a cool state!  Cheers! and speaking of cheers they have $1 draft beers too!
