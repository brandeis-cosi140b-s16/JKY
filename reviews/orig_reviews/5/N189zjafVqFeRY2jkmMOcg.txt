Well, right now I am sporting a very large Del Ray baby and have a huge smile on my face. I just brought home some food from  here and it was fantastic! I of course saw this place on Man V Food and had to give it a try since it was not to far from my house. This was my first time trying a Torta. I actually had no idea there was a Mexican style sandwich and I have been living in Phoenix for 42 years now. Where the hell have I been right? Well, I drove over and walked in and was pleasantly surprised. It was a very nice place. Nice and clean, the staff was very nice and helpful. The place was pretty packed and I had to stand in line for a bit to place my order. I ended up ordering a Del Ray Torta and something else I dont know the name of right now. It was a fried tortilla with beans, pork, lettuce and cheese. Both were extremely good. I had planned to take a few bites of the pork tortilla and put the rest in the fridge for tomorrow but that didnt happen. This thing was great and I ended up eating the hole damn thing. I then started in on my Torta. THIS WAS FANTASTIC!!!! If I would have known I would have started with this first. I polished off half of it pretty quickly. I then sat back and relaxed for a minute before starting in on the second half. This was the end of my partaking for the evening. I realized how incredibly full I was and I didnt think it would be a good idea trying to put anymore down there. I am now sitting here trying to type and breathe and not doing well at either. 
       If you try this place just make sure you remember one thing, don't order to much because you will eat EVERYTHING you order. Then you will not be able to breathe or move. But your taste buds will love you.
