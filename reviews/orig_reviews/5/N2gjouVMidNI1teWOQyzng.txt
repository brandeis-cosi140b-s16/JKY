Barrio Cafe in Phoenix and Barrio Queen have the best stylized  Mexican food in the state. They use healthy ingredients and they make their dishes with a fusion twist. I highly recommend their guacamole. I typically can't stand guac and I love it here. At Barrio Queen, they also have a sushi style street taco menu. It is fantastic and I find myself ordering on here more often than not. Highly recommend!
