No question in my mind - Lindo is the best Mexican restaurant in Henderson.

The menu is strikingly large, varied, and interesting. Starting with their table-prepared guacamole is a must. The margaritas are strong and well made. One of my favorites entrées is their Gallo al Coñac - chicken breast in a creamy cognac sauce - but you can hardly go wrong. 

The wide open dining room has a lively energy to it, if sometimes a bit loud. The servers are fast and friendly. There's live music nearly every night, it seems.

The building is situated on a hill, and has enormous windows running the full length of the restaurant, giving it one of the nicest views of any Henderson restaurant.

If you've got the taste for Mexican, you really can't go wrong with Lindo Michoacan.
