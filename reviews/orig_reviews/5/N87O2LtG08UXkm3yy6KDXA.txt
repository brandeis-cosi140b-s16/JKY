Maple Bacon Milkshake: Nice and salty with bits of crunchy bacon and pecan in every creamy sip.  While the presentation may not be as fancy as Zinburger, the styrofoam cup is convenient to take with you, and keeps the shake nice and cold.  I was very happy that it was not so thick that I needed a spoon, and that it stayed chilled throughout my meal 

Brûlée Burger: The burnt sugar crusted bun was amazing.  The bacon and egg were perfectly cooked, and the meat was a nice juicy medium-well bordering on well-done.  I'm usually not a dressing fan but I didn't mind it.  I'll do admit I will probably ask for no lettuce and dressing next time to perfect a carnivore masterpiece.  Like the shake, the texture of the burger was excellent, so whoever is the chef has a great grasp on putting together solid recipes with a good "mouth feel."

The customer service was fantastic.  The guy manning the register was very friendly, and another young male employee checked up on me and offered to take my empty burger basket and trash away.  He was also very quick to clear off and wipe down tables once people had left.

Atmosphere-wise, it's very well put together for a small restaurant, and while crowded, I didn't feel claustrophobic.  I also was very happy they keep their music at a very decent level.  The name-calling for orders wasn't that distracting.

There was also plentiful parking on a Saturday afternoon!  I'll be back.
