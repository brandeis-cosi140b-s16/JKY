Was referred by a friend because I was looking for some good tamales to have for Christmas dinner.  So this was my 1st time going here.  I ordered 2 dozen tamales.  I got a dozen pork and 6 cheese 6 of the other flavor they have but I cant remember what it was at the moment...chicken & green sauce I think??   The cheese ones were ok ...too much cheese for me.  The chicken & green sauce were very yummy but my fav was the pork tamales.  I will be getting tamales from here every Christmas from now on.   Would like to dine in and try some of their other food.
