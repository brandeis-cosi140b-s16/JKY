Absolutely the best Fish and Shrimp Tacos I've had. The Mexicali Shrimp Cocktail was exquisite! This isn't your normal American Shrimp Cocktail... It is a traditional Mexican style cocktail with shrimp broth, Clamato, chopped vegetables, avocados, served with a side of light flavored and salted chips. I also ordered the blackened grouper taco and the seasoned shrimp taco. Delicious! My wife had the fried fish which was cooked perfect too! Highly recommend but get there early because come Friday or the weekend around 4:30pm...it will be packed and you'll wait up to 2 hours for a table.
