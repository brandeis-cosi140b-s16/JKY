Excellent place.  5 of us went there for dinner after a business conference.  The waiter was excellent - recommended a drink tequila mixed drink for the table which was very good (grapefruit/tequila/lime mixed drink in a pitcher).  Excellent tasting food - we had tacos, spring rolls, lamb pot stickers, noodles, mongolian beef - all very good.  We will definitely go back.
