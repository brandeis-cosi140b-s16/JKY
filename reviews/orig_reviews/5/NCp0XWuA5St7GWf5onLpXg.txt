Bomb ass tacos!! Coming from east LA I've had my share of some kick ass tacos and these rank right up there with the best! Tortillas are made fresh from a ball of masa as you order!! Meat is clean and flavorful!! Tacos come with all the fixings or you can fix them yourself at the salsa bar!! Best taco place in vegas hands down!! Ordering is a bit confusing at first but provides personal attention to your order as the different stations provide different meats and sides!!  Ponle Sal.
