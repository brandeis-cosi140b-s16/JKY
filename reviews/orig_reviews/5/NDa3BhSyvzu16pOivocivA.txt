This is my favorite New Mexican place ever! I am a huge fan of Mexican and no place does it better. The food is spicy, so beware but that is also what makes it awesome! I binge chip at this place and drink the salsa, and I always ask for extra chips to bring back home for snacking (even better if I have leftover beans to bring back too). SO TASTY! SO SPICY. YEA! 
A great place for lunch or dinner. The tamales are best! I like the chicken and the pork. For lunch I usually order off the a la carte menu and get a side of beans which is a lot of food for a lunch that ends up costing less than $10. If you are really hungry, go for the burrito...it's huge! 
I can't stop thinking about their tamales. I am having one for lunch today.
