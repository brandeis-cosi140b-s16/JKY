Last night, I took my parents to the Border Grill and it was an amazing dining experience.  All the food at the restaurant is prepared fresh, and you can taste the difference. We had the Yucatan pork the chili relleno and the short rib enchiladas. These are all excellent dishes. The chili relleno was the best I've ever tasted.  The Yucatan pork, of course, is a staple at the Border Grill, and it was excellent last night. The sweet corn tamales from the appetizer menu are beyond delicious. The server was friendly, engaged and attentive.  I highly recommend this place.
