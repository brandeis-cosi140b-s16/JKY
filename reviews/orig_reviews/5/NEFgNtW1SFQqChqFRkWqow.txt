This is a great place for lunch.  You can have a ten minute or sixty minute lunch, up to you - the staff will meet you half way on whatever YOU WANT.  Be sure to ask for Violetta, she gives the best service and is so pleasant, you'll want to come every day.  Ask for a bowl of the special picante sauce that they make daily and be sure to get the guacamole made table side.  Other than that, get what  you are hankering for because all of the food is good.  Don't miss this place - can't beat the price/quality mix!  ENJOY!
