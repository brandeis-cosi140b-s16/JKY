Most Wanted Taco gets all the stars and more!!!! I was blown away! Such a great local owned spot, with owners who take pride in their product! So glad we found this gem!! 

When we walked in, one of the women asked if we had been in before, and when we said we hadn't, she gave us each a fork and started filling sample cups one at a time, letting us sample every.single.meat they offered! Without us even asking. She just really wanted us to taste everything. I can't even remember the last time I had such awesome welcoming service! 

They have several types of chicken, beef, and pork, with several different levels of spiciness in each. After they add the meat, you can pick what other toppings you want - raw or pickled onions, cilantro, cabbage, shredded romaine, cheese, sour cream, corn. 

I had two small tacos (on corn vs. the large on flour) - one creamed chicken and one carnitas. The creamed chicken was so tender and super spicy (rated 3 chilies, their hottest) and even though my mouth was on fire, it was amazing! The carnitas were tender and flavorful and when you order, they take it from the hot line and put it on the grill to crisp it up. Authentic and delicious! I kept my tacos simple with cilantro, pickled onions, and sour cream and they were perfect! Everyone in my group loved their tacos!!! 

The only thing that wasn't off the charts was their guacamole, sadly. It was pretty bland, needed a little more salt and/or lime. 

There is ample seating, which is super nice! I'm bummed I don't live in the area, because I would be back on the regular!!
