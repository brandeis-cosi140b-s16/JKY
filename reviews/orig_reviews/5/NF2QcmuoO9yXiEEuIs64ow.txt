Korean and Mexican Fusion, huh, you got to be kidding!!! However, it worked for me and for my entourage. We went on May 27, 2012 and were delighted. I'm a vegetarian so for me the vegetarian burrito infused with Kim Chi was a culinary tasteful experience. 

My entourage, loved their choices as well. 

This is a unique, non-fast food original cuisine that is well worth the experience. I will definitely be a repeat customer.  

In my opinion their prices were too low. They should move to China Town, increase their prices 20% and will still double their business.
