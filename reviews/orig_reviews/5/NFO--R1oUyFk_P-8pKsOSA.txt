Everything from the moment you walk in is amazing. The decor, the hospitality and the food. This is trully a hidden gem and it is slightly off the beaten path. The first time I was there was in the evening and the gorgeous patio knocked my socks off. We had people from out of town and they were impressed with the beautiful patio area with its open southwest theme. When inside, the theme continues. Friendly staff, knowledgeable waitress and great food. I had the green chillie burrito and found it to have the perfect level of spiceiness. Overall service was good however my wife's dish took an extra 2 minutes to get to table. Otherwise good presentation and good food for all. I will definitely be going back and I can not give a higher recommendation in all of Chandler. Even downtown.
