First let me say thank you to Stateside Presents for creating a music venue, in the heart of downtown Phoenix!  I was ecstatic to hear of this venue and when I went to my first show there, I was happy it lived up to all the hype.  I love the bleacher style seating in the back, for those shows you don't feel like standing at...genius idea.  Everything about this place, is the perfect size.  Chris Bianco, of Pizzeria Bianco, and Doug Robson, of Gallo Blanco (located in the Clarendon Hotel) oversee the menu here and they offer some vegan options, so it is an automatic win in my opinion!  Not a huge menu, but it is just enough.  You can eat, have a few drinks and then head in to the ballroom for the show....makes for a nice evening.  And when there isn't a show happening, it is open for business as usual and DJ's are spinning some of your favorite tunes.  All in all, I dig this place and highly recommend it.
