I love Joyride too much for my own good. My friend always raved about this place so I finally gave in. We came here on a friday around 9 pm and were immediately seated outside. We got the guacamole and three different tacos, which were all amazing. Our server was really nice and the music was great. I will definitely be returning soon.
