Never had anything bad!  First choice: tortilla soup... Perfectly filling and not as high on calories as some other menu items.  Second choice: chx nachos aghhhh so bad for you but oh so good! Perfect to share! Like I said before everything is amazing!  Pork is awesome as well perfectly sweet! Salads are freshtastic and depending on what you get on it they actually can be healthy.  Substitute the dressing for salsa fresca just as delicious! If dining in try the strawberry lemonade...yummy.  The only thing I can say is... I actually never had dessert from here.  This is my go to place!
