So excited to see new restaurants moving into district 4! Gadzooks is an amazing concept started by Aaron. I had their pork green chile and guajillo short rib "chirstmas style" enchiladas which means a combination of the red and green sauce. Its so cool to see them making the tortillas fresh in house and I absolutely loved their lava salsa which is so spicy but so good. Also the homemade guac is fresh and delicious. Cant wait to come back and try the bison.
