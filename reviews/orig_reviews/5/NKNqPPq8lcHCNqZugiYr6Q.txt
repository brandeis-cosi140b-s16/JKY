Here right now.   Excellent food.  This is real mexican food..not americanized.  Had the chanclas (roll stuffed w chicken with chorizo sauce on top), molletes (bread toasted w beans and mozzarella) and chilaquiles (sort of like nachos).  Great choices and great food.  Will be back to try more.  Great value too.
