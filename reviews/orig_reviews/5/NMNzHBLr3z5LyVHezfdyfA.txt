Is it weird that my favorite taqueria is in Las Vegas?  This place is awesome, and when I say awesome I mean life changingly awesome.  

The meats here are delicious and watching the cooks work their stations here is nothing short of impressive.  They are so freakin' fast! The food is really why you are here, and it doesn't disappoint.

The lengua is tasty, moist, and super tender. The al pastor is well seasoned and not too dry. The cabeza is delicious as well, give it a try. 

The carne asada is really where it's at though. Unlike most taquerias, they actually grill the carne asada here. It has char!  It's not just steak on a hot top here.  It makes a huge difference.  Want to kick up the carne asada? Get the carne asada fries.  The fries are crisp and are the perfect complement to the savory goodness of the carne asada. Don't forget the real guacamole on top as well!

Oh yeah, did I mention the sauces? I have no idea what a lot of them are, but man, do they make the meats sing!!!  

Everything is good here, even the marinated veggies that come on the side of the plate.  
I am glad that this place is so far away from home, because if it wasn't, I'd have to buy bigger clothes!
