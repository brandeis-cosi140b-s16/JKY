Do yourself a favor and eat here!  This place has got it going on!!!  We ordered lots of things to share and each dish was more delicious than the next!  My favorites were the summer corn, pad thai al pastor, strawberry gazpacho, and the tuna ceviche.  Also, the mochis were delicious, my favorite flavor was the passion fruit.  There are not enough superlatives in the English language to describe the taste and quality of the food.  The service was excellent.  Our waitress Danielle was so friendly, knowledgable of the menu, conscientious of dietary restrictions, and generally good at her job.  We spoke to the general manager, who took an active interest in our experience.  Definitely one of the best meals I've had in the Phoenix area.  We'll be back the next time we're in town.  Like another reviewer said:  foodie fusion heaven!
