great food and good prices.  food has been 5 stars 6/7 times that we ate there.  complimentary chip and salsa bar for dinner is a pretty cool edition too. i fell in love with the chile relleno (so delicious everytime) so i havent ventured anywhere else on the menu yet.  the girlfriend always gets their machaca taco/chz enchilada/ tostada (#1) combo which is also delicious.  both meals for under $20.  dont forget to leave a tip for the courteous staff!!
