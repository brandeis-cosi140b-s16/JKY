I so want to meet the chef owners of this place.  We keep going back every time we are in Las Vegas and are absolutely never disappointed.  I had a skinny margarita and when my husband mentioned we'd had a prickly pear margarita once, they concocted one for him.  They had a fish special which is what I had and oh so good.  My husband had fish tacos which he said were delicious.  Their chips are some of the best around and the guacamole, well it's wonderful as well.  We've never had room for dessert so I have no idea if it's good or not.
