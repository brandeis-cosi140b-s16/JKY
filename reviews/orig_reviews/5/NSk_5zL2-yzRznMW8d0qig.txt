We absolutely love Lindo Michoacan and come back every chance we can.   We came here years ago after seeing Rachel Ray in 2008 brag about this place on her Food Network show as one of the Best authentic Mexican Restaurants in Vegas.  They have a great menu, it will take you a while to go through it, so order a drink and relax while you browse.  The prices are very reasonable $10-15 for dinner and lunch specials for $8.50-$11, which you can't say about other Mexican Restaurants in the strip.  It is a short drive or taxis ride from the strip on Desert Inn Road East.  I can't believe a search on Trip Advisor doesn't come up with this restaurant even when searching for Mexican Cuisine.   The restaurant offers a free shuttle service to the closest monorail station.    Here is their website - http://www.lindomichoacan.com    We've enjoyed several of their chicken dishes including El Burro Bianico (enchilada style burrito), Chicken Fajitas, and Enchiladas.  We've also had a few Margaritas and beers here too.   We highly recommend Lindo Michoacan Mexican Restaurant for dinner.  How can you go wrong when they've been voted "The Best of Las Vegas" for the eight times!
