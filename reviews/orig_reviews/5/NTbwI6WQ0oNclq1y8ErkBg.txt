I love this place. Great atmosphere! Sophisticated and charming. I am on a restricted diet and I was more than impressed by  our waitress's friendly, and positive attitude towards all of my substitutions. Food was excellent, and I am picky!  Everything came out fresh and hot and I will be back often.
