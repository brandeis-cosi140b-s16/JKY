Love the food. Wife and I visit her ever so often and I've tried a few different dishes. This place is not your run of the mill regular meat, cheese, tortilla and red sauce Mexican cuisine. Plenty of seafood and veggie items. The salsa bar alone is something to visit for as there are so many delicious items.
