Annudah Braddah Fan!
Had a Groupon, so we checked it out the other night. OMG...best experience we've ever had at a "fast food" venue! Walking in, they asked if it was our first time. "Yes." So they gave us samples of the meats to try.  Hubby couldn't get over how moist the grilled chicken pieces were; and I would fight anybody for more of their Kalua pig! Can't wait to go try the steak and fish.
Be judicious with the many, many choices of add-ons. For instance, I won't combine the nori-studded rice with the Kalua pork again. Don't want anything to overpower that melt-in-your-mouth smoky pig. The rice is probably better with the fish; but the black beans went just fine with pork and chicken. Wow, the fresh salsas--they were awesome on everything. And they also put some amazing hot sauces (Pickapeppa and Mango-Habanero, yum!) on the tables too.
The $20 Groupon was enough to cover both our meals, including soft drinks and a dessert, so that tells you how reasonable the prices are. The menu is limited...but if you are in the mood for Hawaiian style proteins w/ Mexican style add-ons, this is THE place to go get it. And the friendly staff is a nice change from most "counter service" places too. 
You MUST try the chocolate bark--if you don't like coconut you can scrape it off!. It is like the "saltines toffee" I make at home every year for Christmas, but w/ 2x the toffee and 3x the chocolate on top. Buttery chocolaty salty HEAVEN! You can tell its fresh-made with really good chocolate and real butter in the soft toffee. A generous  5-6 oz. bag of it for $3.50. This stuff would be $30/lb. at a Strip chocolatier.
