I don't give out 5 stars. But this is a little gem. It's not TexMex and its not a taco shop its a Mexican restaurant.  As in Mexico it does not look good from the outside, in fact if it was not for yelp I would have driven right by the place. Food is great service is good.  My one note would be the portions are too big!! Yes they gave a full bar. If this was anywhere near where I live I would have my own table. I'll be back.
