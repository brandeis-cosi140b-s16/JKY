Excellent stop during our visit to Las Vegas. This place will not disappoint. No matter a burrito, asada tacos, or a quesadilla, all the food is good. Fresh salsa and homemade chips top it all off. You will leave happy and FULL. 

Definitely a must try for all those who are picky about your Mexican food. I'm a little picky since I grew up on San Antonio Mexican food, but this place is GOOD.
