Strong consistency, strong effort and teamwork, great menu with lots of choices, family-dining prices.

I've become a regular at Mi Casa at Silverton. I love their 2-item/3-item combo. I get pork tamale+ cheese enchilada. Comes with rice & beans. Steak tampequenia and rancho del sur, and the red snapper is also good! Shrimp cocktail, fajitas of three varieties... all good! The fried ice cream is superior in preparation and ingredients to any other in Las Vegas, in my experience.

Average price per person about $20  plus drink tax and tip.  Frequent happy hour specials of varying themes and varieties... plus this business updates their Yelp page frequently.

A fine appointment of decor and accouterment compliments the south-of-the-border music. Even the cutlery is worthy of appreciation. A large bar and lounge caters to the numerous slot-machines and high-top bistro tables and the spacious dining room can manage multiple large groups.

All in all, the primary reason why you should choose Mi Casa is the people that work here. I look for direct involvement and engagement from servers, bartenders, kitchen staff, managers...  and the staff at Mi Casa are hands-on invested in the success of this business. And that's really tough to do ... Every... Single... Day... And at Mi Casa, they do it. Every... Single... Day. It's a repeatable pattern of excellence that's hard to beat. Each and every meal I've had here is of a  consistently high quality delivered Every Single Time by motivated and hard working people. 

It's not hard to figure out what restaurants deserve your patronage. Mi Casa is one restaurant that earns it. Every... Single... Day! I'm smitten with Samantha and Marsha and wonderful Miriam. Give Mi Casa Grill Cantina a try...you will be too!
