Not only is the food impeccable, but they can also handle a line out the door and half way down the block in a way that is truly impressive. The staff is friendly and willing to make recommendations; the food is inexpensive and lick your fingers delicious. This place does everything right. While we were waiting in line, other customers went out of their way to tell us what their favorites are. This place has serious devotees and after one bite, it's not hard to understand why. Be sure to try the pastor!
