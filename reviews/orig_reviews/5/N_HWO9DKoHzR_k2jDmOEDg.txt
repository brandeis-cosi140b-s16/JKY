Fantastic Food, Great Prices, Happy Atmosphere! Mexican food in AZ is about as common as you can get, and most Zonies have begun to think that all Mexican food is alike. Padre's is out of the ordinary - a step up. It's got a great bar, with tons of interesting tequilas. It has an outdoor patio where you can really relax. The food blew me away - especially when we got our soup, and it said "padres", written with sour cream or cheese or something. It's like a real fancy restaurant, only it's not stuffy at all. It's actually fun, and I'm not someone who likes the typical bar scene. I had fun, and I'm definitely going back. We stayed and danced Salsa, and after a while it was packed house. One big guy backed into the band - they paused for a beat, and then continued playing!
