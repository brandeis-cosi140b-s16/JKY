Great service, great food. We had guacamole (we picked the ingredients including smoked salmon which was a bit smelly), queso fundido, tako, and duck confit. All were delicious. Loved the herbs and vegetables in the tacos. 

The drinks were OK. We had desert lilly (frozen of the day), michelada, and Ramon's gin fizz. Not much of alcohol in the drinks. Ramon's gin fizz was the best of all. 

It's a bit dark there and smells a bit like food. No problem for me.
