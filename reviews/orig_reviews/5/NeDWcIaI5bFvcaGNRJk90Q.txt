Easy 5 star. Was looking for a mexican place near work that wasn't chipotle. Felt like I was taking a gamble when I saw the place but it turned out to be very delicious. 

Simple build your own burrito, tacos, enchiladas menu. 

Ingredients were fresh and wholesome. 

Service was great.

Can't wait to come back to my new favorite place to grab lunch!
