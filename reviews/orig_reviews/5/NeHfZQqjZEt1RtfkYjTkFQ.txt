There seems to be a bit of an identity crisis with naming this place, but I hope they never change their recipes. Our party had veggie taco salad, veggie, red chile beef, asada beef, and green chile pork tacos. Besides having some cilantro end up on a couple of tacos due to a "no" being misconstrued as a "yes", our meal hit the spot. I am sure any of us will return if ever back in town.
