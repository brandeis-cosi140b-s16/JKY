This was a superb experience - everything about it - the food and the service! What a treat and worth every penny!
I was visiting from DC and read about the restaurant so the concierge at the Fairmont  made me a reservation for 1. I had a flank steak dish that was so tender with a Margarita that was the best i ever had.
The manager is Edison - what a star- its not every day that you get such star treatment as a single lady traveler!!!
