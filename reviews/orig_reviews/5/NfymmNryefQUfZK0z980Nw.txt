After hearing so many good reviews about this place I decided to make a trip towards downtown and check out these tacos. 

This place is a Tijuana based chain so I knew this place was going to be authentic. As you first walk in you immediately see the boiling baths of meat and the rotating pork stack for the tacos al pastor. This place reminded me of my early days of partying in Tijuana and finding taco vendors on the street.  

The ordering system was a little confusing but the guys behind the counter were helpful to clear up the confusion. Each station has designated meats to choose from so you line up behind the station of your choice of meat. Me being the adventurous eater we decided on three meats, Cabeza (cow head), Lengua (cow tongue), and Tripas (tripe). Each taco is served on freshly made corn tortillas with cilantro, onions and salsa. 

The cabeza and the legua were cooked to perfection, so tender they melt in your mouth. My favorite was the Tripas which were deep fried which gave it a rich fatty taste. MMMMMM soooo goooood!! I had a total of four tacos but could of went for more. 

Tacos El Gordo is one of the best taco spots here in Vegas. So if you ever find yourself downtown or looking for some good grub after a late night of drinking head over to Tacos El Gordo for some authentic Mexican street tacos.
