Not the best area of town, but you will be happy you made the trip.  We saw La Pinata advertised on the news and check them out Saturday.  We were greeted nicely at the door and taken to our table.  My server was phenomenal.  He was very high energy, SERVICE WITH SMILE, and attentive.  The food was AWESOME.  Our Pina Coladas were DELICIOUS. The chips and salsa was fresh.  The salsa was the best we ever had and the chips were served warm. We ordered two chicken tacos.  They were very flavorful and heaping full of meat.  We could not get over how everyone worked so nicely together.  Everyone appeared to be working very hard and everything was done with a smile.
