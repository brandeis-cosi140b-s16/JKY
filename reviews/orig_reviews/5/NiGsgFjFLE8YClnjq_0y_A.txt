I love this place. Tacos el Gordo has nothing on it. The tacos are juicy big and freshly made in front of you. They even have nopalitos that they also make fresh. I love the extensive salsa bar it has like six different salsas. It has grilled onions jalape√±os and black beans and pinto beans.. Love this place!! Highly Recommend! Best tacos place in VEGAS!
