I wasn't expecting for their food or service to be that great but it exceeded my expectations. I was so happy to see they had a nice variety of vegetarian/vegan options, especially worth it on Happy Hour!! My first time experience was phenomenal, from their food to their service! Shoutout to David, Eva and Krystal*!!
