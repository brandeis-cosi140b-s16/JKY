If there was a way to leave 10 stars I would. This place is amazing good and super friendly. Everyone is happy to be here super friendly. Food is the best Mexican and street tacos I've ever had. Bartender Bridge is a mixologist who knows her business. Serving staff is very attentive and fun. Food is the best EVER.!!! I would fly here from anywhere in the states to eat here. Best hidden spot in Vegas..!!! Can't say enough good things about this business.

We ate here twice so far. Brandon and Jessie were the best servers.!! Bridge made the best margarita in the world.  I wish I lived here because I'd eat here every day.
