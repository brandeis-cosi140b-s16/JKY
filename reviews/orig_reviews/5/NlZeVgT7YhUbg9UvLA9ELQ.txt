Probably my favorite taco place ever. No matter which tacos I choose it's an orgasm in my mouth, and you can't go wrong with the 3 dollar house margaritas. The artwork in the restaurant is very cool as well, and is all local. I love that they're open until midnight, it's a great place to go after a DBacks game. I live in Gilbert right by Joyride Taco House and I'd much rather make the drive to Paz if I'm in a taco eating mood.
