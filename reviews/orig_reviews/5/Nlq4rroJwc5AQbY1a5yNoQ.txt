Blue Adobe Grill, how do I love thee?  Let me count the ways.  
I love you every day of the the week, but especially on Thursdays!

I love the way you greet me with a plate of tricolor chips,
And the jar of chipotle salsa to pour into a bowl so I may dip.

I love to hear Ivan sing and strum his guitar away,
As I savor every bite of my free caesar salad and creme brulee. (Thursday night special if you order a Blue plate)

I love you as I devour your salmon, rellenos, tacos or tamales,
But don't forget those delicious beans, they also make me jolly.

I love that you have great specials everyday of the week,
Of delicious New Mexican fare does the menu bespeak.

I also love your kids menu and your exceptional staff.
One last tip, don't forget to order sangria by the carafe.
