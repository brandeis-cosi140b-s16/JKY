5 stars because I can't wait to come back. If you enjoy great food and nice people in a non-pretentious atmosphere that brings you back to the southwest, this place belongs on your list of places to try. And if you enjoy spicy food, order the habanero burger.. Fantastic! If you don't do spicy, don't worry. The menu has something for everybody.
 
The theme here is all things New Mexico. Even the bar is made of copper with little red chili Christmas lights creating a really inviting Southwestern ambiance. The menu is paper (which is far more sanitary) and looks like a newspaper. Take the time to read it, it's hilarious!!

There is also an extremely cool outdoor area to enjoy drinks with friends & family in the beautiful AZ weather.

Ask for Krista in the bar area (bar top & booths), she'll take great care of you!
