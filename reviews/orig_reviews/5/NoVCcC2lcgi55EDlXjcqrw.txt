We tried the tacos (Bulgogi, Pork Belly, and Calamari), KoMex Nachos w/KimChi, and Wonton soup. Everything was delicious and the meat was really cooked perfectly! There wasn't a bunch of fat on it and it wasn't rubbery or chewy. Their slaw they put on the tacos is kind of sweet and if you want hot sauce they bring you 4 types (2 Mexican and 2 Korean), though none of it is really that spicy. Food portions were decent and my wife and I ended up with take out after ordering only a half size nacho and soup to split with the tacos. Service was friendly and the price was reasonable. We will definitely be back.
