Can't say enough good things about this place. The food, the atmosphere, the service- all fabulous! To start, the complimentary chips and salsa were outstanding. The salsa was very flavorful without being too spicy. The taco and sweet corn were just delicious. And the house margarita was perfect! One of the best I've had. Only thing that wasn't amazing was the rice, which was a little dry. But the best part was the check- a full meal with drinks and tip for less than $25!! You can't beat that! I wish I lived in Phoenix so I could come back here all the time.
