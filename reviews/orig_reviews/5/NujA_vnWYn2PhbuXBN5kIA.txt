Came for lunch today! Really good! I've been eyeballing this place since my coworker brought it back to the office last week. Had the carne asada chimi. Really tasty. The steak was perfectly cooked. No need to pay extra for sour cream or guac, although they put it on top. I prefer it on the side but that is just my preference. Next time I'll get it on the side. Chimi was perfectly crisp. Only real "complaint" I had was they laid the chimi on a bed of shredded lettuce, which was just in the way... Again something I am sure I can ask them to hold next time.
