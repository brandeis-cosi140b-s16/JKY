The best meal we had in 4 days in Pittsburgh ! Went on Friday night, had about a 25 minute wait but man was it worth it ! Appetizers were the Southwestern wings which were incredible and the trio of dips which we couldn't stop eating! Main courses were the Mad Mex burrito with shrimp and chicken enchiladas, Fantastic !!  Excellent service too ! Will definitely be going back when we come back.
