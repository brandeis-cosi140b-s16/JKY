I always enjoy going here.  Service is fine, not rushed, but not too slow.  I get the enchilada with vegies and spinach.  Very good, healthy and consistent.   Chips are good but the two salsa are almost the same to me.  Drinks are good.   It is not your usual beans and rice 8$ plate place, and that is what makes it good.
