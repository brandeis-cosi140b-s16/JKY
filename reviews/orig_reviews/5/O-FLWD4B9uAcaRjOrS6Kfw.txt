We had an amazing experience with Carmie! She was friendly, witty, accommodating & suggested an amazing meal for us! The all you can eat tasting menu is phenomenal and totally worth the price! Our favorite was the strip steak, but we enjoyed everything we tried! Well done border grill, and definitely ask for Carmie as your server, she's one of the best servers I've had in Vegas! Did Vegas locals that are picky, we will definitely be back!
