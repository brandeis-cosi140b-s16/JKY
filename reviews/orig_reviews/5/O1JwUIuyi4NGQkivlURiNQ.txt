We really like this place!  A lot of the portions are small, typical for this kind of fine dining place, but my favorite dish (barbequed chicken on a bed of fries) is humongous and good for two people.  Love the churro/milkshake dessert, too.  My parents are terrific food snobs and they like this place a lot.
