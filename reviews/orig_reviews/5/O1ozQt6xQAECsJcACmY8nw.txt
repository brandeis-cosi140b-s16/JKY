My visit to Los Sombreros was a wonderful meal overall. The building atmosphere is very authentic to the cuisine and the service is attentive. The menu is pleasantly concise and you won't have to worry about feeling overwhelmed choosing an entree.  I had the smoked chicken enchiladas, one of six or so meat choices, with rice and black beans on the side.  The meal came to the table after a short wait, occupied by a nice serving of homemade tortilla chips & house salsa.  Entrees came garnished with steamed vegetables and were hot and fresh.  I could definitely tell that the tortilla used for the enchiladas was homemade and the sauce was stellar. It was quite flavorful with strong cilantro and garlic tones.  If you do not like cilantro, you may not like the sauce, but I found it to be very fresh and zesty.  An experience well deserving of 5 stars.
