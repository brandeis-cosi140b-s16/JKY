What an absolutely delight it was to dine at this restaurant! 

This restaurant serves what is truly authentic Mexican food. Beyond that, they serve local, organic, free-range and hormone-free ingredients. WOW! 

The sangria was absolutely unbelievable, refreshing, tasty and amazing. The carne asada tacos were juicy, flavor-rich and authentic. The chips came with three different sauces, each delicious and unique. 

The flan (for dessert) was hands-down the best flan I have EVER had! And I have had some darn good ones, believe me. 

To top it off, the executive chef (Paco) came to our table to talk to us and spent several minutes engaging us. We were truly gratified and wowed. He shared with us stories, including how the recipe for the flan belongs to his grandmother. He gave us his card, which contains his personal contact info. WHO DOES THAT?! 

We are happy to recommend this restaurant to all of our friends and everyone else, and we can't wait to return and dine!
