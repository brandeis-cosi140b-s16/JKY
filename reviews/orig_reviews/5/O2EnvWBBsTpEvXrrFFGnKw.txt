Great authentic Mexican food!! The best I have had since I moved to AZ. The restaurant atmosphere is nothing to brag about but we were there for the food. The workers were very nice and pleasant. I was the only white person in the place but did not feel out of place at all. Everyone made you feel welcome. I can't say enough about the food...it was delicious.
