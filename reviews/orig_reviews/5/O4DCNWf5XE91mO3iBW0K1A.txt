This is by far the best Mexican food I have ever eaten.  My co-worker turned me onto this place and it has ruined my previous favorite Mexican restaurants as there is no comparison.  It doesn't look like much on the outside, but the food is awesome.  I always get a Number 31 with beef and their beef is seasoned so good.  Love this place!!
