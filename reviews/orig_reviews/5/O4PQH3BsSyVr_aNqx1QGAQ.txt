This place is great. It is  dark inside  so use the flashlight on your phone for the menu or the waiters have little flashlights too. I had the chile rellenos and they were incredible. When i first got my dish it seemed small but as i started eating i got full. they served the chille rellenos on 1 plate and the beans and rice on another. good salsa. very impressed with the quality and good service.
