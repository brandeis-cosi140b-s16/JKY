OMG the best shrimp tacos in town!! When we got there it wasn't much but the food makes up for itself. The service was friendly and comforting. The prices are amazing. I was in Vegas for the weekend and I ended up going there twice. Their shrimp soup is good!! It had a lot of shrimp. The owner was so friendly. Their tacos, nachos, and quesadillas were also good. My friends and I were all completely satisfy and amazed. I love this place!!
