One of the best tacos in the valley. As a San Francisco Bay Area native this is the closest to the bay you can get. I've been looking for a bomb taco place in Arizona and I finally did. Chicken tacos where not dry. Spicy. And very flavorful. Also the carne asada plate was just the same. The only negative is I wish they provided more tortillas.. Will ask next time!
