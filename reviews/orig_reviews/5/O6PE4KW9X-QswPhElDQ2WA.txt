This definitely is one of Las Vegas best Mexican restaurants. From the decor to the service and the food, it all deserves 5+ stars. We found this place on Yelp and with all the great reviews everyone left we had to try it. The restaurant was as good or even better then everyone said it would be. We were greeted as soon as we walked in and seated right away. Our server came right out with chips salsa and beans to dip. After looking at the menu for a few minutes our server took our order and the food came right out. Everything everyone ordered looked and tasted great! We told our server it was one of our friends BDay and the whole restaurant came out and sang 2 songs to her! One in English and one in Spanish lol its was soo cool! They even gave her chooros topped with whipped cream lol we had a great time here and id recommend everyone who is looking for good food and great service to come here. You wont regret it!
