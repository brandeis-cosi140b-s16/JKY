Two words... Ensalada Marinera.  Two hollowed Avocado shells filled with Avocado, fresh salsa, Shrimp, Lettuce, Cheese, served a side of crackers lime and hot sauce.  I find this to be filling but not as overwhelming as a Coctel De Camarones.  (Shrimp Cocktail).  

Also, they serve you chips and hot sauce AND refried beans... mmmm that's a first.  This is my first visit to this North Las Vegas Gem.  I was highly impressed with the food quality and service.  


Please keep in mind that this review comes from a Mexican Native (from the state of Jalisco) so I you can rest assured I know a thing or two about Mexican cuisine. =P
