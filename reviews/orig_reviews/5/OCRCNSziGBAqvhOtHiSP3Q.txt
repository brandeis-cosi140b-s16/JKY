Mundo has, hands down, my favorite happy hour in Vegas. Ok well one of my top 3!

Popped in with girlies yesterday for snacks and sangria. Sangria and margaritas are $4. Can't beat that!  They make a quality fresh margarita - none of that premade mix crap. There are other drinks offered at happy hour as well. There's about 15 food items to choose from ranging in price from $3 for a moist delicious sweet corn tamale to $10 for steak skewers with chimichurri. The queso flameado and calamari are a must! Chips and salsa are complimentary and Aaron and Mark will take excellent care of you. 

Furthermore, it's awesome inside. The chocolate brown velvet coupled with the bright turquoise accents and hanging lanterns set the scene in this hidden gem.
