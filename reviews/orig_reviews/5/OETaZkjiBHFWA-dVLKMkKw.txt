My family of six and I celebrated a grandson's birthday and Chevys was his choice for tonight's dinner. Everything was perfect,  the food was great, came out of the kitchen hot and fresh.  Maria, our waitress stayed with us and made sure that we were well taken care of. I love this place.!  They have to best chips and salsa anywhere.
