So I accidentally found this gem through yelp while I was in Vegas. Let me tell you how happy I am that I found this freaking place! I've always had one spot that I always visit for food while I am visiting Vegas and now this place is going to be my new spot. 

This place is little bit off the strip and is little hard to find because it is wedged between these small random shops. Seating is limited due to space, and so is the parking. 

Other than what I've mentioned above... Their food is freaking amazing!!! If you are in Vegas, this place is a must! Their salsa is phenomenal! Their michelada is on point! I also had shrimper cooked in lemon and chile (i really don't know what it is called, sorry), shrimp empenada, and some bowl that had carne asada, spicy chorizo, cheese, cactus, and onions... So damn good!! Doesn't even matter what they are called! They are freaking delicious! 

I will be looking forward to my next trio to Vegas so I can go back to this place.
