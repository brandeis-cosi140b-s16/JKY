Excellent customer service and the food is always great. We had a random sauce bottle "explosion" and they were so apologetic and quick to clean it up. We had four employees (owner, manager, workers) come and apologize over and over again! It was not a big deal to us, but it was so awesome to see everyone check in even though there was a busy line. The service alone has put this restaurant on the top of our list! We ordered 3 rice Kahlua pig bowls and a steak burrito which were delicious. My husband loved the coconut sauce (bottle), which he said added a hint of curry-like flavor. The fruit salsas weren't spicy at all, but the mango was my favorite! The kid's bowls were surprisingly a good size to satisfy my hungry 7 year old. The Kahlua had a good flavoring and seasoning and the seaweed rice was a good addition. The coconut bark is so addictive. Sweet and salty, crunchy and chewy all in one bite! This is a great place for a quick sit down dinner in a relaxing, friendly environment.
