Thank you yelp for introducing me to this delicious taco place!!

I tried three different tacos, but the pork (adobado) was by far the most flavorful.

I also had the horchata that came out of a fountain. It was really sweet so I highly suggest diluting it with water and ice to make it a lighter refreshing summer drink.

Order at the open kitchen and pay at the cashier on the right. Line was super quick and food delicious and cheap. Double win.

Outdoor seating is available.
