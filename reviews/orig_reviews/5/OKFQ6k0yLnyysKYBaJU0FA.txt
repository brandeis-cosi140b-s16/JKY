We were looking for place to celebrate my moms birthday! My husband remembered this place he visited few months ago and i checked reviews on yelp and decided to give it a try. I couldn't be happier!!! Delicious Food! Live music! The most friendly customer service! We had sooo much fun!! Their guacamole is a must!! And Margaritas are the best!!! Highly recommended!!!
