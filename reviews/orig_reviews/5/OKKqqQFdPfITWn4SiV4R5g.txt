My first time eating outside of the strip in Vegas because my friend is originally from there so she took us to this restaurant. WOW! Everything from the Guacamole, salad, entree and the dessert was just AWESOME!!! We didn't get a chance to drink the margaritas but next time I'm definitely going back. It is worth the drive and also it's fun to hang out with the locals. 
Recommendations:
1. Guacamole w/Chile peppers
2. Shredded beef tortilla salad
3. Blue corn enchiladas
4. Churros with the ice cream

This places reminds me of Colibri in the city which I also highly recommend.
