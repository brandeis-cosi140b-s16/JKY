I've been to many different locations from Viva Zapatas to the Michoacana the food here has always been good for me and I highly recommend this place to anyone that wants to have that authentic Mexican food taste service is amazing and the atmosphere is extremely relaxing they have live music and they give free soup tortilla chips salsa and beans I give this place 5 stars because I've been coming here for years and every time they live up to them stars so if you're out looking for a good authentic Mexican place to eat choose this place
