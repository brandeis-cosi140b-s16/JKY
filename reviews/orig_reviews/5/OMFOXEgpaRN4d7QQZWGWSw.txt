An hour long wait doesn't keep anybody away from CFT.  You put your name on the list and they text you when you're table is ready (bonus - they send you a link right away so you can check the status of the waitlist).  We enjoyed our wait across the street at Growlers Pourhouse.  

Once we were seated, our water and drinks arrived very quickly.  What happened next is still an amazing mystery.  We put in our taco order and no less than five minutes later, it all came out.  It was incredible!  Four of us each ordered a duo of CFT signature tacos.  I had the BBQ Mahi and Lemon Shrimp.  The Lemon Shrimp wins between those two hands down.  It is so light and refreshing and perfectly lemony.  The BBQ Mahi is delicious too but on the heavier side with the creamy BBQ sauce.  And my classic margarita washed it all down wonderfully.
