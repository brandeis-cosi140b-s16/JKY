My husband and I found this restaurant through Yelp's reviews as we were looking for Mexican food off of the Strip. This was, by far, the best Latino food that we have ever had. The atmosphere was great and everyone working there greeted us warmly and were very friendly throughout. There was a Mariachi band playing, but not too loud, and everything just felt comfortable. The decor was bright and festive, but it was not over the top. The thing that we noticed first was that almost everyone eating there was Latino, and that, to us, is always a good sign of authentic food. The food did not disappoint. Everything was so good overall that we came back the next day for lunch before heading back home-- just to get another taste of it. The best of what we tried: the oysters (I am not a fan but my husband ate the heck out of them happily), the cheese fundo, and the guacamole. The warm, homemade tortillas were the best tortillas I have ever had as well, and if I could somehow magically have them at my house every day, I would be eating a steady diet of them. All in all, a good value for the money, a nice experience, and wonderful food.
