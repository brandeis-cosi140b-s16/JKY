I have been eating here for almost 30 years and it has remained a family favorite the entire time. The food and service is consistently very good. If you are looking for good, authentic Mexican food this is the place to go. Everything on the menu is simply delicious. I am not a fan of mild salsa, but I am addicted to the hot red & the hot chunky.
