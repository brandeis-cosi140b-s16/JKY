Just like goin' home to Albuquerque.

The same kitchy decor including the aqua-backlit Corona candelabra.  The great chili, green and red.  Home made tortillas.  Flavors that you won't find anywhere else West of Gallup.  

Yes, it is loud.  Yes, the floors are sticky from clumsy, half-drunk ASU patrons late on a Saturday night.  But the patio is a cool place to drink a pitcher while gazing at the stars and waiting for a table.  

The enchilada dinner is stacked like a proper plate should be.  The chorizo and bean appetizer is unusual.  And they even have soapapillas!

And if you think their chili is hot, wait till you get to New Mexico and try some of the real deal from Hatch!  I'd rate Los Dos as medium on a New Mexico scale and blow-your-head-off on either a California or Texas scale.
