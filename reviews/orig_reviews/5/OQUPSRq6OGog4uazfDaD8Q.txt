Typical, run-of-the-mill Mexican food is easy to find these days, as almost every shopping center has a family owned Mexican restaurant. However, it is hard to find a place like Vida, which features upscale, delicious Mexican food. Personally, I love their guacamole, which is made table side (worried about Mayo, no problem) and their patio seating, which overlooks one of the busiest intersections in town and is fabulous for people watching! I also the freshness of the food, the deliciousness of the skinny margaritas, and the friendliness of the staff - I've never had a bad experience here. I can't wait for the weather to warm up again so I can head to Vida's patio!
