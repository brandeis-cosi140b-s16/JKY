Hubby and I decided to go check this one out for lunch today, it's close to our office and in a development with Oregano's, BLD, among others. WOW.  We love the atmosphere, they have alot of outdoor seating, fireplace, twinkling lights.  Very nice.We sat at the bar, shared an appetizer, service from the 2 young ones behind the bar was excellent and the food portions were massive.  Parking could get a bit tough during Happy Hour and evening given the number of other restaurants and businesses there but that wouldn't stop us from going again.  I think this will be one of our new hangouts! Fresh chips and great salsa were also a bonus!  You won't be disappointed here!
