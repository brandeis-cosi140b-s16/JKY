"Amazing!"
"Delicious!"
"Best tacos I've ever had!"

Is what critics are saying. Or, maybe that just my taste buds. Either way, Braddah's Island Style is an absolutely amazing place. The second you walk in the door you are greeted by everyone working with a boisterous 'Aloha!'. Then, the samples. They let you sample the three types of meat they have. Pork, which has a little kick at the end. Steak, which is surprisingly juicy with a hint of sweetness. And, chicken, which is very hearty and tangy with just the right amount of spices.

My friend and I both opted for the steak. He got a bowl, I got three tacos with all the fixins. Also, try some of their house made sauces mango, pineapple habanero, raspberry gave jalepeno, or kiwi lime jalepeno. All are great! When you check in you can redeem an offer for free bark as well. Also, be sure to try one of the canned Hawaiian sun drinks, green tea lychee. Best drink ever. Will definitely be coming back!
