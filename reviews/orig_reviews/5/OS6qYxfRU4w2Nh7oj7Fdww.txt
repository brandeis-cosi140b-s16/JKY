Seriously...if you haven't been here stop reading this review and just head over. You can thank me later. Not only do they have the best combinations you never thought of, but you can also sample everything on the menu before ordering. If you don't know what something is, just ask for a sample. 

The ordering takes a little getting used to, but once they walk you through it a few times you'll be an old pro. The red chicken is my favorite and they can guide you on fan favorites also. Bring your appetite because you'll be full when you leave. 

For two people with drinks just a hair over $20.00, sounds like a place for me. The atmosphere is not some swanky place and all the cutlery is plastic, but aren't those the best places anyway? Last but not least one cookie per order to round out your meal...Snicker doodle.  #boom
