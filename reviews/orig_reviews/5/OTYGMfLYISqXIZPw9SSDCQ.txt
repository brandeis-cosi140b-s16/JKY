Service: 5 stars! Best waiter we've had in Phoenix in a while. Also, the happy hour margarita was one of the best I've had in the Valley.  Every person from the valet to the hostess to the guy who drove us back to the valet in a golf cart was incredibly nice.

Ambiance: 5 stars! Wonderful gem of a restaurant. Not too crowded, not over themed. Just right. Elegant without too much pretension.

Food: 4 stars - excellent food, very well prepared, decent sizes, but it didn't blow either of us away.  

Price - surprisingly decent for a fancy restaurant with 3 drinks between the two of us.  I wouldn't call it inexpensive or affordable, but I was surprised that we didn't pay much more!

The five star review is mostly for the service. I can't say enough good things about how warmly we were welcomed.  We'll be back for sure!
