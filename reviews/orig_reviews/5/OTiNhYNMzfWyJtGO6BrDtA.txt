Best tortas!

The menu is pretty diverse.  Just about every torta can also come in burrito or taco form as well. There is enough meat on one taco for two!

Great family run place where everyone pitches in.  On different occasions, I've seen the husband, grandfather, and grandmother in the kitchen.

A little while ago they switched from chips to fries... personally, I liked the chips better because they dip in the salsas easier... and speaking of salsas, watch out for the green stuff! It looks like guac but will knock your socks off.
