Frank & Lupe's is a family favorite and has now become my boyfriend and my go to Mexican restaurant when the craving strikes. The atmosphere is really charming and the waitstaff are really friendly. The salsa here is awesome! And the chips are homemade- definitely a treat. We're huge fans of the fish tacos and the creamy chicken enchiladas.
