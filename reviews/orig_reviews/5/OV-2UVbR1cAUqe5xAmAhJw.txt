I came across Joyride about a month ago and had it bookmarked with intentions to try very,very soon. Then i saw it in the New Time, "Best of 2013" and made it mandatory to get out here pronto! I was sucked in light a moth to a light as soon as we sat down. The atmosphere is so inviting and comfortable..like hanging out in a friends cool backyard.

Started off with a cup or tortilla soup and Cheese y mas ( warm melted cheesy goodness), both of which were spot on.

Me and my lover boy shared the fried fish taco & braised beef taco and he went all in for The Beast burrito and i went for the cochinita pibil torta. Let me tell you something, Im not usually a totra kinda girl but I switched it up yesterday & Im glad i did because the damn torta rocked my taste buds. We both had leftovers but devoured the rest as a late night snack. 

Oh yeah, please do try the daily freshly made aguas frescas. 
Recommendation: Cucumber Mint spiked with tequila. ( Hey, i felt somewhat healthy while drinking it)
