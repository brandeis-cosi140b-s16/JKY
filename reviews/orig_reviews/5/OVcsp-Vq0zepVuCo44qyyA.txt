I absolutely love this place, it really is the "perfect place to day drink!" The service is always amazing, the food is even better!!! I have yet to have on thing on the menu that I didn't like. Try the Pork Chile Dip to start, finish with some Crispy Tacos...or for something lighter the Chipotle Chicken Salad is BOMB. Everyone there is always trying to have a good time, you won't be disappointed!
