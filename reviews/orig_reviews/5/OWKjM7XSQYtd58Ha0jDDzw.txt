My favorite Mexican restaurant in Vegas. Chili Verde is unreal, you could put that sauce on styrofoam and I'd eat it. Enchiladas Verde is almost always on special and my gf gets it every time. Enchiladas de camaron are delicious. 

They have a small tiki bar in back featuring some awesome rum based cocktails, try the Ryan's Redbird. 

Good beans and rice come with most entrees. Avocado and tomatoes are always super fresh.
