Keeping this brief..


Went for lunch on Monday after a co-workers recommendation and was blown away by how good the Cochinita Pibil Burro was.  The pork shoulder is marinated in achiote, orange and a bunch of other stuff and was unbeleivably tender.  Great tortillas as well.  My Mexican buddy declared it some of the best meat he has ever eaten.

The salsa bar had some pretty interesting stuff in it and everything I tried was great, including marinated onions and two different salsa verdes.  A plus was the Pico was pretty spicy, with large chunks of Jalapeno in it.  

I will definitely be back.
