A true gem that helps us 'gringos' understand that the Mexican menu is a beautiful tapestry that  extends beyond our Chimichanga laden imagination. Superb Oaxacan style street food that captures the essence of one the best culinary regions in the world. All they need now is to replace that nearby bar with an open area to showcase some voladores de papantla in the parking lot.

My recommendation is to try all of the dishes that you won't normally find in your traditional Mexican joints.  Things like the Tlayuda.
