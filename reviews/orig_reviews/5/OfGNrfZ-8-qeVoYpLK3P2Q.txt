When I first drove past this place I wasn't too sure about it. I looked it up on Yelp and I saw that it had pretty good reviews, so I decided to try it out. I love it! I usually get the California Burrito and a medium drink which comes out to about $5.60. The burrito is a decent size too. Totally recommend this place if your in the mood for some Mexican food.
