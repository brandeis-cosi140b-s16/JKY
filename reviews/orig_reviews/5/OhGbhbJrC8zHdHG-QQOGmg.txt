Awesome food. My favorite is the bean, rice, and cheese chimi. It's delicious! They are a bit pricey, but worth it. They could totally have a great chain if they would expand, but I don't think it's ever going to happen. My husband has been going here (it's a house, in a neighborhood, with some picnic tables on the side of the house) since he was a kid growing up in that neighborhood.
