I always go for Happy Hour...then again every hour is every hour ...lol seriously though they have one of the best carne asada in the Valley. Juicy, tender, and not fatty at all. And ive had my share of carne asada. I am mexican. You will not be disappointed. Street tacos which are mini tacos. You get 4 for only $4!! at happy hour time...Margaritas are decent..Carnitas are amazing as well. Best place for tacos for me. 

**Update- I continue to come here. Never disappoints. I noticed prices went down on a few items. Like there carna asada plate. use to be $17! Now its $12 i believe and you get more food with it. Thats a huge plus. Was just there a couple days ago. Margaritas are always tasty. On the rocks please! Love Manuel's!
