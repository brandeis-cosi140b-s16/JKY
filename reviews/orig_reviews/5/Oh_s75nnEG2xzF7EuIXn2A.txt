It's hard to tell others about this place.  At least the people I know.  I get one of two responses:

"You order a SANDWICH at a Mexican restaurant?"

Yes, a sandwich.  It's not weird.  It's not even unique.  It's a sandwich.  You put turkey on yours.  They put ham, hot dog, carne, egg, chorizo, guacamole, mayo, and pico on theirs.  Okay, maybe it's unique.  At the very least, it's better than that quesadilla you're ordering.  But go right ahead.  More torta for me!

"SUNNYSLOPE?"

Yes, Sunnyslope.  I don't shoot meth.  I've never picked up a hooker.  Yeah, there's a lot of Mexicans.  But I'm Mexican, so maybe I should be offended that you pointed it out.  No, it's not scary.  You don't need to lock your car door as badly as you think you do.

Torta Kings, you had me at, "breaded beef."
