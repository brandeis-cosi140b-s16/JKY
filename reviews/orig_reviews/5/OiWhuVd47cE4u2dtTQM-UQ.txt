Had breakfast here twice in the past two weeks...that's how yummy it is. Had the same waitress both times. She was very nice. Had the Chorizo and Egg breakfast minus the rice and add the potatoes. Their breakfast potatoes are super yummy. The second visit we did wait quite some time for our food...but to our surprise they removed a meal from our ticket for the inconvenience without us asking!!!That's what I call 5 star!!! Will make this a regular place to visit. Also can't wait to come back and sit out on the patio one evening!!
