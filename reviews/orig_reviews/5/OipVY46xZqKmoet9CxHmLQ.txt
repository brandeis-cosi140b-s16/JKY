I am addicted to the Bean Burro, to the tune of once a week.  This is also in my neighborhood, so I want to support them as much as I can.  This food is NOT fast-food Mexican, nor is it typical greasy Sonoran.  The menu is small, but tasty.  In addition to the bean burro, I highly recommend the ceviche (weekends), the carne asada, and the salsas.  For a more genuine experience, order a Margarita, Mexican coke, or one of the fruit drinks made fresh on the premises.  Sit outside, enjoy the weather, bob your head to the music, and all will be well....I promise.
