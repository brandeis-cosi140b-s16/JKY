I eat at Hussongs Cantina each time I travel to Las Vegas, and it keeps getting better and better. From the delicious margaritas with real lime juice ( no machines or blenders), to amazing fried artichoke salad and pork tacos. This place is a MUST when in Vegas. Prices are great for the amount of yummy food you get. The mariachi band is fantastic and plays all kinds of fun music. Great for parties, bachelorette/bachelor parties or just watching sports in the bar with all the tvs. If you want true, authentic mexican food, HUSSONGS Cantina is your go to place in Vegas. 
Cheers!
