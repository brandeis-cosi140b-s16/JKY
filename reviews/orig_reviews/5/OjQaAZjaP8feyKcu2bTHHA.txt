We flew into Phoenix from Jfk and looked for a place for lunch on our way north.  We were of course looking for something local but simple. 
We used our yelp app and ended up at the Chino Bandido.  The food was great.  It's a fusion of Mexican and Chinese, leaning toward the Mexican.  We walked in and were greeted with an offer for samples.  Each offering was a unique explosion of flavor and spice.   Great food and a really simple atmosphere. 
 You order up front at the counter and then grab your drink and head to a table.  The food is delivered on a tray in a tin pan, but you don't mind because after that first bite you're hooked. 
 It fit the bill and we left stuffed and with a smile on our faces.
