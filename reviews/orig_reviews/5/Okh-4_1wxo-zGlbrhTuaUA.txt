This place does street style corn better than I've ever had! I've even had park street corn from a guy with a cart and a bike horn and this place blew it away! I stopped in for a quick bite, ordered two carne asada tacos and the corn. The steak was delicious! Much better than the chewy stuff at other places. I didn't have time to try a specialty fruit drink but the staff was friendly and patient as they let a lady sample all of them...SMH. This place has charm, they're slogan suggests they have a sense of humor (How you bean?), and they close on Sunday keeping the Sabbath day holy! Great place, I can't wait to go back with my wife and kids! Nice job Arturo Trejo!
