Today was the 1st time that i enjoyed Rito's at the Surprise location.  I usually get take out from their downtown location.  I will say that Surprise did not disappoint.  The green chile burrito enchilada style was on point. So so good.  Everything is so fresh. Helen was very nice.  My family and i will be back.  it is great to have this food on the Westside.
