Best Mexican spot in Phoenix. Hands down.

 Best parts about Mi Patio:
-service. You can be seated, ordered, eat ad leave within 45 minutes, and that is with the free shot they sometimes give you!
-price. You can go to plenty of other highly rated places and pay double the price....and this is better food.
-fam owned-most of the people have worked there forever. They remember the regulars orders (and this place is so good there are a lot of regulars)

Favorite Food:
-beef tacos-delicious. You can request with onions and tomatoes otherwise it comes with lettuce and cheese. I recommend #96-two tacos, beans and cheese. Mixing the beans together and adding a little hot sauce on top is delicious. **if you order this for pickup or to go it is a $1 cheaper by the way!** #106 Is another good combo.
-Baja chicken burro. Oh my god delicious. This dish is all about the sauce. It goes so well together. **you can ask for the sauce on anything I learned by the way
-chips and salsa are constantly being replenished and are so yummy and homemade 

If I had to find negatives/to be straight up:
-not my favorite guacamole. Not a lot of flavor.
-quesadillas aren't always that crispy
-margs aren't the strongest or made with the too ingredients but they are cheap and still yummy. Ask for a double with not too much ice!

This is by far the best Mexican food I have found in AZ. I never leave disappointed. The food is great ad you any best the service and prices.
