Found this place on yelp. 

Super great location, a mile from our house. I love that they have a full, and I do mean FULL, bar. Their tequila selection is impressive, to say the least!! Our bar tender, Jose, was incredible! Very attentive, gave us all kinds of samples, really friendly!! Their food, also incredible!! We tried the al pastor taco (meat, onions, cilantro and pineapple)...not a huge pork fan, but it was super tasty! Also tried one of their carne Asada bowls, yummy!! The one downside of the bowl was the cheese. It was pretty much the Kraft shredded fiesta mix you can buy at the grocery store. The carne Asada was great though!! Not fatty and very flavorful. My girlfriend got the chips and guacamole. Not a huge fan myself, but was definitely impressed. The guacamole was filled with cilantro and chunks of tomato. The chips were homemade and warm when they came out.

Overall, was very impressed and can't wait to come back again!!!
