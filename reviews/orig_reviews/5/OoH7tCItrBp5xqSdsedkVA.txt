Excellent experience, definitely beyond expectations.  This was largely due to my server, Vikki, who's timing was better than many an upscale restaurant I've visited!  She suggested a cocktail upon her introduction, an expected upsell in an establishment like this.  When I requested water with no ice and lemon she showed no disappointment and had it on my table in less than a minute.  Before it was half empty, there was another waiting on the table for me.  I ordered a carnitas breakfast burrito, which came out very quickly and was certainly tasty!  The salsa served with the dish was very mild, but there's a bottle of Cholula on every table so heat may be added to taste.  The check came at the perfect time, when I was almost finished with my meal.  Even after paying my bill and leaving tip, Vikki came by asking if I'd like more water - a rarity in my experience.  Highly recommended!!
