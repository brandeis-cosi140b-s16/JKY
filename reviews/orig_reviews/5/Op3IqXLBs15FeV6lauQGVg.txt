WOW!! WHAT A WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE! Service- 5 stars! Food- 5 stars! Atmosphere/cleanliness- 5 stars! We really could not have had a better time here. We were quickly welcomed at the door by the manager, and immediately brought to our table. This place is run like a well-oiled machine. You can tell every employee works together and is busting their ass, without making you feel as if you're being rushed so they can flip a table. I've never seen so many employees smiling. It's as if they enjoyed what they were doing.  What a concept! I'll definitely attribute it to the Mexican culture that prides hardwork while enjoying life attitude. Inspiration for us all. Among the many highlights were our beautiful server Angelica, the incredibly delicious handmade corn and flour tortillas, and the intoxicating salsa.  This is everything you hope for in a sit-down Mexican restaurant. Would love to give more details, but uhh I got a life to live ;-). Will definitely be back soon. Next Saturday sounds good. Angelica here we come!
