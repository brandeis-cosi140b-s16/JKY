Good fresh food.  Not authentic mexican hawaiian food but a decent fusion.   I had the chicken, pork, and steak taco.  All meats were very good.   I tried all the salsas and they were all good as well. The pineapple one was probably best. Would have liked more options for maybe a salsa fresca or similar.   Otherwise everything was great.  Would have been better if tortillas were made fresh on site but they were still good. I liked the whole wheat taco tortillas.  Most places dont have whole wheat option for tacos.

Staff were all very friendly and helpful.   Will definitely go back.
