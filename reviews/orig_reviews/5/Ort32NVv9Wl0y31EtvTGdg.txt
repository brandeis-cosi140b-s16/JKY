Best Burrito I've ever had. They have all these different meat choices, which they'll happily give you samples of and explain- THIS, however, makes it so difficult because each one is so amazing. You'll find yourself standing there, completely stressed and confused by the decision. HOW DO YOU PICK!? Once you finally reach a conclusion the rest is easy. The Burrito's are HUGE and VERY delicious and VERY reasonably priced. The service is top notch, very nice folks and you get to sit around in a freaking Mexican Wrestling arena-type-restaurant. 

If you come here and don't have fun there are definitely some circuits missing from your motherboard.
