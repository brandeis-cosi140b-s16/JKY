This place is one of the best Mexican restaurants that I have ever been too. Everything was great. The tableside guacamole was the best I have ever had. I had the Siegel plate with chicken and beef. It is served with onions, asparagus and rice. Delicious. My wife had tacos with pork and a mango salsa that was also great. If you check in on yelp they give you flan. And as you can probably already guess - best I have had.  This is a place you must go to. Hoping for a San Francisco place
