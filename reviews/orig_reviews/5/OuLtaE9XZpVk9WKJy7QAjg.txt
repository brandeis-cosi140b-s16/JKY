Usually on Yelp and similar sites, people either under-rate or overrate places. Well, I am here to tell you this place is worth every bit of the hype. I have NEVER had better Mole. The chicken mole enchiladas were like an orgasm in your mouth. I've been to Mexican restaurants all over the United States AND in Mexico and this is the hands down winner. The food is out of this world, the portions are huge, they have a large diverse menu, and the prices are great. Jessica was our waitress and she was OUTSTANDING! 

Since we all know that everything can't be perfect, (although in this case, it really is), I will say there was one negative (in my opinion). I was not a big fan of the mariachi band (three guys singing and playing guitar) going around to each individual table and singing to you. To some people this may be great, but I'd prefer they just staying on a stage and sang at one point in the room instead of being a foot away while I'm eating. But even this didn't bar Casa Ramos from being my favorite Mexican place ever.

Sadly, I live in Nebraska so I eat here once a year if I am lucky. Therefore, PLEASE do my a favor and go savor the deliciousness of Casa Ramos for me!
