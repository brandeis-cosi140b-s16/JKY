Love this place! Great food, huge portions! The ambiance and staff are excellent as well. Our server Joaquin was very knowledgable and recommended some great dishes! The guac he made table-side was to die for! The manager Dana was very friendly & attentive as well. 

We also tried the pastor tacos, albondigas soup, & the Siegel plate. Every single dish was delicious! Oh & their margaritas are very strong- never a bad thing :)

I will definitely be back!
