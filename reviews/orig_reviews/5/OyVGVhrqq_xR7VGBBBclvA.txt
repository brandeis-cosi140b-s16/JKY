We have been to a number of the Los Dos Molinos and have always enjoyed the food. So we were really glad to see one finally open in our side of town a few years ago. And this one does not disappoint. We have gone a number of times. Only once did we receive what we would consider poor service, and it was a new waiter who was a little slower than normal. It gave us the opportunity to enjoy our conversation, and the chips and salsa. If you are going to visit, be aware: most of the food is spicy. In case you forget, they do warn you on the menu.
