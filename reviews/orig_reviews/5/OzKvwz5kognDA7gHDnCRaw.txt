I've tried over 30 taco restaurants and trucks all over Los Angeles and San Diego plus three awful places in New York City and NOTHING tops Taco y Taco in taste. The prices were $2 at the Tropicana location 2 years ago but increased to $2.15 last year and meow $2.25 this year however the inflation in prices is more than reasonable. You will not find a nicer taco restaurant in America. The bathrooms have automatic towels and marble sinks with nice flooring. The venue has high ceilings and very spacious plus a full bar with numerous beers on tap, liquor and unique beer bottles. The other location is also clean and spacious. Plenty of salsa, lime, radish, onions and peppers to add on.
