All the Yelp hype is true. Hands down, the best carne asada burrito I've ever had. I've lived in Los Angeles. I currently live less than a mile from the vaunted taquerias of San Francisco's Mission District. This place is better. The carne asada was tender and beautifully seasoned. The tortilla was sublime, slightly toasted. And the housemade salsas... perfect! Bonus: the woman who works here is the friendliest lady I've ever met in such a place. By far. Five solid stars all the way around.
