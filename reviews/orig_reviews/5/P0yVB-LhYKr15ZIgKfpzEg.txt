If I were to choose a place to go on a romantic date in Phoenix, Rokerij would be at the top.  It also would be near the top of my list for places to bring a friend visiting Phoenix.  Honestly, Rokerij is near the top of all my lists.

Your experience begins when you head down a flight of stairs into what appears to be a small rock-walled cavern.  There are cozy chairs next to a fireplace if you want to chill with friends, romantic booths hidden away in niches (definitely reserve these in advance if you want one!) and spots at a bar where we witnessed bar staff chatting about patrons casually about life and doing everything that a bartenders do in classy places that they don't in, you know, Scottsdale.

The food is spectacular.  I tried the carne adovada and liked it, but Phoenix is full of good authentic Mexican food.  The star here for me was really the Seared Pecan Trout, which apparently is local from Arizona and wild-caught.  The fish is melt-in-your-mouth buttery with absolutely incredible flavor.  Pair it with the brussel sprouts and a glass of wine for a wonderful (and actually healthy!) meal.  We lucked out and caught a "half off bottles of wine" happy hour, but it looks like there's a good selection of cocktails on the menu as well.

10/10 would come again.
