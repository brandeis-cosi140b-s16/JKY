My Fiancee and I were contacted by the GM Tai and were asked to come back in hopes of having a better experience. I was impressed by the genuine concern that Tai expressed the first time we spoke. 

After returning for a second try my fiancee and I both felt that it was one of the best dining experiences we have ever had. The food and service from start to finish was fantastic!

 A few highlights: 
Tuna and Yellow Tail Sashimi- Great cut, fresh
Pomegranate Gauc -Awesome... again! 
Suzuki Roll- Delicious, sauce was amazing 
** Wild Mushroom tacos- I must say this was my favorite part of the dinner! 
Shaking Beef-  This was my fiancee's favorite! The meat was super tender, flavorful and the perfect amount of spice! 
Summer Corn- Light and flavorful and the popcorn on top was a fun touch.

We will definitely be returning and would highly recommend to anyone.
