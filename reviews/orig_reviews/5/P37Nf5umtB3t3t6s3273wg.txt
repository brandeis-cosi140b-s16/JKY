This place was excellent. Can we begin by talking about the Frida Khalo decor? It's so awesome to see such a great artist to be their center of atmosphere. On that note, the music was great. A little surprised they don't have a dance floor for later in the evening. 

Let's talk food. Holy crap. If you eat here, you will not be disappointed. Everything is seasoned to perfection and the portions will definitely fill you right up! This place had authentic delicious Mexican food. Oh, and the margaritas are of the chain, on the rocks or blended.  Thumbs up!
