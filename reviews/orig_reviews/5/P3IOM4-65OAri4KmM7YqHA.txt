For starters we had guacamole, queso fundido, and tortilla chips. There were 3 of us. Each had different entr√©es.. Tortilla soup with flour tortillas on the side, shrimp tacos, and mahi-mahi grilled fish tacos. We each the house specialty charro beans. Everything was excellent. Will return soon for their happy hour 3-6 Sun-Fri.
