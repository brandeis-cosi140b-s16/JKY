MIND BLOWN!!! 

umm... yea... OK... so it's just a taco place.... NO!! it is like AMAZEBALLZ taco place!! My theory for all Mexican food is... the more ghetto the place looks... the better it freaken tastes!! That is WHY street food made from a cart is so delicious. This place is not the most fanciest looking place... but they do a darn good job keeping the place constantly clean. 

HONESTLY... the employees look angry & mean... but they are freaken NICE!! they just literally have no time to smile because they are cooking & taking orders at the same time... plus never having a moment to breathe w/ all the people they see in front of them! *bravo bravo * but once it slows down they all start to relax & smile... especially the third time you order from them... 

Three different lines to order your food based on what you want. I went around 1 am on a Sunday night & the lines were to the end of the booths. Everything here is made from SCRATCH!! Everything is well priced *as in cheap!* Pretty much the ingredients are all basic & similar... just simple goodness...

TACO DE LENGUA $2 - the most TENDER cow tongue that I have put on my toungue Hahaaha just melts into your mouth. Served on 2 small corn tortilla w/ salsa verde & chopped onions.

TACO DE ADOBADA $2.25 - perfect amount of spicyness on corn tortilla  accommodated w/ cilantro sauce, red sauce, & onions. You can also asked for grilled pineapples. 

TACO DE ASADA $2 - the beef was not as tender as I would normally like it but still good! Topped w/ salsa & smashed avocado 

CORN MULA W/ ADOBADA $4 - corn tortilla sandwich in a sense & adobada is the same thing as al pastor (something new I just learned)  =P  

FLOUR MULA W/ ADOBADA $4 - much PREFERRED the flour tortilla for the mulas. Such soft chest goodness especially when you watch them press the dough right in front of your face & then cook it on the flat top topped w/ cheese on each tortilla. PLUS I added avocado ... OMG de-ri-cious!!

SOPES W/ ASADA $4 - thick DOUGHY texture hand made corn tortilla  on the bottom w/ crispy corn tortilla on top & asada, avocado, & salsa in between. 

TOSTADA W/ AL PASTOR $2 - CRUNCHY goodness!! 2 crispy tortillas filled w/ al pastor, cilantro sauce, & red sauce.
