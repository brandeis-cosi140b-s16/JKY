The first thing that Gallo Blanco has going for it is a certain type of cool. A little off the beaten path, this restaurant in the Clarendon gets a pretty diverse crowd, all drawn to the great food and drinks. 

I'm usually a beer guy and with Negro Modelo on draft they score a big win in the beer department. Amongst the apps I've had are the corn, guacamole and house salad, all are excellent. But the real show (heart) stopper is the chicharron de queso (had to check their website for the spelling). The best way to describe it is like the cheese that falls onto the pan when you're drunk and making a quesadilla, you eat it and decide that maybe the crispy cheese would make a pretty good meal on its own. Well, the good people at GB have taken this 3am marvel and turned it into something bigger, better, and brought dipping sauce. Probably best to order for four people, or not eat the whole thing (a little greasy) but definitely worth a try.

Without question, my favorite item is the carne asada torta. No joke, awesome, life altering, eat one and wish you had another, great. Every time the wife and I are staring down an $83 dinner bill for mediocre food at some other place, I usually create a fantasy that I had dropped 8 bucks for one of these instead.
