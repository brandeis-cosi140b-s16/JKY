I've been going to Pedro's for years.. I love going there for their lunch specials. Their service is so good and fast that I can always count on getting in and out when I'm on a time crunch. Be sure to ask for the hot chunky salsa, I think it's by request only. I usually mix it with the mild to make the perfect salsa. The shredded beef tacos are great. Also, I've enjoyed their dinner menu on several occasions - I highly recommend the San Marcos Burrito!
