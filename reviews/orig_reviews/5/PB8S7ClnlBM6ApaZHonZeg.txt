WOW. 

Coming here after a night of drinking was a life changing, food experience. Everybody in the place was Spanish, so you know it's authentic. Maybe it was a good thing that they started speaking to me in their native language even though I didn't understand a dam thing cause I don't want the Gringo treatment.

Make sure you get into the correct line. Go to the right for adobada, and the left for everything else. Some chica cut in front of me only to be told to move over (that's what you get, HA). All I said was "two", and the cook asked if I wanted everything on them. Of course! After warming the corn tortillas in some fat, He sliced some meat off of the rotating spit (the same kind they cook gyro meat on), and speedily added the onions, cilantro, and a green sauce. Spicy, greasy, crunchy, creamy...complete taco perfection. Hands down the best I've had.
