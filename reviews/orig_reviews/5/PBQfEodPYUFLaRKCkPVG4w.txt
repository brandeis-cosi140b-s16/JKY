Had four meals here in three days. 2 dollars a taco. These seem authentic. Each order comes with a plate with hot peppers and green onion. Really notches up the spice. Limes and horseradish sides by the pop and straws. My favorites were the steak and spicy pork. Beef shoulder wasn't nearly as good...a little more dry.

Each comes with guac, usually a condiment specific to the taco you get, onion, cilantro. 

If you want to really treat yourself, arrive when they open at 1030 AM and get the steak fresh to order. Great to have an alternative to the over-priced/under-valued food options on the strip.

Highly recommend!
