First visit to Gilbert's new downtown Barrio Queen Mexican restaurant. Excellent Cochinita Pibil tacos!! Two for $3 during Happy Hour. And the chips and marinated pulled pork Carnitas Chile Verde are mild, smooth and delicious. Be sure to top it off with their Casa Margaritas!! Add some of their red sauce to the Chile Verde and it will be perfect! Just enough kick!!!
