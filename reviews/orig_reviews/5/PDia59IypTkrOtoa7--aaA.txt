First time here. Nice service. Tasty delicious goodies. Chips and salsa and guacamole for free. Very yum. Had the bulgogi beef plate added the Kim Che rice. Super good. Nice flavor and sweetness on the beef and the flavorful taste of the kimchee in the fried rice was so delicious. My girl had the fusion flautas.  Bulgogi and mozzarella inside a fried tortilla with an amazing Korean hot sauced guacamole.  Really flipping good. Good eats will be back.
