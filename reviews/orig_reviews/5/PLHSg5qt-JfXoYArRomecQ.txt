Outstanding!  Our group is from Texas so we were pretty hesitant to go to a Mexican restaurant in Vegas since we have great ones all around us at home.  I couldn't be happier that we decided to go to Casa Don Juans anyway. The chips and corn and flour tortillas are all made great fresh, and the salsa, been dip, guacamole, and queso were delicious. The cheese enchilada was one of the best I have had, made with cheddar instead of American cheese with a tangy housemade red sauce. 

The carnitas, steak ranchero, and burritos were also all huge hits. And the servers were all helpful, nice, attentive, and generally great. An all around great experience. 

One caveat, don't walk there from the strop or downtown. Pretty long walk through a somewhat shady looking neighborhood, take a cab and you're set.
