I have never taken the time to write a review until now. I consider myself a strong critic of Mexican food, because I'm from California, and have eaten at many authentic "hole in the walls" This place is truly a hidden gem!  My family and I had several dishes including the whole red snapper, shrimp culuchi I and carne asada all where excellent.  This will surely be a stop of mine every time I visit Phoenix.
