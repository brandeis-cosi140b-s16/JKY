I thought I was being boring by ordering just a 'plain' cheeseburger and fries; however, the food was anything but that! The cheeseburger was delicious and had all kinds of yummy toppings: cucumbers, pickled radishes, a special sauce, and my choice of cheese. Even the bun was delish! The fries were seasoned perfectly as well. I think I ate every single bite of my food. The staff was excellent-super fast and helpful. I would definitely recommend this place to everyone, and I can't wait to come back to Scottsdale for more! :)
