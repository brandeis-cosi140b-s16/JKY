Let me start by saying the food is really great. As a vegetarian, finding a Mexican restaurant that I have many dishes to choose from is great. We started with table side guacamole and it was delicious. We followed this up with cheese enchiladas. The sauce was flavorful and had a kick. I would recommend the food to anyone. On a side note, the decor is great and the service was spot on. Kudos....
