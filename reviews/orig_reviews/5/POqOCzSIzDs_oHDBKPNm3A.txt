Hilary is the best manager ever, if you have an issue see her. 

Christina the bartender is the best, she is there to serve and OH so hot. She has your beer down before you even you know.

Guillermo, what can I say. He backs up Christina and the two of them will make your day/night. Both can mix a strong drink.

Love this place!
