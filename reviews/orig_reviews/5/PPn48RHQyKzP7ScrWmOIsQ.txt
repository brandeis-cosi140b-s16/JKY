This is what Phoenix should be known for.  Come in, and find a cool, dark comfy spot (the best show is at the bar, where you will watch the master chef assemble your feast) with some of the best New Mexican cuisine you have even heard of. Get the Richardson's combo of Jalape√±o Benedict and Enchiladas, or better yet, the best non-mom Meatloaf a la Vic. You WILL be back, so do not worry that everything looks delicious; order the first thing that catches your fancy (adovada if you cannot decide), then get the next thing tomorrow, and the next thing the day after that... Get a drink, sit back, and await the love your tastebuds will receive.
