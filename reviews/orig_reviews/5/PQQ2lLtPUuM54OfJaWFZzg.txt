From LA and was recommended to eat here by several friends. Wow! Best mexican meal ever! Need this place back home. The staff was fantastic and on their game the whole time! Juan Carlos was our host and made our dining experience incredible, what a professional! Now to the food! I dined with 5 family members and we were all blown away! We all had various dishes from basic fare to seafood and none disappointed. The tamales were the best i ever had, so moist they melted in my mouth. So many good things to say about this place! YOU MUST TRY THIS PLACE! 10 stars!
