This little burger joint really stole my heart... or should I say stomach? This small burger "stand" was pretty busy early on Saturday night and I can see why.  I found the service/atmosphere to be great.  Everyone was friendly and helpful, which is always a plus.

So, most importantly, the food. I found the burger to be perfect. The bun was soft, the meat was cooked just right.  There was a great meat to cheese ratio, and the pickles and sauce really added the right touch.  The fries were also delish.  Seasoned well and the "stand sauce" was zingy and great with the fries.  Didn't have shake, but I'll be back to try one of these bad boys soon.  Almost everyone around us has one and they all looked great.  I also had a bite of the short rib taco, which was good, but for me the burger is where it was at.

Definitely be talking about this place for awhile. It's a good thing for my waistline it's not too close to home...
