This was one of the best Mexican restaurants we've been to. All four people at our table raved about their dinners. Our server, Melissa, was extremely helpful with our questions about the menu: how spicy items are, whether items were totally gluten free or now, etc. I prefer dishes with a kick and the Las Cruces Kabobs hit the spot. Jalapeno Hollandaise over a very generous serving of fish kabobs, served with rice, beans and sauteed vegetables, done to perfection. Next time we are back in Scottsdale we will definitely return to Blue Adobe Grille.
