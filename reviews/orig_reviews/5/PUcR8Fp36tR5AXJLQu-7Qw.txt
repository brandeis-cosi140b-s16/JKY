Breaking....my New Year's resolution.
So this year's resolution was to eat healthier and to rid myself from any kind of addicted dependency but how can I do it when there's a f 'kng taco dealer in almost every corner here in Vegas? Specially tacos El Gordo where they can hook you up  with the purest and tastiest al pastor, asada , lengua and tripas tacos. So delicious and so addicting you would think that Walter White was actually doing all the cooking for you.
 Service is great friendly and efficient, the place is also very clean there's always an employee going around picking up trays and cleaning tables since this place is always packed with taco junkies. Every time I feel the urge to move to Colorado I stop at tacos El Gordo to remind myself of a reason to stay in Vegas. I swear nothing could beat a rolled taco with cilantro at tacos El Gordo. I only wish they were open 24 hours since is usually at the very late hours of the night when I start getting all those taco withdrawals after consuming a few spirited beverages.
They open late till 2am on weekdays and till 4 am weekends so make sure you leave the party or the club before that time so you can ingest some alcohol absorber. sometimes I get there late ( yes, I'm the one who knocks ) and end up looking for Roberto for an inferior fix.
I have tried other places and this are the tastiest and best street style tacos in town by far for the price. 
Take a break from that treadmill, throw those diet pills away and get yourself some antacids instead and drive to tacos El Gordo right now for some instant satisfaction.
Why?
 .....Because I say so!
