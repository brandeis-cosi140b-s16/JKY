Just GO!!! Some of the best food I have had in quite some time.  Don't let the minimal ambiance fool you.  We just ordered multiple items and shared.....and then ordered MORE!! The flavors are earthy, rich and complex (compliments of the Oaxaca influence).  Just go and order a variety of food and be prepared to enjoy yourself. Oh, and get the horchata...just trust me on this.
