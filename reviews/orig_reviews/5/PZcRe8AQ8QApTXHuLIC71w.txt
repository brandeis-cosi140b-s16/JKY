I literally went to this place three times in one week. DaYum it was a good week!
Delicious burger (which of course I add bacon to, cuz bacon makes everything better ;D), delicious french fries, mix that with an awesome chocolate or banana shake ( I haven't found an awesome banana one in years!) add in a little organic/local and you've got this girl! I took 3 different sets of friends and all of them had an amazing experience. We even got to chat with the owners, super friendly and beautiful couple! So excited for this little spot. If you do the drive thru it does take a little time, but that's called quality kids! Aint no body got time for crappy food! haha! Still have to try the tacos, but figured I should take a break ;)  
Happy Eating!!!
