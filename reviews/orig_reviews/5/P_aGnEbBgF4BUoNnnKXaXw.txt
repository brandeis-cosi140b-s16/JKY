literally the most deliciious mexican food in vegas. i've been to the ones toward SD area and Riverside twd the border, and this one is exactly the same. 

those carne asada fries got crack in them, cause im totally addicted and for 5 bucks, you get a wad of carne asada fries, guac, and salsa. 

tacos are made to order, and its super quick. i got my food in like 2 minutes and got 5 tacos. sometimes you gotta live mas ayy?? it can get crowded at times, but even if its a large wait, its worth it. 

the bull head in the back doe...ridiculous! hands down best mexican restaurant in vegas.
