Was going to the Mesa arts center for a concert and needed somewhere to eat first and found this on Yelp.  Thanks Yelpers !  I would never have gone in without your recommendations !  Looks a bit dodgy from the outside, but really cosy on the inside.  We were seated at the bar as the place was so busy - a great sign.  Our waitress was awesome and gave us some great recommendations. I had mushroom and beef chimis in a mushroom sauce - it was unbelievable.  My partner had fish tacos.  We will be back for sure !
