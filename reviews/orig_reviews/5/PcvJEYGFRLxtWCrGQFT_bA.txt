The Crescent Ballroom seems to metamorphose appropriately depending on the act on stage and the temperament of the crowd.  Having taken in two shows midweek on several occasions, I can only imagine how it will continue to evolve with time.

But suffice it to say that any place where the diversity of the species (musical and otherwise) can coexist in peace deserves a try, especially in SandLand.
