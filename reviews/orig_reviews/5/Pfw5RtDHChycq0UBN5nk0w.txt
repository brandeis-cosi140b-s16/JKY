Well im going to start off my first review with a really good one.  In june 2008 me and my buddy were going to an august burns red/ as i lay dying concert @ the old joint @ hard rock. We had time to kill so we ate at pink taco. I ordered the chimichanga meal. Around 12 bucks at the time but man it was awesome . Had some chipotle sauce and free chips and salsa with guac.... Awesome. And usually coronas taste a bit burnt and bitter but not here. I mean they taste really fresh and heavenly. This place is legit!
