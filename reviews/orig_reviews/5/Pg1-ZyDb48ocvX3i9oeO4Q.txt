What do people expect when they go here? Chili's? Garcias? I digress, more flan and Chili Relleno's for me. This is an actual Mexican restaurant people. Meaning what Mexican people would eat. If you want the same colby jack drenched mediocre eating experience go somewhere else. There are plenty of them. 

I've been going here for over 16 years in different locations in downtown Tempe. The same waitresses Lydia and Angie are still there. This seems like going to someone's home to have dinner their grandmother made from time honored recipes. 

The Claire Burrito is worth it by itself, but my recommendation is the Thursday lunch special, Chicken Mole. White or dark your choice. As are whole or refried beans. Only queso fresco here (fresh cheese for the Spanish impaired), no boring cheese whiz like coating. And that makes all the difference in the cheese enchiladas which are to die for. So much more healthy and tasty, and very uncommon unfortunately. The tortillas are far better than virtually any other place I've tried. Fresh and good enough to eat by themselves.

The salsa is a cooked blended salsa that is what I prefer. Pico De Gallo? get that at Chili's or Macayo's. I agree the chips could be thinner, but they hold up to the salsa well. And I believe that is their purpose. They've been that way forever and it wouldn't be the same any other way. If fact nothing has changed, and that puts a smile on my face every time. May it always stay that way!
