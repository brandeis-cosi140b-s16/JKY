This is by far the best mexican restaurant my husband and I have had in AZ. The chips and salsa are delicious. He always orders the chipotle cream shrimp and I like to change it up. I can't complain about their shrimp cocktails, enchiladas, molcajete, or shrimp dishes. Everything is delicious. Love the margaritas! And micheladas! Service is great too.

Highly recommend this place!
