Read the other YELP reviews & saw they were open on Sundays, so we headed right over to satisfy our craving for Mexican food.  Better than the reviews said!  The chips arrive warm & the salsa is great, not so spicy that all you taste is the heat.  Our server was friendly & the food was amazing.  We are already planning what to order "next time"!
