Me and my wife stopped in on the recommendations of yelp. I would just like to say thank you!  I have not found this authentic flavor in Tennessee yet. 

We had the brunch with margaritas and buffet. I usually don't like either, but t his was spectacular. 

I had the goat with rice, beans and rice. My wife had the chicken with rice. The only thing I did not like was the tripe soup but that was because of the tripe not the flavor. Everything was delicious. 

Make sure you check it out if you get a chance.
