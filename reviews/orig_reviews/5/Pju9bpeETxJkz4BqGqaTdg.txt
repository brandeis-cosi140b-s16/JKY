Rito's Mexican food is as good as it gets. Literally "hole in the wall" kind of place. Everything made is fresh and made to order. The bean burrito enchilada style is what I always get and it's awesome. When they have tacos, those too are really good, some of the best I've had. This is a go to place if you're in the area and just want a quick lunch. Great people and amazing food!
