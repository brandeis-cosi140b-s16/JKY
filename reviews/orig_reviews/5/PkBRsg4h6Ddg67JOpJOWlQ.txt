I love this place. I come here often. This borsht is awesome. The pelmeni and vareniki are great. The price that they are charging and the amount you get is awesome. I come here every couple days to eat lunch and dinner. The owner is very nice. He comes to every table to make sure every th ing is great. 
I really recommend to every person at least ro come ones and see what kind of service and food they have. I usually don't smoke Hookah but when they made it for me for free just to try I was amazed. I become a Hookah person. Green dacha is the best place in town
