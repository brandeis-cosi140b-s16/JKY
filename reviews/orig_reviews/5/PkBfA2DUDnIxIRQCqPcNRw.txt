This is one of those places that I like to stop by right after I get to veags when I'm not in the mood yet to start partying or going to a nice restaurant.

very cheap and quick food, that tastes pretty damn good as well! lines can get a bit long but they move fast, outdoor and indoor seating, parking lot faces encore/wynn
