This is literally the best meal i have ever had (no exaggeration). I got a lobster tail with a filet on the side (amazing, the lobster had a tequila sauce). They make guacamole right next to the table. The place manages to do authentic Mexican food in a classy way; most places can only do one or the other well. The margaritas are delicious. Also we brought a family of 8 and they sat us (the place is small so it took a while) but everyone agreed, hands down the best food we've ever eaten. Every time i go back i love it. Way better food than taco guild or other pretenders out there! Im almost sorry to give them such a good review because they may get too busy!
