Very Filling!! Never have had New Mexican style food (born in the Midwest, out here on work assignment) and it was delicious! Cooked to order, and was a big portion!

Ordered the Green Chili Pork Breakfast Burrito, with extra eggs, and was amazed at how much food I received for $7 total! 

Try this place!
