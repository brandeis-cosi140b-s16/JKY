Seriously delicious!

Hopped in the car this weekend with my mom and kid in tow and used the Yelp Ap on my android phone. It lead us to El Ranchero, which is typically not our Mexican go to in Wickenburg, but I am so glad we found this gem. The chips were good, so were the salsa and the bean dip. I ordered the Tricolor Enchilada combo and they were probably the best enchiladas I have had.  The chicken was so tasty, the shredded beef had good flavor, and the cheese enchilada was made using Mexican cheese (queso fresco I think) and it was sooo good.
 
The best part could of been that for 2 huge meals, 2 drinks, and an order of sopapillas it was under $25.

Cannot wait to take the husband there.
