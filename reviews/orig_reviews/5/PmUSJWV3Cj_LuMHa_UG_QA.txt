This is another place I have been eating at my whole life.  I've know of Rito's since I was a 4 years old. I'm 31 now. Everyone in my family is hooked on this place. I even got my wife and her family hooked.  I've have never had a better bean and cheese, red chile or green chile burrito! Their taco's are amazing as are their enchilada's.  I would challenge anyone to try a Rito's bean and cheese burrito and not get hooked. I was also fight anyone who says the food here is not the best ever.
