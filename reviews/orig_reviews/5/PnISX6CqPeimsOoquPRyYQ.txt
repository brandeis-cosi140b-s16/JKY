Born and raised in this place for the most part. I've been coming here for over twenty years. This restaurant is not traditional Mexican food but it makes no claims to be. The fajitas here are the best in Phoenix hands down. The seasoning on the meat and shrimp is perfect, the salsa and queso are both fantastic. The customer service is phenomenal.
