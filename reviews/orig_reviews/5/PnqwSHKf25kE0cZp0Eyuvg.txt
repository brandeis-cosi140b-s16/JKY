I really enjoyed my first dinner at The Mission, the service, atmosphere and menu were all exceptional. Going to Mission was a spur of the moment dinner idea, and we made reservations just an hour prior to dining. I would suggest reservations, we had to sit outside because they were full inside, and although they had a large and amazingly quiet fan outside, it was a bit hot. We sat by a fountain though, and that kind of made up for it, definitely will be back for more patio seating here when the weather cools down.

The waiter was very attentive, I think in part because we were one of the first tables seated on the patio. By the way, I am talking about the back patio, not the entrance area patio- I think the one in the back is better. 

Our app was the cheese plate, we chose the cheese similar to manchengo (I don't remember the name exactly, but the waiter related it). The cheese plate came with all kinds of goodies. 

I had the kale salad for dinner, and my boyfriend the pork tacos. We also got a side of street corn, our favorite. Everything tasted great. The kale salad had tons of marcona almonds, oranges and a light dressing, the portion was large. I had a bite of the tacos and they were great, but they are small and 3 to a plate, so for bigger appetites consider getting extra tacos. 

Dinner here was great, we will be back soon.  (:
