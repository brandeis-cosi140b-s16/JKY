We've been eating at Komex for 3 years...first the old location and now this one.  We absolutely love the owners and the food!  Their Korean meat and kimchi are some of the best in the city.  This is the closet to my mom's home cooking (real Korean food...not Americanized sauces and marinades).  They know us by name and have seen me pregnant with cravings to watching our kids grow.  It's a family place and couldn't feel more like home. 

The only downside for me personally is I wish they had a full Korean menu to satisfy all my cravings!  I just know they'd be amazing!
