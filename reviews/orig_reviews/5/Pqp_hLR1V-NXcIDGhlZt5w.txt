I really feel the poor reviews are unwarranted at Chayo. My guess is that they were because it is a new restaurant and they had some kinks to work out. I was there this weekend and had a fabulous time. Our hostesses greeted us warmly, our server was friendly, and the food was fantastic! The Yucca fries are a must get! I had the chicken enchiladas and was pleasantly surprised at the kick they had as I can't find spicy Mexican food anywhere in Vegas. My husband had the pork torta and loved it. And don't deprive yourself of the guacamole! Get a seat on the patio or the bar for some great people watching. We loved it and will be back (and it takes a lot to get this local to go to the Strip!)
