We tried this restaurant because we purchased a 1/2 off coupon online and because two friends continued to rave on and on about it. It's quite a distance from where we live and tend to go, but the food was so fresh and nicely prepared, we'll be back on a regular basis.  We can't say enough about the food or the service, both were excellent! It's nice to find a restaurant of this quality and the pricing is so reasonable!
