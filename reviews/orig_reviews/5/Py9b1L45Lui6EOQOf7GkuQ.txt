We decided on our last night in Vegas to try something new where we've never been. Well we have a huge love for mexican food and I found this restaurant on Yelp.com. I read a couple of the reviews and we were sold, it just sounded so good. 

We show up and we were greated not only by a bar with a ton of Tequila (hence it's a tequila bar also), but also by very nice hostess' who were so cute in very cute matching dresses. 

We were sat in a good seat with a great view of the bar and also the kitchen. We were automatically served some water, and greated by our waitress. 

To start we ordered the Guacamole with our chips and salsa, and I ordered a Strawberry Sangria. The Guac was TO DIE FOR, and even though I'm not a fan of wine the Sangria was AMAZING. The salsa that the chips came with was fantastic. We were also greated by this lovely woman who sells they're tequila she offers sample shots and can give you any tequila to fit your taste buds.

I ordered the Carne Asada Burrito Grande (meat, cheese, sour cream inside, though it came with much more I'm plain) but either way it was delicious! The steak was perfect and so tasty!

My friend ordered the chicken flautas and she looooooved them. Both come with their rice and beans, which were also great and I think it's a lime type rice. 

We loved it so much we didn't want to stop eating but we were so full. Everything was priced perfectly and not too expensive. Definitely making another trip there EVERYTIME I'm in vegas. 


Go and enjoy great mexican food!
