We ate here on a whim after dropping a friend off nearby. Holy Cripes! It was very good. Tastes like the homemade food your mexican friend's mom makes. I tried the fish taco combo ($5.99) and couldn't finish the entire plate. My girlfriend had the green chile beef burrito and enjoyed it. Said it reminded her of her mom's cooking (hence the reference to the mexican friend's mom's cooking). Blink and you'll drive past it. Awesome!
