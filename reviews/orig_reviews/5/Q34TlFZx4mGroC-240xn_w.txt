I have a new favorite Mexican joint! My usual affordable neighborhood place is closed for the summer, we had guests in from the east coast who wanted Mexican , I used yelp to find this place and I literally want to eat there again and I'm still full from the gigantic portion I just ate! I was happy with the staff ( take out) and the food. We arrived early to pick up our order and I noticed that when a party walks in the staff goes immediately to get their chips while the hostess is seating them, now that's service. I have 0 complaints about the food nothing we had was iffy or eh and our guests were impressed
