I love Crescent - it's one of my resident third places.  They get great headliners and put on a wonderful two-day music festival for Dias de la Crescent in the summer (I sincerely hope this becomes a standing music festival in the Valley.)  I went to the Halloween Ball and New Year's Eve party where there was free cover and some terrific DJs.  The staff is terrific - the bouncers do a great job with crowd control and you can always get a bartenders attention.  Bathrooms are always clean and the lines usually move pretty quickly.  Drinks are reasonably priced ($4 g&ts) and they make some wonderful house creations such as the "Honeybadger."  Also, it attracts a great blend of people. You can wear just about anything and fit in. 

I have so many fond memories of this place and will continue to frequent it.  Crescent Ballroom is one of the coolest venues in Phoenix!
