I was passing by this place on my way home today. And I was hungry so I took my phone out and checked out yelp to see what people were saying. I would have to say jackpot. Because it was great. The food , service and the prices wasn't bad.  
I like that you can buy different taco in stead of some kinda comb plate. So I got three different ones and the street corn which was great.. For me the shrimp one was not that spicy like the different review said. And I really do not like to give 5 stars but this place made my day!!!!
