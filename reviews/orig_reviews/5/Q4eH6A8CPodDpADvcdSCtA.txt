I've driven past Los Dos Molinos many times and always wanted to go in.  Finally finding the opportunity to try the food, my daughter and I ventured in and found a table.  We were well attended during our visit.  Two salsas arrived at our table -- green and red.  The red is the hotter of the two, and both have substance.  I ordered the green chili enchiladas because green chili is spicier than red chili, and who doesn't like enchiladas.  It came with an egg sunny side up.  I would add an egg to the top of most my meals if I could, so it is nice that I didn't need to place a special request.  My daughter had her usual cheese and bean burrito.  At Los Dos Molinos, it is called a burro.  We both enjoyed our meals.  The restaurant layout invite patrons to return during the warm, but not hot months of the year.  The doors were left open and there is a patio out back for dining and the consumption of alcohol.
