Last year Nacho Daddy accommodated a 20 person Christmas Party we had for our company. We ordered the nacho appetizers which were big platters, and we had one of each type of platter to feed a hungry crew of guys. The prices were reasonable and the atmosphere was great. We actually tried the scorpion shots and they got the party to a different level which was awesome! We thoroughly enjoyed our time there and will gladly recommend Nacho Daddy for lunch, dinner or parties. They deserve all 5 stars
