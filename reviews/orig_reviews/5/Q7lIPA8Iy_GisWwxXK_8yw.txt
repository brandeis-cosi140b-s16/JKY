My new MUST stop when I go to Vegas (It used to be Earl of Sandwich and Fat Tuesdays). I am one of those people who like to try weird stuff so as soon as I saw the menu I got excited. I got: Tripa, Sesos, Lengua, Cabeza, Adobada, and Carne Asada. I loved all of them specially the Adobada and the Sesos!! I also like the fact that they give you grilled green onions with you food! Amazing and made to order.
