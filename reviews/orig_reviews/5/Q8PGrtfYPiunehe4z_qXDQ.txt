Taco's done right. 

Had to try this place after eating at the original Tacos El Gordo in San Diego, CA.  The quality of the tacos is magnificent and the service is quick and friendly.

The best of the best of the menu is the "spicy pork" taco.  The spicy pork is topped off with flavorful onions, cilantro, and the greatest spicy avocado sauce you can dream of.   The best taco's here in town can be found right here at this unassuming joint on Craig.

Craig is littered with various Mexican restaurants but you'll miss out if you don't make Tacos El Gordo your primary stop.
