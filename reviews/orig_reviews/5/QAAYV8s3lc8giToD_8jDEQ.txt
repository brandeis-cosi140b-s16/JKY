This is a straight up taco joint smack in the middle of the craziness that is Las Vegas. The set up is a bit confusing so I left my boyfriend to order and I didn't experience the order/pay portion.

The tacos were so good! It was definitely busy and speaks to how good these are. I loved the pastor and he had lengua and also enjoyed them. It's a bit off the strip but worth stopping in to cure that hangover with some greasy goodness.
