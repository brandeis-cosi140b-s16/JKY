This place is awesome. ALWAYS ask for Tom. He honestly was one of the best servers I've ever had in Vegas. He can almost feel your personality. He understands everything you want whether it be good wise or alcohol wise. He constantly was checking on our table and making sure we had everything we needed. Going forward I will ask for him every time. Border Grille Gould recognize this employee. Without him I wouldn't be writing this review
