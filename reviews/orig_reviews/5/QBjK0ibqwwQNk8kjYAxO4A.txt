My husband had margaritas appetizers in the bar area, the bar tenders are great, the patron margarita is perfecto! Happy hour is great and cheap. The atmosphere is perfect, nice Spanish music, staff is friendly and professional and the bar tenders try to socialize, felt like a great local place. We didn't have any entree's but we will be back for dinner soon.
