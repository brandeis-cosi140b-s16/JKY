Those who didn't give Tacos Atoyac the five star rating that it so rightly deserves obviously didn't try the tacos de tripas. Yes, they're small. Yes, the price has gone up a full 25 percent to $1.25 per taco. But these little tacos are fantastically delicious enough for me to learn how to speak Spanish. SÃ­, ellos son tan buenos!
