Quite possibly my favorite restaurant in Charlotte. Obviously, I'm not impressed by expensive menu type places. Give me substance. That's what Maverick does. I really only ever get street tacos because they have more than a dozen types to choose from from your normal chicken to the exotic. 
If you don't get the street corn as a side, you're doing yourself a disservice. I actually called and got two orders of street corn for take out by itself one night.  Disclaimer: don't get it if you're on a first date. You WILL get the sauce all over your face.  

Great little bar area which has roll up doors for spring/fall fresh air.  Plenty of TVs for games. Nice little outdoor patio too.
