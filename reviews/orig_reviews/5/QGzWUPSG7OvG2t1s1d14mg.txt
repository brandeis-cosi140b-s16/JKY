Still loving their happy hours!!! The crab cakes are to die for, little spicy sauce gives them a kick. And wash them off with one or a few house margaritas!!! 

I also tried a few of their tequilas, they were iced cold, very nice. No more HH on weekends so remember good deal are M - F before 7:00pm.
