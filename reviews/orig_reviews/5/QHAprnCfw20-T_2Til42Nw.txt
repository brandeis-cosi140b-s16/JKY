We love this place! They have a nice happy hours which was better before the prices increased. Love their food, we have been here many times and always leave happy. My BF always gets the fundido(which is deliciously covered in cheese) and I switch it up. The margaritas and beer on tap are a must. The waiters are always super accomidating, wish they would bring back the buy 1 get 1 free :(
