Good price. Very quaint. Beautiful inside. Good chips and salsa. Good portions. Not a big fan of the burritos though. I have been here multiple times since my first review and I get their chimichangas. They are amazing. Usually I get ground beef which seems to be the most tasty option. Make sure to get beans and rice on the side.
