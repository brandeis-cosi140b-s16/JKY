I used to work right around the corner from here, and all of us "office girls" would go to lunch every month to "Los Dos."
The machaca is excellent!  I love my food a bit spicy.  Hey, if it doesn't make you cry while you eat it, what's the point?
Service is super-friendly and so are the other customers.  
The place used to be a morgue or something.  I love the outdoor area to sit while waiting.
