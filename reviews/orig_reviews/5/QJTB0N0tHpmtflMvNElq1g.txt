I recently stumbled on this place and love it. If you like Octopus, you will be happy to know the meat is cooked perfectly (not rubbery at all). I have tried the street tacos and gourmet. The gourmet veggie taco is the absolute best. Even if you are a 'meat' person, you will be surprised at how delicious and filling these are. I see a lot of negative reviews on the price and I am wondering where these people eat. You can get two large gourmet tacos, rice, and beans for like $10. It's inexpensive for the quality, freshness, and amount of food you get.
