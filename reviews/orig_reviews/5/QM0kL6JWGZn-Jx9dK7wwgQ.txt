This place is soooo good. Some of the food falls into the prestigious category of cuisine that makes it's eaters stop talking. Not because their marriage has become stale, but because the food is too fantastic to stop shoveling it in. 
I also love that they feature art from local artists and that some of it is for sale.
I didn't absolutely love the paella... It needed more flavor but I absolutely loved everything else.
