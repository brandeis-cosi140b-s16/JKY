Located a few miles off the strip, but toOOOOOootally worth it.

The concept here should be nothing new to anyone that doesn't live under a rock: Mexican-Korean fusion food... Think Kogi Truck, but in my opinion it's better: You don't have to track Komex down via twitter/fb, and there's no 1 hour+ outdoor wait for a food truck parked in a random lot. Best of all, there's a place to sit & enjoy the fantastic food right away, as it is being served to you by the friendly owners.

We ordered: 
- WonTons: Free via Yelp check-in, and they were yummy yeah, aw yeaaaah.
- 2 pan fried bulgogi (Korean beef) tacos - The special of the week. If you ever get this one, make sure you devour it while the taco shell is still hot & crunchy.
- Fusion chicken tacos: Fabulous chunks of grilled juicy chicken meat
- Fusion spicy pork burrito: The gf & I split this. Don't be intimidated by "spicy" pork - as with most Korean-style spicy pork, it's only mildly spicy if anything. For those that aren't too fond of kimchi, you can ask them to leave it out. But really, this burrito was originally designed to be eaten with the fresh kimchi cabbage to enhance the overall fusion experience.
- Bulgogi Fries: Think carne asada fries but with the bulgogi (slightly sweet marinated Korean beef) instead. This thing was massive.. since the 4 of us had wontons, chips, and like 3 tacos and half a burrito each, we weren't even able to finish these delicious fries.

- Free Chips & Guacamole/Salsa - The freshly fried homemade chips  were so awesome that we had to ask for more. I also couldn't believe that these free chips also came with guacamole. There was the traditional Mexican salsa, traditional Korean red pepper paste (a kinda sweet gochujang), and the group's favorite salsa which was sriracha (red rooster sauce) based mixed with some chili oil. We loved this sauce in particular so much that we asked for another cup of it.

The setting here closely resembles any other typical taqueria (their logo is a big cartoon dude wearing a huge sombrero) but offers much, MUCH more.

Thanks broham for finding another place to visit every single time we come to Vegas!

Cliff Notes: BOMB fusion burritos/tacos/fries/nachos with Korean-style meats & ingredients.
