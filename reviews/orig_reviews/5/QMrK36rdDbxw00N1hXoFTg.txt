The ROK is simply, sexy. If you really want to make an impression head downstairs. It's like a speak-easy atmosphere with friendly bartenders. I went 2... make that 3 nights in a row. Yes, it's that scrumpthicous (I know its not spelled that way, but when your tongue is sticking out from drooling, thats exactly how its pronounced). Nice!  The menu is tip-top. Go with the small plates, they're fun and deee-lish. The music is played by an ibook/ itunes and I even heard Pete Rock & CL Smooth. That brought me back to ....92? Rad! Take Chris C's advice. You can totally make out with someone here. Flawless.
