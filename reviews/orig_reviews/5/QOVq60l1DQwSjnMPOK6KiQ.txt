Korean Mexican Fusion...

Started in LA, expanding across the country. Very well done at KoMex with excellent service. great prices, and the proper divey feel. 

The pork belly, bulgogi, and spicy pork are great, no matter how you have it served. Be sure to have them add kimchi to whatever you order. The meat plates are generously portioned as are the nachos and tacos.

I wish there was one closer to me in San Diego...
