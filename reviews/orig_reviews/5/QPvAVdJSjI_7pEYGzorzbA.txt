We have been a fan of the Michoacan brand of  restaurants for years.  We have visited all of them at one point or another and many times for a special occasions like birthday's.  I cannot count how many time I have been called ponchito. Everything is fresh and delicious.  I always go for a combination plate because I can never decide on just one thing so I decided to eat three.  The fresh guacamole made table side is a must have.  

The service is always top notch. Everyone is very attentive to the guests needs weather it be a refill of water or chips and salsa.  If you cannot decide on what to get ask a server and they will make a recommendation you will not be disappointed with.  

These guys are locally owned and operated so be sure to go out and support them.

Sunday they do a brunch with 30 plus items that always look delicious.  I will have to try that one day soon.

Sometimes during the week they have a man playing a piano and singing which can add a nice vibe to your delicious meal.
