Casual dining, reasonable prices, friendly service, and great food!  If you don't fill up on the homemade salsa, guacamole and tortilla chips, try the Crusted Cod in a bowl with creamy beans and coconut rice!  As we say in Hawaii "broke da mouth!"  My friends also enjoyed the green chile chicken burrito and skirt steak tacos. Check it out!
