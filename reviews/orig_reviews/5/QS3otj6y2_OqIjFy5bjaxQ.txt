Oh my Hidden away friend Dick's... You have halted my visitations to Richardson's and kept my mouth and gullet happy with your outstanding foodstuffs and tasty maragritas.

It's hard to explain the menu. A marriage of southern mexican, seafood, pizzas and quality.

The place is small, nay, cozy. with great music always playing.

and if you need a private party, the back room is a great bet.

I'd like to say I wish Dick's would stay hidden, because it is a gem, but it's too great not to share.
