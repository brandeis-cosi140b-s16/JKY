What an amazing Mexican restaurant! Manny our server was great and friendly fron the begging! Jaime the Busser was on too of our table the entire time making sure we had enough to drink and kept clean. My girlfriend ordered carnitas mexicana that had jalapeños in. She ordered with light jalapeños but it was still extremely spicy for her. Hit or miss on spicy level. The manager Oscar came by immediately and fixed it right away. New plate not spicy and it came out super fast!  With such an amazing view, best margaritas in town and top notch food, this is a must for families or a romantic date!!
