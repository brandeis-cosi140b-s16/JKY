This place has something for everyone, while not a sit down restaurant , the food is super delicious and authentic. Coming from out of state it took us a while to find our kinda Mexican food, this place has it from shredded beef and street tacos to shrimp burritos and the red sauce for the enchiladas they do it all perfectly. Try the Mixteca  omlette for breakfast only if your really hungry and live music , full waitress service and relaxing ambience and cold beer on the patio perfect to relax after long week on fri- Sunday nights.
