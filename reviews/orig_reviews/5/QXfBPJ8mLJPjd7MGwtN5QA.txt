Simply the best tacos you will find in Phoenix. I have tried most of the menu, the fish tacos are amazing, the quesadillas are excellent, and the oaxacan hotdog is simply superb. The only thing wrong with this place is that they ever close. The salsas have great flavor but could definitely use some more heat, but the guac sauce just pushes everything to another level.

The area can seem a little sketch from the outside but you will not regret going inside.
