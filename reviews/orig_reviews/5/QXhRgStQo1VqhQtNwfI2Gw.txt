Second visit in 3 days because the food is really that good. Try some of the salsas at your own risk - so of them are way spicer than they look.

The best thing I've had so far is the arepas. Very delicious but depending on how saucy you are, you may want to ask for an extra side of the arepas sauce or grab some from the salsa bar squeeze bottle.

Can also get fried plantains (not on the menu) as a side which are delicious.
