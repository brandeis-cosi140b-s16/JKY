Went for dinner tonight and was very impressed. This place may not be fancy but it serves up some of the best green chile i have ever eaten. I have tried chile all over the southwest and this ones right up there. Fast friendly service and great chips and salsa. I hope more people find this place because it deserves to be a valley staple.
