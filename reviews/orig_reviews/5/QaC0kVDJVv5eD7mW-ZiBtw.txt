The atmosphere:
5 stars.We had a party of 7 plus a child and made reservations for 630. Reservations highly recommended as this place is rightfully busy! The service was amazing from the hostesses seating us immediately, to the very understanding, accommodating and efficient server,  even the manager, Doug, was friendly and entertaining. 
The Food:
5 stars. We have a very pocky, highly needy (allergies, likes and dislikes) group of friends. This place was spot on! Extremely accommodating, fast, delicious, hot and fresh. Gluten allergies, dairy allergies, vegetarians, you name we have it. The menu offers a very large array of choices. Food was seasoned succulently, prepared quickly and correctly. It was purely amazing! Pancho's is an instant favorite for sure.
