Nacho daddy was fantastic. I was there 2 years ago but from what the waitress told us it has drastically changed for the better since last visiting. I am so glad I gave it another shot! Everything my 3 friends and I ate was delicious. I got the white peach margarita the nachos and the carne Asada steak tacos which were absolutely delicious!!! The garlic fries which my friend had were amazing and for garlic lovers!!! We also got a dessert which was a nacho type smore and it was delectable!!! Our waitress recommended the perfect appetizer and desert for us! Even the left overs tasted great!
