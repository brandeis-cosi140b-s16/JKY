simply the best tacos in Las Vegas. Their Asada is second to none. Their Pastor while good is probably only topped by the Taco Truck on Bonanza and the boulevard. I've had tacos all over this city but this is quite possibly the only place I'll go from now on. I hear their exotic meats are good too but I'm not a fan of the types. I can only say of they're made with the same expertise as the other meats then they're just as delicious. 

if youre on east Charleston craving a quick bite there's no other place that's better.
