Hip place in a cool part of town. Parking is a pain, so you should probably plan to circle a few times, but that allows you to get the lay of the land like pioneers so it's all good.

Food was great - definitely recommend the tableside guacamole, and it's tough to go wrong with any of the entrees. 

Don't plan on this place for a quick in and out. It'll probably be slam-jam-thank-you-ma'am packed. That's not a bad thing, though. Go with a group (or just a few), plan to get a few drinks, post up outside, and enjoy the evening.
