Ahhhmazeballs!
My favorite red and green chilli burritos in town. Fresh, spicy, flavorful, and their tortillas are soft and homemade.
I've bought 8 one day and shared them with my coworkers. Their taste buds were also in heaven.
There is a reason why this place has been in business for so long! 
Go there today!
