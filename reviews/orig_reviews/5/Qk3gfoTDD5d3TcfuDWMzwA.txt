If I want to get tacos or a burrito in Madison this is the place I go. The place is small and can have a wait sometimes but if you ask me that's how you know it's good. The burritos are more than enough food to satisfy most anyone and the tacos come in a ton of varieties. And of course why not wash everything down with a Mexican Coca-Cola! 

You might have to walk a block or so after you park but it is more than worth it.
