The Blind Pig opened a few months ago and is close to our neighborhood but I would drive a good distance for this food!!  The food is so fresh tasting.
My husband had the Ceviche and loved it!  I had the Crispy Corn Taquitos ...soooo good!!!  The portions are very generous and prices very reasonable.
I can't wait to try everything on the menu.
Oh...and the outdoor patio is very nice and relaxing. Servers are very friendly and helpful.
