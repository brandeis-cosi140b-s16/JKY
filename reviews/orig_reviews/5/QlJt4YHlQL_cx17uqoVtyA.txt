This review is based on experience at the bar. Unfortunately we didn't have time to eat more than just chips and salsa, which by the way may have been the best chips and salsa I've ever eaten. A group of 6 of us wandered in looking for a quick drink. Everyone at the bar was very nice and the drinks came fast. Oh, and there's a swing! Like right at the bar! So fun and creative, but not in the cheesy seedy way that many of the Vegas bars are. You will not find flashy foot long glasses and servers in bikinis here!! We were so impressed with the service and the style of the place that my husband and I stopped in again 2 nights later, and to my surprise the whole staff remembered and welcomed us back like family! The margaritas were Delicious. One of the friendliest places we visited in Vegas. A trip to La Comida will most definitely be on our agenda on our next Vegas vacation.
