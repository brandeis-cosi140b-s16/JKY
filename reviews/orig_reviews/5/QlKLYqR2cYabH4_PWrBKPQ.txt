Aunt Chilada's has been home for me since I can remember. Great food, good beer selection and great atmosphere are to be expected. Friday Night they always have live music. Highly recommend the Green chile burro and the fritangas are fantastic. If Jasmine is behind the bar ask her to make something special. She loves coming up with fun and tasty cocktails to suit your palate. Tucked away in the neighborhood by the Pointe Squaw peak it is a perfect oasis where everyday feels like you are on the beach in Rocky Point.
