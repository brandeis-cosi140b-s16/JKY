Those of you who have found SumoMaya a delight for dinner will find their brunch very much in the spirit of their later offerings. Peg and I ate brunch today for the first time and loved it!  I understand that there are venues who serve breakfast nearby, but the experience and the food is not the same by any stretch. I had the crispy pork belly Benedict with guac, soft poached egg, and hollandaise (with a hint of Valentina...a Mexican hot sauce) that was superb. Peg had the Quesadilla with wood grilled chicken, roasted corn, smoked bacon, and queso  chihuahua (no, not the dog).  Josuelo was our server and could not have been more accommodating. My new BFF (although she may not be aware of it...yet) is Chef Amy who is an incredible baker...and the basket of assorted pastries was in-house made and wonderful. Tai, as always is the gracious host and who I am convinced  lives on the property. Not a detail was overlooked!  I would strongly recommend that for an exceptional early (starts at 9:00 am) wake-up-the-taste-buds experience, that you check this place out for the first meal of the day in addition to the last!
