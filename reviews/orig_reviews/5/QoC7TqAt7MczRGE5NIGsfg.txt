I really loved this tiny little taco shop. The salsa was among the best and freshest I have ever had! I enjoyed their fish tacos and the price was a huge surprise. The tacos were full of fresh delicious ingredients and you could add additional items at the salsa bar. Come here hungry, BYOB and you will leave with change in your pocket. They have a briskly take out business too. I only wish they had a location in North Phoenix, I should buy a franchise....
