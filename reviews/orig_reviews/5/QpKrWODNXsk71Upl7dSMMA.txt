We have been here about ten times for breakfast usually after hiking and still have not tried anything but the mixed machaca and chilaquilas and the steak and eggs. The one exception was a few weeks ago and I also had a small bowl of amazing posole but was unable to finish my machaca. The food is quite simply fresh, fast and flavorful. Be warned it gets busy and no matter how early you get there it has a line but it moves fast.
