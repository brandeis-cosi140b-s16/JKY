Stopped in for lunch, and oh so glad I did. 
This is a very casual lunch, dinner spot. 
Service is excellent and food was just as good!
My husband and I shared the Carne Asada Fries, the corn on the cob, and tacos (carne asada, carnitas, and chicken)
All this food was delicious and under $20.....
I will definitely be back!!
