it's now my favorite cheap food place in las vegas! 
This is the perfect korean mexican fusion place. 
I always get the bulgogi bowl. It comes with rice, veggies, kimchi, lots of bulgogi and a special chili pepper sauce with mmm egg and sesame oil on top. The portions are huge so you can always have yummy left overs. 
The wonton soup is super yummy here too but that is the only thing they say they put MSG on. But it is still super delicious. 
The best part is they offer FREE chips with guac and salsa! They always have great service too! 
this place is about 5 miles off the strip but if you want affordable and large portions, go here!
