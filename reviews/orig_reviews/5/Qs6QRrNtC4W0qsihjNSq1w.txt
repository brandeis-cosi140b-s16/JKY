Was in Arizona for a day on business and had a few hours to kill during lunch. I Googled "must eat places in Phoenix" and this place was mentioned amongst others.  It sounded very casual which was what I was looking for. When you think fusion, you normally think foods that are a like. Chinese and Mexican are not two cuisines you think of. Well, it doesn't matter what I think cus they make it work here. From the customer service to the cookie dessert it's a great hole in the wall. Upon entering I didn't know the ordering process. It was a bit of a doozy since you can get your meat in a burrito or quesadilla and they have quite a few selection of meat to choose from. When the server asked if this was my first time, obviously yes since I had a confused look on my face, he asked me if I liked spicy foods and asked if I wanted a sample. I am a human. I eat. I never say no to a sample. He gave me 6 samples. The very last one he however asked if I ate pork.  My first thought was who wouldn't eat such a delicious animal. Then as time passed I realized how considerate he was being. I am Asian and he thought to ask such a question. I thought that was extremely considerate. Anywho, he helped me pick out a great dish and filled my belly. Unfortunately, I never got his name so I can't singly give him praise. But, I know who you are so my belly thanks you for helping me pick out an awesome lunch bowl and being so considerate. 

P.S. - I'd give it an extra star for their mascot, Pancho Panda. What a magnificent beast.
