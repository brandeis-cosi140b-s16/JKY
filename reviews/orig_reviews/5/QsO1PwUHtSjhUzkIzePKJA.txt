Recommended by a local we had to check this place out.

Words can not even begin to describe how truly amazingly delicious the food is. The flavors are truly original, unlike anything I have ever tasted. 

We dinned on the following:
Chorizo Stuffed Chicken
Cruz Kitchen
  
I'm so impressed with this place I wold plan a vacation around dining here!
