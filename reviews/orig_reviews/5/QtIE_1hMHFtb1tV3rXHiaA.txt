The food in this place is absolutely delicious! I mean it is soooo perfect but I was so dissapointed I was driving eating my burrito and there was a pretty long black hair in it. It was disgusting and I'm scared to go there again. I wonder if they wear hair nets? I mean the food is amazing and I hope they take more precautions when dealing with food.
