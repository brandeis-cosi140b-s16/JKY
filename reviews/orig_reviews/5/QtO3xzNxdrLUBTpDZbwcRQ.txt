My friends brought me here with the promise of the best tacos ever! I will say they did not disappoint! We had a big dinner planned and this served only as a snack so I only ordered three adobada tacos. It was like a huge tease, I wanted more! I actually stole one of my guy's to eat. He wasn't happy =P. 

The next day, we went back and ordered 28 between three people. It was delicious and I can't wait to go back. 

Try the adobada with pineapple!
