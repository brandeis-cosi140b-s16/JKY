I am absolutely amazed there aren't more reviews and praises for this gem of a place.

I've lived in Phoenix *forever* (cue Sandlot kid imitation) but I had never heard of Nando's.  It took one generous roommate and three short phone calls to direct him and I to... (soft nostalgic music)... Nando's.  

This place will never be featured in the food section, and never on anything artsy or "modern", but the taste and flavor of their normal, and fantastic fare will forever be etched in my mind.  But on to the specifics:

My roommie's a vegetarian (sigh) and ordered their spinach enchiladas with this amazing creamy cheese sauce on top.  He, I kid you not, licked up every single last drop of the cream sauce.  I ate my pride (along with everything else) and tried his enchiladas.  They are freaking amazing, but not as much as my food.

I ordered the mesquite grilled chicken tacos, on corn tortillas, and it came with a huge portion of grilled veggies, rice, guacamole and pico de gallo.  The pico de gallo was gone in a second... I treated it like a palate cleanser between the main meal and the chips we had (did I mention they have fantastic chips and salsa?).  The rice and guacamole were....well... hate to be a downer, but they were only so so.  The tacos and grilled veggies, however, were perfect.  Whoever was manning that grill knows his (or her) job very very well.

As an aside, I also had an amazing breakfast the next day of tacos, rice and salsa.
