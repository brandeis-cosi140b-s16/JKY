In Phoenix for a few days with my husband and was wanting some Mexican cuisine. I did a quick search here on yelp for something highly rated. This was at the very top of the page. We tried it out and loves it. As it was our first time, and there was only one other couple in line - who were also there for the first time - we received samples of the differently spiced meats they have! It was a bit like a taco cart/street vendor but much better!!! They have a variety of meats, chicken, pork and lamb...quite a few were very spicy but delicious! The place was really well decorated...soo cool...in a Mexican wrestler style (think Nacho Libre). I tried the jalape√±o cream cheese - I wasn't crazy about it but the tacos and meat are where it's at. Very affordable. Delicious Horchata and guacamole. The service was really very good!!!!! Will be back if ever in the area again.
