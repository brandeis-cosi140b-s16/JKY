I can't understand why this restaurant doesn't have more GREAT reviews; I'm thinking some people just do not get it. It is a treasure and something not to be missed when in Las Vegas, it is perfect for lunch. we loved the 20 Vegetable fried rice and the chilaquiles were our favorite. If you're looking for a bargain, China Poblano is not your place but if you appreciate delicious and innovative food, you will love it!
