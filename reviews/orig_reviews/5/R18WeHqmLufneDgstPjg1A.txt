I love this place, friendly staff, food is great, loved the mushroom enchilada, steak salad is always a solid choice and of course the classic jerk chicken salad, appetizers are awesome.  ZTejas has my favorite salsa of any restaurant, wish they would bottle it.  Drinks are awesome.  Fun, upbeat vibe, great location.
