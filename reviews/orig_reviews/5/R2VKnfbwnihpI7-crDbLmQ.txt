Best Mexican Fast Food in town! Love the Oaxaca burrito, tortillas to go (great with butter!). Other recommendations are the chicken burrito (very juicy!), and the machaca plate. It's all good! Service is fast, so don't worry if there's a line when you walk in. It's normal. I usually order to go...avoid the restrooms at all cost. If you must go, expect the same experience as a "Honey Bucket" (very gross!). If you want to dine in, go to the Shea location. The food is the same but bathrooms are much cleaner!
