Spicy Korean style wings were fabulous!  I actually wouldn't order wings if it was the last food on earth, but the lovely head lady suggested I try it.  I'm glad I took her advice because they were the most delicious wings I've ever had.  They took time and patience in marinating the meat; whereas, most restaurants buy frozen and don't do anything to them except drop them in a fryer and serve.  Bravo Komex!!!
