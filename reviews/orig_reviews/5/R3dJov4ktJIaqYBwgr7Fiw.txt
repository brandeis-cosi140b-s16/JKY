Awesome Margaritas!!! Good tequila selection. Menu is awesome! Their restaurant week menu was so great. 

I am gluten free and it is so refreshing to see a place label their normal menu with gf options!! Made my day!!! 

Also have had the fish tacos. Amazing! I wish Verde was closer to my house! Regardless I will be back! 

Gluten free people- the staff knows their stuff and I had no problems with the food.
