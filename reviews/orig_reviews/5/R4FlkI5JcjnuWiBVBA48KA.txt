We went here for the second time last night and it did not disappoint. Service is very good but not overbearing. Ordered the guac made at our table for an appetizer which was fantastic. Pomegranate seeds are a nice addition. Every dish was packed with flavor, but by far the waiter's recommendation of the Veracruz was the best. Moist fresh fish and the chipotle potatoes were stellar.  Wish I could go back again tonight.
