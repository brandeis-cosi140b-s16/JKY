This place is always packed no matter what time of days. My husband and I had to eat there again before we headed back home. We were both still amazed of its adobada's awesomeness. Every time we took a bite, we were just savoring its deliciousness. This place clearly serves the best tacos, especially the adobada. So, for you who is wondering if this place worth the wait in long lines? The answer is...heck YES! I wish I live nearby so I can it there often.
