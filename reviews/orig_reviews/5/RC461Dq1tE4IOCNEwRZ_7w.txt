This is a new fave place of mine.

The servers were nice, the food was great!

The tortilla chips come with three different salsas.  Yum!

I ordered the chicken and cheese enchiladas.   Very good.  Too much food for me to finish by myself but I tried.

It can be pretty loud in there due to the music out by the pool but if you sit near the back it isn't so bad.

I wish I had gotten a shirt.   Next time.
