Absolutely the best Mexican food I've ever had! The queso Is AMAZING - worthy of a meal in itself. We had batter-dipped fish tacos, carne asade tacos, and chicken penuches, and they were all phenomenal. Flavors are well-balanced, nothing over-seasoned, and very creative recipes. VERY GOOD FOOD!
Lovely decor, excellent wait staff (especially Jessica) and good drinks. 
Definitely a great choice for lunch, if you're anywhere near Mandalay Bay.
