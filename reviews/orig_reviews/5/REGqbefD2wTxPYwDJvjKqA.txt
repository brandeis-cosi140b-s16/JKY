This place is awesome. I have grown up in AZ and have been to Rocky Point more times than I can count. Going to Baja Joe's reminds me of "The fish market" stretch of places to eat in Mexico. It brings me back immediately to the good 'ol "REAL" Mexican food.

Go once and you will be hooked. It's closer than Mexico too  ;)
