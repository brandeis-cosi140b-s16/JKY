I can't say enough good, no make that GREAT things about Chayo.  It was exciting to explore the new landscape of The Linq, but stumbling upon this gem was the added bonus of the evening.  The decor was gorgeous and inviting, and the food was the outstanding... truly the most authetic Mexican meal I've had to date on the Las Vegas strip. The accomodating staff greeted my young daughters and I with a smile and quasadillas.  Chayo is not only chic, but top-notch all the way around.  Order the Paloma margarita...you can thank me later!
