Have you ever been really drunk off a small amount? Say... one drink? And you feel just absolutely horrible and want to die? Nahh.... me either.

BUT... just in case this DOES happen and you are at, say, The Clubhouse watching a show, you can scoot your bum over to Los Favoritos and have your life saved!

Yummmm does not begin to describe the food. 10x that of any ____bertos. I mean that. (Sorry Julio).

They even put french fries inside Dallas G's burrito. I have never seen him so happy. Ever.

Plus, when I said I was vegan and gf the chick said, well, get a bean taco! Do you know how long it usually takes to explain to someone that I just want a bean taco. No meat. No cheese. Just a bean taco. That's right. Just beans. So major kudos to her for grasping the concept that there are freaks like me in the world who don't eat animal products.

I used to eat their breakfast burritos as well. Their potatoes are fabulous.

Stop what you are doing and go now.
