Read the reviews and could not believe the praise and comments.  I had to check this place out.  It is in a strip mall and at first glance, I was not overally impressed.  Open the doors and was met with a huge menu and great detail for each item.  Placed the order and got my own chips and salsa.  Now the adventure begins,  chips and salsa was warm and fresh.  After a couple of minutes of covnersation, food arrived.  From the first bite to the last, flavor and presentation were outstanding.  You would not think the kitchen could produce such a excellent meal, but they did for the entire group.  Well done.
