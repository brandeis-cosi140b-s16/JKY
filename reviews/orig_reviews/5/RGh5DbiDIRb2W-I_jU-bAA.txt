We moved here a month ago and stumbled on this place. Since then it has become our #1 Mexican restaurant in Vegas and we have been there TWICE. The food is delicious and the chips not only come with salsa but also refried bean dip. The customer service is excellent; they will continuously check up on you and ensure all is well (to include drinks being topped off). It's a bit smaller so usually you'll have to wait a few minutes for a table/booth but I have never had to wait as long as they predict. The parking lot is a bit small too but both times we've simply parked next door and walked over. There has been live music both times but it has been acoustic etc so it isn't overwhelming. We went on Cinco de Mayo and it was great too. There were even Corona girls there passing out little Corona shawls for your beer bottles, and there were drink specials too. Love this place.
