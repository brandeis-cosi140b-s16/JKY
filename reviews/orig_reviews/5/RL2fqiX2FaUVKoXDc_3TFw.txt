One of the BEST places to eat! I moved here from Colorado 6 years ago and searched for awhile for a great Mexican food place to eat. I give this place 5 stars because it is that good and if your looking for a great place to eat this is it. We always get the #1 and 14. The salsas are the best. Our favorites are the green chili and the sour cream with chili. 
On The weekends you cannot get ahold of them by phone because they are busy. I just walk in and place my order. I have no issues doing that because I know the food is that good to do so.
