Fantastic burgers.  The pickled (?) onions add such a great layer of flavor.  The sweet potato tater tots were perfect.  The fries were amazing, we tried the "seasoned" version and they were so good.  The shake of the day was a Coco Puff malt so delicious! 

Friendly staff, clean and welcoming.  Packed to the brim so luckily it was nice enough to sit outside to eat!

We will be sure to go back again!
