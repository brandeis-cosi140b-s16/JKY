Visited Joyride on a Friday night for date night. Was immediately impressed by the decor and vibe. Seconds after being seated we were brought iced waters and chips with salsa. The chips and salsa were great, the salsa had just the right amount of spice and was very fresh. 

We were soon greeted by our server Justin, he was awesome. Made great drink recommendations including the pineapple mojito which I decided to go with, it was delicious! So refreshing! My fianc√© went with the horchata with captain morgan, another suggestion from Justin and he was not disappointed.

For our meal we decided to get an array of tacos. We literally loved every one we tried. Out favorites included the ahi tuna, crispy fish and shrimp. They really all were great tho. 

Lastly, we ended the meal with the churros. They come with a chocolate dipping sauce however our server recommended getting the caramel sauce as well, good thing we did, the caramel was delicious. 

Long story short we will definitely be back and hope to see Justin again! Joyride was definitely a two thumbs up from us!!
