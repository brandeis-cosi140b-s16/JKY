There is a very good reason why this nationally known, family run business is the top-rated restaurant in the area, GREAT, FRESH FOOD and TREMENDOUS SERVICE!  Nothing here is canned or stale.  I am a basic enchilada and chicken quesadilla guy, but Roberto's are AMAZING.  If you are feeding several mouths and want to get the best food for your money, this is the place to go.  They make their own Salsa, which you can buy by the bottle, and it is authentic like you get in Mexico, as opposed to the Americanized "sludge salsas".  My wife loves the carnitas and you will not find a better tasting taco.  Anthem is not known as having many great restaurants, but this one stands out. If you are not from the Anthem area, this place is definitely worth the drive:!
