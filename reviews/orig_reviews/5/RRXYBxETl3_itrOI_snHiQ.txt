Love this restaurant. It's my go to restaurant since La Palmas closed in 2005 (sell out). 

The reason I like it is it is almost the same food wise as La Palmas was. I love the cheese enchiladas, though I could do without the olives. Love the machaca tacos (always done right). Red chili burros are excellent. Cheese crisps are really good. Hot and fresh chips. Hot sauce is really good. 

The only bad thing about the restaurant is that they do not have a location close to me. So I can't go there as much as I would like.

Service has never been a problem at either of the 2 locations I have been to.

One note for this and other Mexican restaurants. Why are people charged more when you order something without rice and beans? Most of the time the amount of food minus the rice and beans is way more than enough. I can't tell you how many times I see plates with rice and beans left on them. They just get thrown away.
