The luchador theme is awesome. Amongst other things, reminds me of Nacho Libre! The burritos are humongous. I'd compare to a fresher, more homemade Chipotle, which I think is great. A few of the meats are on the saltier side but it isn't too bad. Service is also great, they are extremely friendly and helpful. Will definitely go back to try some other things.
