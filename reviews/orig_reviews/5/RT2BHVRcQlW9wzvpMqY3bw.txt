Loved this place! Went with a group of 19 and ordered many of the dishes off the menu. The Kimchi Fried Rice is a must, as well as the Wild Mushroom Tacos. On top of the delicious food, was the incredible ambience and beautiful decor, topped off nicely with a very friendly waitstaff. I will definitely be back!!
