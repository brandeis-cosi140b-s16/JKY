It was my first time coming here tonight. I went through the drive through and they asked if I would rather pull up to the window to sample the meat before I purchase. I tasted the steak, pork, and chicken. It was pretty good so I decided to go inside. I got a bbq steak burrito. It sounds weird but it blended well with the sour cream and salsa. The service was excellent and helpful. My burrito was awesome and I got really full before I even finished it which is usually not the case for me. I hope this place stays
