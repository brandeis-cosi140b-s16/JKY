I came here about a week ago. Saw the great following on yelp and decided it was worth a trip. The place isn't much to look at. 

When I came in I found a place at the bar and had a 2$ Margarita.  This pitcher was made strong, and the bar tender was very nice. He kept filling my glass and didn't charge me a dime for my drink. 

The food was yummy and there was a lot of it. 

I ordered the 97. Beef taco, chili rellino, and a cheese enchilada.  I asked them to add shredded chicken to my enchilada.  Worth it.  

Everything was yummy.  The service was very good. I felt very comfortable in this place. I would come back.
