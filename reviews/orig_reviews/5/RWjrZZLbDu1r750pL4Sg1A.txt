Establishments like this are the exact reason I am grateful for yelp.  We are currently crossing the country from Maine to Washington and have had to rely on either word of mouth, chain restaurants or (thankfully) yelp.  I can honestly say that we probably never would have found this gem if it had not been for yelp.

First of all, we ate at the counter in the front and watched all the magic in the kitchen.  It was warm upfront, but my husband cooled himself with a Negro Modelo, I enjoyed a mandarin soda and our daughter stuck with water.  Everyone was terrifically friendly.  It was a delight to watch all the cooking happening.  The food was incredible to boot.  I had a chicken chimichanga which came with rice, beans and lettuce, my husband had a burrito mexicano with a gordita on the side and our daughter had three chicken tacos.  Combine this with tortilla chips and some of the best salsa I have ever had and we were in heaven.  Just when we thought our meal couldn't get any better, one kindly gentleman who worked here gifted us with a green tamale, on the house.  It.  Was. AMAZING.  Fresh, perfect consistency and positively tasty.

And then there is the thing that drive this amazing establishment into overdrive:  The price.  The grand total for all of the delicious, tasty goodness above?  $26.  Seriously.  The three of us can hardly go out for breakfast at that price, let alone some of the best mexican food we have ever had.  

If you are in Madison run, don't walk, to Taqueria Guadalajara.  You will be delighted that you did.
