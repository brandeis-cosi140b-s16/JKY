This is my new favorite Mexican place when I'm traveling north from Phoenix. My favorite food is Mexican food. This place does not disappoint. For the price and quality you can't beat it. This place is super clean and the people are friendly. This place featured on food network so I had to try it. It looks like they have upgraded from a gas station restaurant. It's always a bonus when the owners are working at the restaurant and meeting the customers.
