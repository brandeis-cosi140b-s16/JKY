Hands down the best taco chain but too bad it's not anywhere near my hometown. No complaints here because now I have another reason to visit Las Vegas. The al pastor meat is not easy to find and these guys really got it down. Even the horchata tastes like the ones in Tijuana. I'm not saying the Horchata is the best but it sure does compliment their delicious food. My poison is the mulas with handmade corn tortillas. It's like Mexican version of a burger. Make sure you have plenty of napkins bevause they eat a little messy but the flavor can't be beat. I hope this chain comes to the L.A. area soon but in the meantime the Las Vegas trips are going to have a little pit stop.
