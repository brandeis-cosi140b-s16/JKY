Delicious food, nice cocktail variety & awesome venue!

We visited cb for happy hour & the Nick Waterhouse concert.  

*We were thrilled with the happy hour menu and we ordered nachos, tacos, & bean dip.

*Beer & wine on happy hour but sadly my margarita was not!  Oh well I still had 3. Loved the tall glass of tangy tequila paradise to pre party for our retro guitarist friend Nick.

*The fish tacos were delicious with great seasoning! Finally a restaurant that's not afraid to flavor something simple!

*The nachos were over the top with every topping item you may dream of.  Absolutely the pinnacle of Arizona nacho happiness.

Our server was a nice professional gal- I think Melissa?  Really appreciated her listening and timing to make our night fly by talking with friends.  Everyone from start to finish at crescent ballroom was professional & patient though not overly friendly.  I can appreciate straight to the point and don't always need an emotional connection with the bartender.

As a concert venue they have the standing area with bleacher style seating in the back.  We did a combo of standing / sitting/ walking around.  The bathroom was huge with no one in there!  Usually concert bathrooms are long waits- not at this posh hipster venue!  Finally they have a bar inside the venue so we were glad for the Arizona stronghold rose & cocktails.
