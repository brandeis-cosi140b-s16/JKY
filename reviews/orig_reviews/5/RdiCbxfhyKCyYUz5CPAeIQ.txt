Carolina's Mexican Food is both authentic and delicious!! Somewhat sketchy location, but if you carry out, the location doesn't make much of a difference. My favorites are the bean and cheese burrito and the green corn tamale (I'm a vegetarian, so I can't provide feedback on the meat, but I'm sure it's just as delicious). The tortilla's are handmade pieces of heaven, which you can purchase in bags for your own home-made delights. 

Today, I put my order in around 11:30, and the place was practically empty. But within five minutes, it completely filled up, so get there early if you don't want to wait! It took about 15 minutes for my food to come up (2 bean and cheese burritos and a tamale) which wasn't bad. The people watching is interesting enough to keep you entertained until your food is ready. If you're looking for some cheap, tasty Mexican food, and you're in the downtown area, I would definitely recommend Carolina's.
