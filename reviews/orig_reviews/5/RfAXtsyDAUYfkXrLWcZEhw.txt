Driving down the rough streets of north phoenix, I have never really taken the time to look at the many restaurants that adorn the streets. I thought north phoenix was really only pawn shops, tire shops, and smoke shops, but my gf had heard of this place so we made a special journey out to La Condesa. After checking to make sure our doors were locked 4 times, we entered this "gourmet" taco shop...and boom all my misconceptions were erased.

This place is extremely clean and friendly. The tacos I ordered were overflowing with flavor and ingredients. I was thoroughly filled after two tacos.  I had the Shrimp tacos - not the cabo ones, i think they were simply grilled and guess what? that's right, no diarrhea afterwards. Also had the the sonoran carne asada tacos....which were arrachera steak marinated with fresh garlic & olive oil, charbroiled with mesquite charcoal. The tacos were amazing and the salsa bar was mind blowing. The yhave about 12 salsas to try from and I had to try them all. My personal favorites were the cilantro, chipotle and the surprisingly  yummy peanut salsa.

I REALLY wanted the horchata, but they had just run out..i won't ding them for running out because we did come in 5 minutes before closing. Can't wait to go back here, you gotta give this place a try.
