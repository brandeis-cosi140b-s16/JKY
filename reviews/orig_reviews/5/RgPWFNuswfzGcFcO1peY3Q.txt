Go for the blood orange margaritas! That's reason enough.  The rest of the food that I have has was good. It is a quality taqueria. Not fine dining, but really tasty and fresh, and the service is very good.  

I feel like the chalkboard menu is a little hard to read, so it takes a minute, but that's a minor issue.
