The food was amazing.  We had the Lucky 8 Sui Mai, Langosta and Carnitas taco's. It was the best carnitas taco that I have ever had. The tortilla was lighter than I expected for homemade. The guacamole was made just like I like it. Everything was full of flavor. Just perfect. I can't wait to go back.
