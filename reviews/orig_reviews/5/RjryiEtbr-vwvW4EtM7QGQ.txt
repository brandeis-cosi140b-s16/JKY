I have been wanting to Yelp about this place for a long time! This small Mexican fast food restaurant gives you the quality of a gourmet Mexican restaurant for the price of fast food. Their daily specials are always very very good. When not getting the daily special (my favorite is the Chile Relleno's), I usually get the Pork Salad with extra meat. The staff are all required to yell out EXTRA MEAT or EXTRA CHEESE when a customer orders them. Lol. Btw their burrito's are huge!
