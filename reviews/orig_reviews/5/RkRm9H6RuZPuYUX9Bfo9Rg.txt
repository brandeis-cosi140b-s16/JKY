We ended up here late at night after partying from a tip we got from our cabdriver from the night before.  I'm not sure how he ended up telling us about this place, but I am SO happy he did. 

It's not far from the main part of the strip, just a few minutes past the Wynn in this janky strip mall area, but you can't miss it since there is a big sign at the front of the building.  

You walk in and order right from the guy making your taco/burrito/nachos/fries/meat, and you can watch them making everything fresh.  I was especially excited that they were pressing and cooking their own tortillas on the grill right in front of me.  The way they cook their meat reminded me of a churrascaria, including the pineapple heads on the ends.  You could see the juice dripping allllll the way down the meat as it cooked on the spit...oh man. *drool*

We had just 1 carne asada fries to share between 3 girls and 1 carne asada taco to try.  This was more than enough food for us for our late night cravings.

Forget the crap fast food places on the strip after drinking.  If you want legit Mexican food late at night after partying hard in Vegas, do yourself a favor and grab a cab and tell them to get you to this tacqueria.
