I can't believe I have never reviewed this place, because I go there all the time. It's the best option when you are in the mood for fresh, gourmet mexican food in a hip environment. The mexican-style corn on the cob is delicious, as are the tacos and quesadillas. I would suggest getting some horchata as well. It is nestled inside the Clarendon Hotel, a cool boutique hotel with awesome decor and lots of history (check out the wall by the bathrooms which explains the story of a carbomber who tried to bomb the hotel in the 70's). A great place for any occasion - first date, casual night out or a big group.
