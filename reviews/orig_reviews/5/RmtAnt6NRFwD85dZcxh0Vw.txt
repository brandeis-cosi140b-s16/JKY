Stopped here on our way back to California and had a wonderful experience. My fiance ordered the carne asada which was seasoned and cooked perfectly. I ordered the chicken chimichanga which tagged better than any other I've ever had at a Mexican restaurant. Definitely a must to try!! The staff was great and personable. We will be back!
