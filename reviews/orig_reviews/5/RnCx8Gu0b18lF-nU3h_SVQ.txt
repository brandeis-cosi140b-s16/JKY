SOOOOOO ooo OOOO ooo GOOD!! We came here on Sunday for Brunch and it was the best decision ever.  The bloody mary was delicious and spicy with red chili/peper flakes in it.  The eggs benedict my husband got had a jalepeno holindase sauce to die for and the huavos rancheros.... words cannot describe. I don't think I will ever be able to order this dish again.  The house made chile sauce (do the mix of red and green) was seriously amazing.

Lots of choices in Phoenix but this is definitely a must!
