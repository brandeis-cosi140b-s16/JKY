Please don't let their dive-y appearance and deserted-motel surroundings deter you from eating here! This place is a gem.

Not only are the staff friendly, quick and on top of their game, but the food is FANTASTIC!! On Sundays I always order their vegetable fajita special: for only a few dollars you get a giant, sizzling plate of vegetables, rice and refried beans, and all the fajita fixings your heart desires. They also have endless chips and (what might be the best) salsa (in the world). Try their queso too, it's quite good.

Now that I live in Ballantyne, I rarely am able to trek to Miguel's but I dearly miss their food, great service and unbeatable prices.
