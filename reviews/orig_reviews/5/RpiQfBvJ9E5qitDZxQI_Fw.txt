Everything about this place was excellent. Prices were great, the food was fantastic, portion sizes were huge....and did I say that the food was fantastic?

The salsa was made over smoked pecans, and it was, hands down, some of the best salsa I've ever tasted. I ordered a few different items from the menu, including a "Christmas" (red and green salsa) enchilada, some carne adovada, and a chicken taco. The meal came with rice and beans (cooked to perfection) and all this for $15.

Our server was fantastic - attentive, and very helpful when suggesting menu items. The atmosphere was welcoming and comfortable.

All in all, this place was a great experience, and my team and I were all very thankful we came.

5 stars.
