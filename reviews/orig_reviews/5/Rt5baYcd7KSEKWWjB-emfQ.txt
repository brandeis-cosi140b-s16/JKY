Um yea... this is almost a little too over the top. The decor/style is the finest of any Mexican restaurant I have ever seen. The food is so far from your typical Mexican fare that it is actually hard to describe. This is great for people who love Mexican food and can handle a little heat. Get the Jalape√±o shooters to get started!!!
