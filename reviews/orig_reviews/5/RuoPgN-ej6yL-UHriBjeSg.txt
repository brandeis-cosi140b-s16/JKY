I've been here just a few times during restaurant hours so this review is based off the restaurant experience opposed to a bar-related review.

The food here is unique and for the most part phenomenal. You will find "blends" here that you may have never thought of but they are delicious and at a great price. I stopped by for my first "Taco Tuesday" here and enjoyed my meal. You can't get unique tacos for the combination of price and quality elsewhere in the area (this is coming from someone who's lived 10 min from Mexico). Additionally, the staff seems great and real friendly. Parking isn't the easiest but there are plenty of options.
