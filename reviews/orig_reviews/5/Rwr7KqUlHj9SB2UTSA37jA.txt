Ever since I checked out the brunch menu online a few weeks ago I have been dying to make it down to Border Grill, and it did not disappoint! We made reservation through Open Table and were seated as soon as they opened. Our server Autumn was great, and I never got to the bottom of one mimosa before another one was at the table. The mimosas are some of the best I've ever had and come in a variety of flavors (passion fruit, grape fruit, peach, etc). My husband had the cafe de olla which was also really good. 

We made it through 10 of the 22 tapas plates. My favorite was the waffle since it was nice and crispy, and my husband liked the steak and eggs so much that he ordered it twice. My least favorite was the Churro Tots, because I was expecting something crunchy like a churro while they were actually more like doughnut holes. 

We will definitely return to finish off the rest of the menu!
