The pollo trio de tacos is my all-time favorite taco. I wish I knew how this miracle was created. It tastes like the chicken is stewed in some magical blend of spices. Throw a little cilantro and onion on that over a corn tortilla, and i'm yours.

This is a lovely place, and everything i've had there has been delicious. i can never stay away for too long.
