Most restaurants get flustered with large parties, but we came here with a party of 14 for my father's bday and were treated amazingly! We had two waiters and several others check on us! The food is spectacularly delicious.  When you order the shrimp burrito,  you get a huge burrito filled with amazingly seasoned shrimp! The birthday tequila shot was thoroughly enjoyed by my dad! Will be back again and again!
