Ok! Got a $20 for $10 deal on Deal Chicken so I had no excuse not to come back and try the banana shake and rib taco I mentioned in my first review.
Ohhhh man, that shake is so good. Real chunks of banana in vanilla ice cream blended with banana syrup - it tastes like the best banana pudding you've ever had, only frozen. I'm a huge fan of banana anything (obviously) so this was a real treat for me. 
The short rib taco was street taco style with pickled cabbage, onion, and cilantro with some sauce. It was a little spicier than I expected (but I'm really sensitive when it comes to spiciness!) that was probably from the cojita and cremoso or whatever the meat was basted in. It was really good, though! Good thing I had the milkshake to wash it down with.
Got the same burger and fries as last time. Muy delicioso. 

What I assume is the owner was in again and is super friendly. He commented on my Star Trek shirt and we had a quick chat about the new film while my food was being prepared. 

The only con for me is that it's not near my house or anything I ever go to. I wish it was downtown!
