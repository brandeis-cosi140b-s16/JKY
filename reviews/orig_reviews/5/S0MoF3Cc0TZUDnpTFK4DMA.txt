Holy moly Batman these tacos were off the chain!!!! As a kid i spent a lot of time visiting TJ, and always filled up on tacos.  I would never expect to find them in nevada, so far from the boarder. But this place brougt back all those memories with one bite of a taco adobado.  The tortilla tasted freshly made, the meat was perfect, and the sauce topped it of!!!
