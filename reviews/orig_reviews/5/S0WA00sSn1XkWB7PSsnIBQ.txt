Service was great. The Philly tako was awesome. I thought portion size was great and good value.  My friend had the tako-tako which indicated was delicious. You can see into the kitchen and it was clean and busy. The ambiance was also fun And unique. Little to dark inside for me to see menu, but I'm sure that's not the case for everyone
