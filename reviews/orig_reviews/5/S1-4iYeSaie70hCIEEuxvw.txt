Pros: I have tried almost every dish (bulgogi burrito is my favorite) and I studied my board exams here.  If I had to decide my last meal, it would be at KoMex Fusion, because every dish has the perfect flavor profile.  I love their Nachos too.  They also have their own parking spots. 

Cons: none. They have a small kitchen and shorter staff, but they only have about 10 tables, so service is perfect.  However, you might need to wait in line if there's a rush.  

This is a "hole in the wall" restaurant and easily be missed.  I would give this restaurant 6 stars if I could!
I also do a lot of take-out orders from this place.
