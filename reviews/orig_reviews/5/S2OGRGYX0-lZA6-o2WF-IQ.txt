China Poblano. Asian and/or Mexican?Tomato Tomatoooo.

I was in Las Vegas for work recently. Vegas is not my favorite place. I'm not into seeing woman being pathetically objectified, losing money, or big flashing lights while I'm trying to catch my zzzzs.

That being said, the food in this town is outstanding! China Poblano was recommended to me by someone I met at a bar while in town. I had a friend accompany me on this dining adventure. And an adventure it was!

The restaurant is located in one of the fancier malls. Not the most elegant place, but colorful and cheery instead. The food is, as the waitress explained, "both Chinese and Mexican, not fusion." Okay, interesting!

We started with drinks... the Salt Air Margharita. Hands down, this is the best cocktail I've ever had. It was foamy and lovely and lightly salted and oh my! may I have another?  Apparently, they have a to-go window. You can walk right up and grab one of these spectular drinks as you puruse the fancy shops. 


Mexican cuisine was served first then the Chinese. Dish after dish. Different aromas, tastes. It was a trip around the world in my mouth. Heavenly!

I want to mention that the service was Incredible as well. 

For the perfect night, pair dinner at China Poblano with an after-dinner drink at the Chandelier bar next door. Yep, order fancy cocktails and listen to live jazz while sitting inside the largest chandelier. Too cool!
