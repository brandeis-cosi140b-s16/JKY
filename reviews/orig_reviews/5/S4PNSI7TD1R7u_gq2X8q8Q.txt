My experience at Cabo Wabo was Awesome!!! 

The hostess was friendly, the location and view was perfect (right on the strip),  the food was delicious (FYI... I had the shrimp enchiladas) and my waiter Danny M. was INCREDIBLE! He knew the menu like the back of his hand and was friendly and engaging. Definitely recommend! Ask for Danny M!
