yesterday was the second time eating there and omg it was fabulous again!! Tuesday is taco day and the food is so flavorful nothing i have had compares to this place. Fresh ingredients from the margarita tasting like it has fresh limes with no artificial flavors or additives-to the hand made tortillas, chips, salsa, churros, pulled pork, carne asada the list goes on and on-- get in here and try it for yourself you will not be dissapointed finally a great fresh flavorful place in Gilbert
