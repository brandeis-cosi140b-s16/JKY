AWESOME, even though we were the only ones there.... hope more people find this gem. 

Tacos are made fresh to order. You get your base, corn tortilla and protein and then you dress them up how YOU want.   

I tried one shrimp and one fish to get a baseline. Both were awesome... but I think the shrimp was the victor.

Make sure you get an order of fries so you can enjoy all the sauces. You absolutely must try mixing the cilantro cream with the Chipotle sauce.
