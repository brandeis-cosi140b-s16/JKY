Si Señor is definitely my absolute favorite Mexican restaurant... By far. I'm from New Mexico and ever since moving to Arizona, I hadn't found any great Mexican food... Until this place. I was raised on Mexican food and I can tell you that Si Señor is completely authentic New Mexican cuisine. I love getting the combination plate (#1). That way you get a bit of everything. And don't even get me started on the happy hour margaritas... But the chips and 4 different salsas are the best part!! I'll see you soon Si Señor!
