Tacos El Gordo is truly a hidden gem in Las Vegas!

Doesnt get more authentic than this, well it probably does, in the deep forests of Mexico.  Are there even forests in Mexico? Anyways, I love how there's more than just 2 meats.  Any place that has Suadero is a favorite of mine, and Tacos El Gordo has Suadero!  If you've never heard of it, try it! Trust me! It's meat so tender it'll make you wanna slap ya daddy AND ya mama!  

I had the massive carne asada fries, but I didn't know til after that you can get any type of meat you want on top of the fries.  I would have got their suadero. It's that good!  I usually just get the taco's now and maybe a sopes here and there but mainly the tacos.  It comes with grilled onions on request.  It always seems like they're constantly cooking, maybe because it's always so busy.
