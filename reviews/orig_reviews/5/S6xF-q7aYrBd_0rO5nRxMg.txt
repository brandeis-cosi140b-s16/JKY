My guy was on the fence about the Container park, said it seemed too hipster--UNTIL I took him there.  This place was first on my I must feed him this.... and I've converted him into a believer.  Their sopes AMAZING-I had a chicken burrito, and he ordered a carne asada one, they cut it in half for you too which is awesome and meant of course, that we could swap half and each have one, its rather affordable too since it was my turn to pay for dinner, I'm glad I didn't spend a ton.  Definitely recommend this place, they serve you your food outside you don't have to do anything! This is just sucha  cool place I'm glad its there.
