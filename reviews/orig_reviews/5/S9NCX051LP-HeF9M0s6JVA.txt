The homemade tortillas are amazing! I'm glad I came here. They won best tacos in Las Vegas 2014 and didn't disappoint. I was blown away by how much the homemade tortillas made a difference combined with the perfectly cooked carne asada! Nice friendly staff and very clean on the inside. Make sure you stop by and enjoy!
