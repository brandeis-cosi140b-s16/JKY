Once again !!! Excellent food ,service and hospitality. I'm not sure why people would give Chuy's a low rating... Not on the colors they choose to paint there walls or the fact that people let there kids run around the patio. Every place is different and unique. So to my Haters "Don't hate the player hate the game"******* I really don't think corporate will make any changes there to please a bunch of people that can't seem to appreciate change. Chuy's is Tex Mex.... NOT Authentic Mexican Food, so yes it's different. I can't imagine any good sense person to compare them to Taco Paco!!!!! R U Serious..... I'd rather go to a place where I feel welcomed rather then a place with high prices, mediocre food and boring decor. Lets keep it real PEOPLE!!! Rate these establishments for there food, service and location!!! Not cause you live in a overly expensive location and its not to your expectation!!!!!
