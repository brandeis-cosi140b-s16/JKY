A family owned GEM of a restaurant!  Worth the drive to Wickenburg!   Based upon some other reviews I got the Taco Salad and was not disappointed.  Everyone in our party was well taken care of, and all of the recipes were amazing.  Portion sizes were beyond fair and nobody went home hungry.  

Services was perfect, they clearly know how to run a restaurant!
