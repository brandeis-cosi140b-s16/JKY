This is a must when in Phoenix.  Best carne adovada ever!  The new place is even better with a great patio and outside bar; moreover, the keep with the feel of the old place.  Great food, great atmosphere, and spectacular service!   
LaDonna is phenomenal!  Have her make you a Jamaican Ten-Speed.  You'll love it!
