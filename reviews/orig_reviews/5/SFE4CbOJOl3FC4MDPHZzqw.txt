Awesome food, service, vibe, and sauces!
Great approachable menu with variety and veggie option.  Wonderful girl with short hair at the counter described items, offered extras and options and displayed a sense of ownership for the great grub they're providing. 
Excellent experience, wish I was going to be in Phoenix again soon.

Keep up the Awesomeness!
