Tried this restaurant for the first time today! Went with a couple friends and I honestly had no idea it was a new spot till the waiter told me. Well let's start off with the fact that we got there at 4ish so dinner was not yet ready (starts at 5) and we had to sit either by the bar or high top tables. I was a bit bothered by that since it was 3 of us and we were starving. I did not want to share a tiny small table, but we did anyways! 

Since the whole dinner thing and not being able to sit at a regular table did bother us at first. We just decided to only have an appetizer/drink and head on to another place but those minutes flew by and the appetizers came out so quick, we were very surprised. I ordered chicken tacos and even though they are super tiny they were AMAZING! Also the calamari was so flavorful. I asked the waitress to surprise me with a drink and she brought out a coconut beverage that was so good and had just the right amount of alcohol in it. We ended up waiting till 5 to move to a bigger table for dinner. No joke we ordered about 10 different plates and they were all wonderful! I had a second drink which was a coconut/pineapple margarita. The waiter did not mention it was frozen which I did not like but either way it was STRONG! (Very well worth your money if I may say so). Overall, service was great and so was everything else. The place is definitely very hip and modern!
