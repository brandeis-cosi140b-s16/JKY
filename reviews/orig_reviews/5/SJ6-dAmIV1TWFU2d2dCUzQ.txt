Sat at the bar, our bartender was very friendly and recommended some excellent drinks. Had trouble picking my favorite. Aroma de mujer, jalape√±o margarita &, a cucumber cilantro margarita were all divine. Our food was clean your plate good. The Cabo Azul plate has been one the best seafood platter I've ever had. You can't go wrong coming here. Look for the ropes that look like your sitting under a mushroom.
