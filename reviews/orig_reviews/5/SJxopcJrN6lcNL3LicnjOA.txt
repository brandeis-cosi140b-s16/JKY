OMG love this place. The food was awesome and so was our waiter Jeff. Took a cab from the Cosmo ($11.00) to Mandalay bay to eat here. It lived up to to the hype. I had the skirt steak. It was cooked perfectly. It came with a roasted corn and refried beans,also yummy. My partner had the short rib enchiladas and was very happy. The guacamole was very good also. We both had a jalape√±o margarita that was delicious. It was so good we almost went back the next night for dinner again. It's a must try when in Vegas. Next time  in Vegas I may have to book my stay at Mandalay bay just to be close to border grill!
