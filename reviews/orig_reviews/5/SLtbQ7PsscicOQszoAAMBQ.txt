The fish tacos here are freakin awesome.  I also had a dish that was a pepper stuffed duck and pomegranite that was soo good.  Again, Phoenix food is terrible except the mexican food (see review for Los Sombrero's).  Their isn't a lot of seating available so reservations are a plus.  Also, no chips and salse, instead bread and tapanade.  That loses some points, but the fish tacos and other food make up for it.  Desserts are so-so, but mexican dessert isn't really my thing.
