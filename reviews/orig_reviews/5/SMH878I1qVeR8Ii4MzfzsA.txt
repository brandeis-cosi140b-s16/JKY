I am a member of HolyTacoChurch.com. With many of my brothers and sisters in town for Phoenix Comicon, it was only right that we take a pilgrimage to the Taco Guild and its church building. 

Oh, and the Taco Guild is indeed blessed.

Our party took us half the restaurant, it seemed, and yet the service was excellent. The chunky pineapple-mint guacamole and the queso were superb with the chips. And hello, happy hour! I like margaritas but they aren't my favorite, but the frozen margarita there was a potent delight.

I selected three tacos: pork adovada, Yucatan shrimp, and grilled seasonal vegetable. The pork was awesome. I've tried many of the highly-rated taco places around, and this pork is now rated among the best. In part, this is because it was finely shredded and very easy to eat. No big chunks falling out all over.

The shrimp taco was the most disappointing of the lot--the hot sauce overwhelmed any other flavor, even though it didn't have much of a kick. Even so, it was quite edible, and much better than tacos at other places.

I LOVED the vegetable taco. The texture was perfection--crisp, with lots of flavor.

For my free side, I got a house side salad with a chipotle vinaigrette (I think). I was pleased with how large the salad was, and the dressing was unique and good.

This is my new favorite taco place in Phoenix. The food and ambience can't be beat. Sadly, my friends have now scattered across the country, but now I can drag my family here whenever we're in the vicinity of downtown. I must share the sanctity of this place.
