Small place and an hour after opening it was already full when we got there so I was already eager to try their food out. 

Their customer service is great, they bring the food out to you even though it's not really a big deal I thought it was pretty sweet. 

I got the paradise burger with bacon and cheese and unlike other places, the bacon here was chewable. I loved it! And whatever they put on top of the burger (it's something pink) I thought it was odd at first but it was just perfect. Their fries are also really good and seasoned. Overall a really good place!
