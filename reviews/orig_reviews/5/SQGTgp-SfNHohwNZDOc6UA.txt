I enjoy coming to Joyride on Tuesday for the Happy Hour.  They have $2 tacos and $5 margaritas from 3-close. My favorite tacos and margaritas are the Carne Asada and Braised Beef tacos and the Cucumber Serrano and the watermelon margarita.  

The service here is always amazing and fantastic.  Everyone that works there is always in a awesome mood and they are always smiling too.

You should totally try out Joyride if you can.
