I thought 5 stars on yelp for that many reviews?  Well it is true. It is a 5 hands down!  If this place had beer and good margaritas it would be the very best. 

First of all- not that who is running the place matters on the taste of the food- but the people running the place are great. We had never been here and they jumped right in to have is try all the different meats for our meal. I ordered things i never would have because I tried it first. 

The atmosphere is all about Mexican wrestlers and the decor is fun and eclectic.  At first you wonder what the place is all about- Especially is in strip mall. 

The food is delicious and spectacular. I wish we lived here so we could come all the time. The prices are very good.  The meat is shredded which is easier to eat and is braised  in the most delicious juices.  Everything is incredibly fresh.   Excellent experience.
