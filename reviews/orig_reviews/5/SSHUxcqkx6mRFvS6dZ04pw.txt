Love this new place in Arcadia!  It's versatile, great for work lunch, happy hour with friends, or date night out on the town.  The food is great - evidenced by the many, many trophies in the entrance.  They are well deserved!     

My favorite:  The costilla (short rib) tacos or tostadas. Don't pass up the chips & Guacamole - so good!   I've tried the Alitas (wings) - they defintely have some heat, so be prepared!  

The portions are perfect, they are small - medium range.  I love the deco, the tree on the wall is amazing!     

Definitely catch this place whenever you are in Arcadia!
