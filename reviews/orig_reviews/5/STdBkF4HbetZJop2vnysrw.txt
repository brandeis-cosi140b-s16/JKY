A friend recommended this spot for a Monday happy hour and this is one of Gilbert's best kept secrets. Sure, the hot spots, blue 32, Harvey's, etc. are the obvious choices. But next time you're faced with packed parking lots and lack of seating, give Isabel's a try. It's delicious and we had a really good time.
