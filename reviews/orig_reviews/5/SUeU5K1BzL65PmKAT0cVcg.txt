Driving by this place several times I have never stopped, that is until yelp came along! We looked this place up on yelp and they get great reviews so my boyfriend and I decided to give it a try for lunch one day and man am I happy we did!! The carne asada tacos are great; I also ordered a chicken tostada that was delicious. My boyfriend ordered a fish taco, carne asada burrito and a molote (masa fritter with potato and chorizo) all of them were great. The price is cheap & the food is fresh. It's small inside and gets a little warm on a hot summer day but it's still worth it. Don't be put off by the outside appearance & give Tacos Atoyac a try!
