This place is super awesome! The service was great! Very attentive! The food was absolutely on point. Order the shrimp fajitas and they were delicious! Drinks were amazing and at a reasonable price! Homemade tortillas were delicious! Ugh loved it here! Would highly recommend this restaurant to my friends!
