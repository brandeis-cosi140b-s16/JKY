Aside from the fact that my doctor and dentist are in Henderson, Las Cazuelas might be the next best reason for me to return to this far away town. It's a small mom and pop shop in the sprawling strip mall with Target and Freed's Bakery. Order at the counter, take a seat and the food will be brought out to you. While you wait, complimentary chips and salsa are provided. The enchiladas de mole poblano ($7) are an excellent bargain. As with any good mole, there's a wide range of flavors with heat, smokiness and a subtle sweetness to it. The four corn tortillas were filled with shredded chicken, covered in mole and topped with cotija cheese, onions, and roasted sesame seeds.

Despite the modest interior the food is much more refined than a typical quick/casual Mexican spot. There's a level of passion and precision in the execution of the food that you won't find at similar restaurants -- all the more reason to make the jaunt to the other side of the valley.
