Buzzed or walking the strip drunk? tacos el gordo is the place to go for a late night craving. All the times I have gone (weekday or weekend) they have been busy. This hole in the wall offers indoor and outdoor seating. They have one of the top street tacos in Vegas. Its located right off the side of circus circus and the wynn. 

The tacos are $2 a piece and are loaded with meat, salsa, cilantro onions and possibly pineapple if you get the pastor tacos. They also ask if you would like grilled onions and jalapenos on the side. The lines are quick and the cooks don't waste time standing around, if your not ready to order move aside. The roasted and marinating meat are waiting to be chowed down on.
