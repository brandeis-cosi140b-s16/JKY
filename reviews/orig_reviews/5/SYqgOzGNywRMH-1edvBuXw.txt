My wife and I have eaten here twice in the last two weeks. On both occasions, we were greeted promptly and with great enthusiasm by our server Dyana who provided the best care and service we've ever had. Furthermore,  manager Marlo stopped by to check on us and provided amazing customer service. On our second visit, we asked for Dyana and not only did she remember our names she remembered our order from our first visit. Marlo stopped by again, and without missing a step continued off from where we'd left off a week prior. Food was amazing both times and everything was clean and spotless. Bathrooms are downstairs, limiting bathroom traffic where you're eating and they were super clean! I would recommend this location to anyone, any time. Looking forward to our next visit and ready to try a mix and match taco combo!
