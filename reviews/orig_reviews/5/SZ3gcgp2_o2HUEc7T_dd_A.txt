Fantastic lunch this week.  The cornbread was fresh out of the oven and tasty.  Chips and Queso were fantastic.  I had the Diablo Pasta with jerk chicken for my entree and loved it.  My lunch guests tried the chicken and steak fajitas and thought they were fantastic!  No margaritas this time but love them!  John the manager was super friendly and helpful.  Great service and great food!  We will be back!
