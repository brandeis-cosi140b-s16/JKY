My bf loves mexican food and we came here before the One show.

It was a Saturday night around 7 and we got a table right away.  Once we were seated, the water came to our table as did the chips.  Idk what it is about their tortilla chips, but they are delicious!

We ordered the spicy black bean dip..they were good but def not spicy at all!
For entrees, we got the carne asada quesadillas and the wagyu beef tacos.  Both dishes were scrumptious.

Prices were pretty high for mexican food, especially coming from SD =P
But it was worth it!

Pretty dark in the main dining area, but the light shining off the wall was bright..which made me squint.  But really, the meal made it 5 stars. I don't care for the ambiance.  Service was also good and tentative, in the perfect amount.
