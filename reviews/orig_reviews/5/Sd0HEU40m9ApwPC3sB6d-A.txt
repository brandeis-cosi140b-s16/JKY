This is the best mexican store in Pittsburgh, I try to go there once a week to get all my favorite ingredients.... key limes $2.39 for a 2lb bag... guayabas... avocados...1.19 ea... cilantro 99 cents... white and yellow tortillas... prices are very reasonable and the store has a good selection of mexican products, piniatas...cookies, bread, beans and salsas.... I even find my Takis here.

The meats are great... chorizo, cesina, carne al pastor... and the carnitas are very good too. They have tamales too for 99 cents each.

They sell tacos in the front and if you ask they will give you a free sample for the meats...
