I'm very hard to please when it comes to street tacos being that I'm Mexican but Tacos El Gordo is as real as it gets the only downside is the price. 2$ for a taco that is as small as my palm is a little ridiculous. Although they are a little pricey they are worth it. It's a very fast paced environment inside the restaurant for such a small space but ehhh we can manage.
