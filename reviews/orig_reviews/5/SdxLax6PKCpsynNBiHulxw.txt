If I don't come here for Taco Tuesday, my whole week is shot. The California style  burritos and tacos, the fresh salsas, and the aguas frescas keep me coming back at least once a week. It's delicious, fast, and cheap, with friendly staff who will remember your order if you're a regular, even though the place does a lot of business.
