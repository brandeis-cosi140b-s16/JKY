Our server whipped up some guacamole that was just divine (if you agree that slightly supple, perfectly ripe avocados bring you closer to your chosen God anyhow), and the small talk he made whilst combining fresh lime juice and pico de gallo, avocados and onions, struck me as genuine and pleasant. He actually provided the friendliest, most timely restaurant service during my entire Vegas stay. Huzzah.

The Mahi Mahi salad is filling and well-balanced. The ceviche, though lacking in scallops, glides down your gullet with the greatest of ease. Their free baskets of chips are lovingly sprinkled with cayenne seasoning, too.

And don't forget the snazzy pink and lime decor, bold without jarring the senses. The rest of Vegas, you could take a lesson from this place! Actually, Vegas, I want you to dance 18 inches apart from this gal and keep your hands to yourself. She still seems so darling and fresh-faced.

PS: This place is in Planet Hollywood.
