I love happy hour!  3PM to 6PM EVERYDAY! This place has one of, if not, THE BEST!!! $4 Grilled Chicken Quesadillas, YES!!  Plus $4 or $5 for a mile high pile of Green Chile  Chicken Nachos?  YES!!!  And if you really want a treat...$9 for 3 huge fillet Mignon Tacos.  Plus COLD BEER both bottle and tap plus reasonable mixed drink prices.  Place is friendly, bar plays classic rock, most patrons seem to be regulars...once you eat there, you will be too!  Friendly staff especially Hostess Judith and the young man with the red hair.  I've been in the restaurant  related business for 30 years, the prime phrase is CONSISTANCY and the food, atmosphere and friendly people are always consistant.  Consistantly great.  The owner, Andrew, always makes a point to great everybody.  New Orleans Bartender exudes Southern Hospitality.  Regular Menu is a bit pricey, portions could be larger, but food is great.
