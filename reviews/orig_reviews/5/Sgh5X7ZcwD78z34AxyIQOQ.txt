I only come here for Happy Hour...Then again every hour is happy hour..lol Seriously thought they have the BEST carne asada around in the valley. And ive had my share of carne asada...I am mexican. Street tacos which are mini tacos...Only $4 during happy hour...Carnitas are amazing as well. Margaritas are decent but even for Happy Hour $5 is kinda high...Service is great. Last time they failed to send a waiter or waitress to me...I complained and the manager apologized and gave me %50 off. Was not expecting that but i'll take it!
