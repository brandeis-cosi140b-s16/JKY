As a local, I rarely make it to the strip. We went to the Venetian to see the Blue Man Group (tewtelly awesome, btw!) and we had to eat first. Not wanting to spend an arm and leg for the lamb brains served at Mario Batali's (ew!) we decided to go to Taqueria Canonita instead.

I see this as a sort of fusion restaurant - mixing Mexican traditions with  European and American cooking techniques to make something that is new and affordable while still being special. It made me think of what might be eaten in Mexico City for  a normal (and maybe a bit bourgeois) night out. Instead of covering everything in greasy cheeses and diced tomatoes, the Taqueria Canonita emphasizes different tastes of Mexican cuisine put together in unique ways.

We had:
Queso Fundido con Raja - a favorite of ours, we always get it at Lindo Michoacan. The tortillas were handmade and divine. The cheese was top-notch, but not too stringy.

Enselada de Cangrejo - salad with lump blue crab meat and a creamy jalapeno dressing. Honestly, what's not to like?

Michoacan Pork Chop - Wow! Just... wow. The pork chop was juicy, tender, and delicious. The reduction over the mushroom hominy (polenta/grits) was magical. 

Tequila - served in a beautiful glass and a full selection of blancos, repasados and anejos. 

Mojito - admittedly, not a Mexican drink. But I don't care. It rocked my socks.

Also, the service was excellent and very friendly. We sat on the "patio" which gave us a nice view of the "canal" and the singing gondola folks.
