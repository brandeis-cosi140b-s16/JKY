Two good friends and I met here for lunch today! Don't let the shared entrance with Sapphires Gentleman's Club throw you off. The entrance is before the club but, they share the parking lot.  We were greeted immediately and led to our table. Valerie was our attentive server, who was ready for our questions and also gladly took some substitutions on my order.
El Dorado Cantina did not disappoint. Delicious,organic GMO free selections from a great varied menu. The cilantro rice is to die for as well as the Seafood enchilada stuffed with shrimp, scallops and Mahi Mahi . We also had the cheese enchiladas and pork burrito. Everything done perfectly. The manager checked on us twice and we could not be more pleased. If you check in on Yelp, you get a free serving of Chef Paco's Flan! So delicious. When he came out after we were finished dining, he said the recipe was his Mother's. Not sure I should share but, he also told us that as locals, there are 50% off specials on Mondays. Be sure to make a reservation as it gets really busy. They also post special events on Facebook, like the March on Monsanto 5/23. Follow them on Facebook and you can be up to date! My new favorite Mexican restaurant. Food, varied selection and service were all 5 Star!
