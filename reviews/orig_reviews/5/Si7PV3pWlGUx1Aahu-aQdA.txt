Found Salsa Blanca about a year ago and so glad I did. I'm a big fan of Mexican food and this place has never let me down. I've tried many things on the menu and without fail I have never left hungry. Portion size is great as well as food quality. The entire staff is very friendly and they all seem to help each other. I've seen the owners bring out food many times and casually stroll the eating area seeing if everything is good and if there is anything else you need. The entire staff is always sure to greet someone coming in and thanking them when they leave. Give it a try and see for yourself. I love the Carne Asada burrito and the Nachos. Great enchilada's and the deserts are to die for. I've been there for lunch and they do have a lunch special and Happy Hour most nights as well. If you're a Margarita fan, try one of their flavored ones, they are delicious! So glad they found the location they did because I know where I head for a quick and tasty bite.
