This place was recommended to me by a friend and I wanted to check it out on my work trip in March 2009.  Well at the end of the work day we were all scratching our heads about where to get dinner so I suggested we try out Los Sombreros.  We had a party of 11 people and I felt a little pressure going in just because if it was bad then I wouldn't hear the end of it.  When setting up the reservation the person on the phone was easy to deal with and he called me back after my initial call because he wasn't sure about being able to fit us in on this busy Wednesday evening .

The overall experience of Los Sombreros was exactly what I was hoping for.  We had to sit inside on because of our group size, but it was fine.  The service was good, they had two servers working our table. The margaritas with fresh lime juice were really tasty.  Guacamole was incredible.  My crab enchiladas came and wow I was in heaven, even the sides I ordered of vegetables and black beans were full of flavor.  I think EVERYONE in our group liked their dinners, so I felt pretty cool for a few minutes at least. 

All in all one of the best Mexican meals I've ever had.  I live in Michigan and we don't get this kind of food up here.  

One note: Not many options for vegetarians.
