I knew when I moved to Phoenix I would experience some top-notch Mexican food,but Barrio exceeded all expectations. The guacamole is one of a kind and CANNOT be missed. I had the shrimp tacos and they were perfection!  The cabbage was crisp the shrimp was perfectly cooked and the sauce was magnificent. This is the place I will bring all of my out of town guests!
