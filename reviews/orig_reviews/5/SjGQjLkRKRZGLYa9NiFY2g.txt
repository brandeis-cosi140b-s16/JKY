This place is so popular! For non-natives, this is essentially a combination of chinese and mexican food~ They serve mexican dishes with chinese inspiration. With that said, the lady who helped us was SO nice. I was having some trouble filling out the menu (theres a little menu that you fill out and just give to the cashier) Our food came out relatively quickly. Being a fatty, I ordered the 2 item combination with jade chicken (orange chicken with a bit of a kick) and a quesadilla with hengrenade chicken (supposed to be a not as spicy version of jerk chicken) with black beans and white rice. It was quite delicious! The portions were good, not too large but big enough where I couldn't finish it all. The beans were interesting as they were pureed (usually when you order black beans they come out whole) and it does come with cheese on the top. The hengrenade chicken was really delicious inside of the quesadilla and the jade chicken was quite good! (I was just expecting regular orange chicken but I was suprised by the slight spiciness). Overall, I thought it was good for the price, the service was good. It wasn't the cleanest looking restaurant (though if you were expecting a very mexican-ish restaurant like those you find in california, that's what you'll get!) I did quite like it and I would come back again next time I'm in the area!
