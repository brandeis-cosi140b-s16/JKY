Wow! I'll keep it simple. This small homey Mexican restaurant has the best service I have ever experienced. The best mexican food ever! Everything is made from scratch, the flavors burst in your mouth and everything comes out piping hot! Order the Baja chicken burrito or the patio chimi!
The salsa is amazing, ask for the hot stuff....so good! 
Order the maragarita or ice cold can of tecate!
Oh and every time I have been out waiter brings us a complimentary shot from the bar! 
Take your friends and family here, you'll never go anywhere else.
