This has to be the best place in town!  I was told about it by a friend and then some of the people in my office mentioned it and I can't believe that I waited as long as I did (like 2 weeks) to try this place out.  It is AMAZING!  The fresh made guacamole at your table is fantastic and the street tacos are marinated to perfection.  I had the enchiladas and they were divine!  I really like the rice that they use because it is full of flavor and doesn't look burnt.  The black beans also had great flavor and we're very good!  All around, the experience was great and the service was friendly and quick.  Now, this place could be judged by the fact that it is literally next to a huge strip club, but I don't care because I will be back with my family members in the very near future.  I think this is one of my favorite spots in the Las Vegas valley!  You should stop reading this and just tell your navigation to go there!!
