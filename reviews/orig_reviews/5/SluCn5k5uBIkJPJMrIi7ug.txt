If you live in south Chandler, or don't mind the drive, this is the place for a nice sit-down, authentic Mexican meal.

Anything on the menu with Hatch Chiles will make your toes tap and your lips smack. The shrimp tacos are a personal favorite, and for breakfast/brunch, the eponymous "La Casa Blanca" is absolutely fabulous.

Chips and salsa are a staple at most Mexican restaurants, but here they are both fresh and delish, but careful not to fill up before your appetizers and entr√©es arrive. The chips are all complimentary and the salsa and bean dips are yummy, but nothing compared to the treats the kitchen will ultimately deliver.

What's the downside? It is always my intention to order the sopapillas for dessert, but I never seem to leave room. The rare occasions when I do, however, even these are especially good here.

By the way, this is a big restaurant with lots of parking, and lots of indoor and patio seating -- plus some great original artwork and sculpture to enjoy. All around, a great dining experience.
