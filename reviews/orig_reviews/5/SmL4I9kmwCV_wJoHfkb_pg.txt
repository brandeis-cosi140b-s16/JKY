drove 20+ mins for these tacos (to try for the first time) i was craving some homemade tortilla tacos and it was worth it. I order a chorizo (not in the menu) taco and they gladly made it for me. I will definitely be back. 
one thing i wish they had *handmade agua fresca* 
maybe in the future abuela's tacos? maybe
