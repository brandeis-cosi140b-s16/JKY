Well yesterday i was a total chicken junkie. I wanted more after I devoured 4 pieces. Seriously the best grilled chicken I think I have ever had. Yes, i had major munchies but this is beside the point. It was seriously beyond satisfying and I need more in my system this week. Beautiful red skin and delicious juicy interior. I'm freaking hooked.
 You get two choices people, just TWO. If you can only have two options on your menu, you know it has to be freaking fantastic and it is. They have perfected the grilled bird and I am so grateful I stopped in. 
Beans, tortilla, salsa, chicken...this girl couldn't have asked for more. 


Sometimes less is truly more.

Seriously BOMB!
