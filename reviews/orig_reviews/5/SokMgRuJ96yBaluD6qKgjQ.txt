I went by myself on a Saturday evening. I got there around 6pm and the place was pretty much totally packed, with a wait. However, they have a very tiny bar with a few chairs, so I was able to grab a spot there.

Parking was a bit stressful. There are only a small handful of spots in front of the building. The nearby neighborhood does allow free parking but some of the locals seem to have put up their own "no parking" spots in front of their house, so the neighborhood seems a little less than friendly.

The menu itself features a wide array of tacos, including some great fish options (I had a shark taco which was quite good). They also have some typical street tacos such as carne asada. The highlight may actually be their salsa bar, which features over a dozen unique different salsa flavors (there are some typical flavor and then some strange ones like peanut, cilantro, etc.). But beware, almost all of them are pretty spicy! The chips are pretty standard, but having such a wide array of salsa choices (and the ability to just go get them yourself whenever you want) really makes it a great experience.

My favorite part of the meal may have actually been the horchata. I have had tons of horchata in my life, but La Santisima features a very unique combination that includes real chopped fruit. It was very refreshing, and the portion size is a huge 32 oz.

All in all, this was a great meal. It is definitely worth trying to find a parking spot (and waiting for a table)!
