I gave this place 5 stars 2 years ago when it was Super Mex ( always thought that was a dumb name) . I'm pleased to say now that it is Jalisco Cantina (better name) the food is just as good if not better. Fantastic salsa, delicious yellow rice and wonderful flavors throughout the menu. Also love the new festive paint colors they chose for the interior, one of our favorite places for Mexican food!
