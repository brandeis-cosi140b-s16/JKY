This place is soooo delicious. Other reviews were what made me choose this place and I was NOT disappointed. Well, I was slightly disappointed when I found out that they didn't have any menudo. If you want menudo then make sure you come on Sat or Sun morning. Otherwise the caldo de res is a must!!

**update: I did go back for menudo and it was AWESOME!!  Next time I am in Vegas I am coming back to this restaurant.
