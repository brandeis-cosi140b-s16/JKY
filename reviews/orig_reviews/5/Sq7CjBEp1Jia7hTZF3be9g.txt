I fully expected to be let down from after reading all the hype online.  I wasn't.  While I still can't really describe all the different types of food, it doesn't matter.  My taste buds were confused...but happy.  Right when we walked in, the dude was really excited to see us.  He gave us samples of what was popular, as well as what he liked.  VERY good service to match the food.  Change up your routine, and give this place a try.
