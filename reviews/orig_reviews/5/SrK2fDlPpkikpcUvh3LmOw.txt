It's easy to get used to a food so much that you don't want to eat it again for months but Tacos El Gordo is different. Tacos El Gordo is life changing. It is a whole new level of tacos. Tacos El Gordo makes you want to eat tacos every day and not regret it. It's a place I'd take my mom to for her birthday. I'll probably eat there for Thanksgiving.
