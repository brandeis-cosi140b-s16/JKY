This place deserves a visit.  You love Mexican.  I love Mexican.  but face it... we've both been lazy haven't we.  we go to the 'berto's places. we have our favorite Tex-Mex neighborhood joints.  and maybe we got a wild hair and went to La Parilla Suiza for a different style of Mexican food.  but we haven't pushed the envelope, and it's time we did!  so get yourself over to Sunnyslope and try Los Reyes de la Torta.  First of all, brace yourself.... you will not get chips and salsa.  and when you look at the menu, you won't see your fave burritos or tacos offered.  get over it.  your mouth is about to be the happiest part of your body!  they offer a wide variety of "tortas" (sandwiches to you, gringo) and like any good sandwich place, you order them with "The Works".  At Los Reyes, that means a whole pile of ingredients and they're all suicculent.  Agua Fresca?  Just say yes and name a fruit... within moments, a giant margarita style glass will be placed in front of you containing a smoothie based on aforementioned fruit plus a giant garnish of same.  I ordered the Mango version and cannot remember ever sipping  a more satisfying, delicious concoction, which went perfectly with my torta choice, the Del Rey torta, large enough to pose a serious challenge to Adam Richman on Man vs. Food.  In my case, Food won, but the torta, containing pork, ham, beef, eggs, guacamole, onions, tomatoes, cheese, chorizo, and yes even a hot dog, was a glutton's wet dream.  I suggest you come with a group of at least 6 people so you can order a bunch of different things and share them around.
Try this place.
