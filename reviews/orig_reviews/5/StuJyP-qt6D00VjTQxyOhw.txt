The Border Grill in Mandalay Bay is perhaps my favorite upscale Mexican restaurant.  The food and drink specials are always amazing and a great choice. The last time we went, we got the queso fundido which I couldn't get enough of and for my main course, I got some very tasty taquitos.  One thing that sets the Border Grill apart from your run of the mill Mexican restaurant is the sophistication of the flavors.   They are always light, fresh, and delicious.
