I love this place! Consistently delicious. Don't be fooled by the outside, this place is a gem. The chips are thin and yummy and their salsa ROCKS!!! My husband and I eat here at least once a week. It's cheap, clean and service is good. Plus, they leave you with a nice parting gift -  a cinnamon sugar 'cookie'.  We try other Mexican places and every time, we say the same thing, "damn, we should have gone to El Bravo." I am addicted.
