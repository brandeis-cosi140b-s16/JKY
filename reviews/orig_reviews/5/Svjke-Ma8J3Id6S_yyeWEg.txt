I've almost everything on the menu and you can't go wrong ordering anything here. I am a huge red chile lover and I swear Valle Luna has the best red chile in town! I just recently tried the green chile and that's fabulous too! Now my biggest dilemma is do I go with the red or green chile? First world problems.
