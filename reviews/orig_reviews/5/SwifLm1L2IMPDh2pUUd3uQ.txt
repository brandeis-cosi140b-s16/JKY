It doesn't get better than this. The food here is delicious and almost magical.

I Ordered the Chicken fried rice, with refried beans, Jade red chicken and Teriyaki chicken. It was perfect. The Jade red chicken is perfectly sweetened and damn right delicious. The beans were almost like the one's i grew up eating. This is a must try if you're ever in the phoenix area!
