I've now eaten here twice and tried all of their tacos. Joyride has amazing food, amazing staff and the cutest decor! 

I like to sit outside on the patio- which often puts you at risk for being forgotten- but not here! The staff is bubbly, helpful and checks in often! 

Everything I have tried here has been gorgeous, the presentation and flavor of each dish makes it hard to choose- but my favorites right now are the standard chicken and baja fish tacos!

I also would like decorate my house like that place haha! 
I think I will try the agua fresca next time :)
