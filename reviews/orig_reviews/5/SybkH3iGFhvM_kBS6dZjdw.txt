This place...this. place. Amazing. The flavors were SO bold, and our waiter, Kyle, had charisma and candor to spare. The pineapple ginger and strawberry coconut mojitos were to die for, and the grouper--Kyle's personal fave--was ridiculously buttery and flaky. I strongly recommend you come...hungry.
