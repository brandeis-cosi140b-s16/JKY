I have been searching for many years for a chile relleno as yummy as my dad makes...and finally found it here! Their food is not nearly as spicy as I prefer, but it was delicious! 

The chips & salsa were fresh & flavorful, and my prickly pear margarita on the rocks was made with real juice (not syrup!). Their beer selection was a bit disappointing. 

The atmosphere is beautiful & relaxing, and refreshingly quiet, considering it's right in the middle of a tourist area. Lots of parking in the back & easy to walk to the nearby shops. 

Can't wait to come back to AZ & try ALL of their locations :)
