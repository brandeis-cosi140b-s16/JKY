3pm on a Tuesday. 
Waitress is on top of her game. The service was perfect.
Agua de avena is delicious.
Torta Del Rey is absolutely a killer. My taste buds were going into a frenzy from all angles, ham one second, avocado, breaded beef, beans, sausage, cheese, soft bread salsa roja. 
For desert I got an esquimo. I wasnt a fan of this to me it taste like strawberry quik. Next time I'll have a different desert.

This place lives up to its hype.
