Food, drinks and service were all top notch! Had an amazing first experience. Staff was great and very attentive. Came for a friend's birthday and the owner went above and beyond to make sure we had a great experience. Will definitely be back and recommend this place to everyone looking for a relaxed, awesome taco and marg experience!!
