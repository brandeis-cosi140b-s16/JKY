Aye caramba   I am FULL.  Went here on a suggestion from a co-worker and saw the great reviews so was a little afraid the bar was set so high they couldn't possibly match what I was thinking.  Well they did.... Carlos our server was awesome, so personable, attentive without being overbearing, answered every question and was, well, simply a great waiter. Martin our beverage and table clearer (okay i know there is a name for them but can't think of it right now), was just as friendly and on the spot. I don't think our water ever emptied. 
I got the two item combo.... a cheese enchilada and a chili colorado burrito. The enchilada was spot on, cheesy and dreamy with the right amount of sauce and seasoning and the chili colorado was the bomb. Nice bite size chunks of meat and a tinge of spice to the sauce but not overwhelming.  My husband who isn't really a mexican food kind of guy got the carne asada burrito and he absolutely loved it. Said we can go there anytime, which is music to my  ears because Mexican is my favorite food. Guess being from San Diego it kind of has to be :)  I would definitely and will recommend this place and we will definitely be repeat customers.
