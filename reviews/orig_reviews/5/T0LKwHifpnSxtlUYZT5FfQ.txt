Sometimes you need to wash Christmas down with a margarita. Yesterday, I did just that. Both finding ourselves with the day off and nothing to do but mill around downtown, the hubs and I stopped in late afternoon for a little happy hour, which they have daily (sweet bonus!) 

We sat at the bar because we're those kind of people and the TV behind the bar was playing National Lampoon's Vacation... The house marg was way tasty. They are served in a short glass, which is good because they go down eaaaaasy. We had chips and salsa and that salsa is spicy and perfect. Amazing. We weren't exceptionally hungry but ordered some flautas. If these little gems are any indication of the level of tastiness of all the items on the menu, I may move in. Literally, like bring a label maker over there and declare a bar stool mine. 

We chatted with Kevin who was working behind the bar. Cool dude. Great 'stache. Here's where they made us want to be regulars: Kevin introduced himself and asked our names and then called us by our names to see if we needed another cocktail. I love that kind of service. He gave us some great info about the menu and happenings, too.

They have events and live music certain days and what looks to be a great brunch on the weekends. The outdoor patio looks nice (it was a bit chilly yesterday) and is dog friendly which is another bonus. You can bet we'll be back and bring a huge appetite!
