I've been here two times since this location opened, and I will definitely be back. The food is incredible and the service is great. The flautas are delicious! You can get a
combination of meats in each of the flautas. I tried the pork, the beef, and the chicken. The pork is definitely the standout though all three were delicious. I love all the sauces they offer. The green one is my fave! I wish they would put it in squirt bottles though to avoid cross contamination from previous customers.
