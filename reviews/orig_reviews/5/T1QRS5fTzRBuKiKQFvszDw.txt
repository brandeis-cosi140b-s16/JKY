Tia Rosas deserves a full five star rating because of the awesomely priced happy hour and the amazing food and service I had at normal dinner hours tonight (Sat October 25). Tonight my server was,  I believe,  named Spencer who gave plentiful information for all the dishes we questioned. He even answered some questions about the other location (which is gone now) and overall was an awesome guy! I will continue to go here as long as service will be this good and prices stay this low! Oh! One More thing, the atmosphere is cozy and very detailed.
