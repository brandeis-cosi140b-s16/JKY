SO sad I can't remember my server's name!  
My friend and I decided to hit up Old Town, and started with dinner here.  AMAZING service and friendly staff.  
We took forever catching up and talking that we had to ask for "a minute" like, 4 times, but our server was extremely helpful, joked with us, and gave us recommendations to think about while we chatted. 
We ended up taking his recommendations for the margarita trio.  I had the standard, a special summertime one, and honestly, i don't even remember what the third one was.  They were all fantastic!  and not too sugary, nor watery.
Dinner was equally delicious.  I ordered the Ahi Tuna Salad.  Great size and wonderful flavors!   My meal was big, but didn't make me too full - perfect for our plans to go to the bars later.  No one wants a crazy full stomach in a Scottsdale bar!
Coming back for sure!
