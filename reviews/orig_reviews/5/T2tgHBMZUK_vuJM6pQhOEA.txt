I have been to Ricardo's quite a few times.  Although not in the best part of town, the restaurant inside makes you forget the surroundings.

I have been there for Happy Hour and dinner.  Happy Hour is great!  You can have the drinks and any of the appetizers for HALF PRICE!  You can really eat a lot for very little.  Most of the appetizers are a lot of food.  One appetizer can be a meal.  

There are flat screen TV's with closed caption at every booth.  Really cool.  It is a great place to hang alone or with friends.    

You definitely have to try it! 

P.S. The dinners are great and priced just right.  Service is good too.
