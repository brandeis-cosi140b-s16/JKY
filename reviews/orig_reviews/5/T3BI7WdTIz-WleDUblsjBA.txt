They have like  9+ salsas or sauces (all amazing) and EVERY type of meat  you would find at a great street taco stand. Pastor, saudero, asada, pollo, cabeza, cesos,lengua, carnitas, buche, chicharron, chorizo etc.  They do corn two ways, but elote mexicano with  Mayo, parmesan  and Chile  is the best.

 It is like if a taco stand  and chipotle had a child. BEST MEXICAN FOOD I HAVE HAD IN PAST  15 YEARS. I grew up in Hatch NM and So CA so I know good mexican food and this is IT !

Vampiro Taco was great, no salsa so it traveled well on a to-go order, some pastor tacos, chicken nachos and an elote mexicano estilo. Great Dinner!
