I absolutely LOVE Tacos El Gordo! If I'm picking a tacos spot it's this one or sometimes I just have a craving for Al Pastor (with a slice of pineapple). Everybody I've brought here enjoy it too. My brother is a tacos freak and when he came to visit I immediately took him here. If you're looking for some high class, sit down tacos place you're at the wrong place. It's bleak but has way more sitting then the old location on the strip. But who cares about appearance it's the food that matters to me!
