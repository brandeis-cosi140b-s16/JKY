After a little over an hour stuffing snacks into plastic bags under Three Square's Backpacks program, my coworkers and I headed down the street to Viva Zapatas. Even though we showed up about 45 minutes early for our reservation, they already had our table ready and were happy to seat us!

The awesome staff never let our drinks get less than half full, which meant a lot of running around for them that did not go unappreciated. They brought out all ten of our orders at once, hot but not so hot that we couldn't dig in immediately. The salsa is fabulous here--it's hotter than most restaurants I've been to, and peppery to boot! LOTS of choices on the menu, plus a whole bunch of lunch specials.

The only downside I can think of is their squishy, uneven parking lot, but my boss managed to navigate it in his pick-up, so I guess it's not an issue.

Service is great, food is great, bathrooms are clean (check out the sinks!) Absolutely will be back next time I volunteer at Three Square. :)
