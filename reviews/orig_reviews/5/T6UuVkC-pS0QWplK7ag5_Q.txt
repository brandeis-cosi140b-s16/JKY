Hidden away behind a sea of strip malls, this restaurant is a contradiction of itself in a great way. It's Asian and Mexican. It's really fast food, yet everything tastes fresh. The menu board is all pictures and cheap like a 'berto's stand, but the place is big and clean. The tables and chairs are plastic and foldout, but there's a big plasma TV and pictures hanging on the wall. But most important; the food is cheap and fantastic! 

We walked in and I looked at the big menu board in awe. There more than a dozen items listed, and four ways to have them. The combo is any two items with beans and rice. You can also have them wrap up any item in a burrito. Any item served in a quesadillas. Or a single item rice bowl. My girlfriend told the guy at the register that I had never been there before, and he asked me what I was interested in trying. I couldn't make up my mind, so he brought me samples of three of the more popular items. The jade chicken, the jerk chicken, and carintas. I wouldn't have complained about any of the three. I decided to go with the jerk Chicken and jenred Pork combo. You also get a cookie. I went with a chocolate chip (I'll explain in minute why that was mistake). 

I highly recommend the Jerk Chicken if you like hot food. The heat hits you a second or two after you take your first bite. As you continue to eat, it keeps getting hotter but never overpowering. The Jenred Pork was on par with any Asian restaurant's sweet and Sour pork. The black beans in the combo are wonderfully sweet, but not too sweet. The only thing I was disappointed with was the cookie. The chocolate chip cookie was over-baked and too sugary. My girlfriend had a snickerdoodle with her meal, which she said was the best snickerdoodle she's ever had. I tried a small piece. As usual, she was right.
