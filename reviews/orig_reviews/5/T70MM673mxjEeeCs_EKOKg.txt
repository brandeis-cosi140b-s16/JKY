We love love love Viva Mercado!! We followed Bobby from the location on Jones to the larger location on Rainbow, and were so disappointed when they closed. We have eaten at the new location in Village Square many times and it never disappoints. Food, drinks and service are always spot on. Tonight I had chicken fajitas and my husband had the tilapia...and of course we each had a Sauza Margarita. Everything was delicioso! We've tried many other Mexican restaurants, and every time we ask ourselves why?? Just stick with the best ...Viva Mercado!!
