Wow. Woweeeewow. Fresh, flavorful, fast, reasonably priced. Yes!

Are you that kind of person that doesn't like just one thing on your plate - but likes to sample many things and take a bite of each thing over and over going round the plate til you're done?

ME TOO.

Gadzooks is a dream for you and I! So many inside filling choices, so many topping choices, so many salsa choices... I basically tried everything and it was all amazing, and there are lots of veg friendly options including an outstanding corn bread filling that sounds weird but is so creamy and tasty you'll go nuts. And the tortillas are awesome which is a necessity. 

I pretty much want to order another round and just spend the day here. Don't judge me you'd want to, too, if you were here.
