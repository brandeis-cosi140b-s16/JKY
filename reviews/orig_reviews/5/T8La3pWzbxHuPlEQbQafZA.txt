Oh. My. Love this place. 

My husband ordered the #1 combination plate (hard shell shredded beef taco, cheese enchilada with beans and rice) and I ordered the adovada pork. Both dishes were fantastic!

This establishment is not kidding when it states that they do not do mild. They use a chili from New Mexico that is HOT. Delicious and hot.
