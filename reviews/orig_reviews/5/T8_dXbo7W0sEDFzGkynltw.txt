I love this location. Vibrant, packed with the higher learning population, always busy and like all Mad Mex restaurants the food and beverages are outstanding. 

Mad Mex is one of the few restaurants in the city that can make about 90% of whatever's on the menu and make it vegan or veg. And, if you have other dietary needs like lower fat options, they'll accommodate your needs. That's how we'll they take care of their guests. I love the angry hippy quesadilla, saut√©ed spicy spinach, mushrooms and vegan cheese stuffed in a whole wheat tortilla, grilled nice and crispy, served with the best guacamole in the city and a tasty vegan sour cream. Wash that down with one of many micro brews on tap and you'll be a happy mad mex fan.
