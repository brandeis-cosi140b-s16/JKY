Wow - with a group tonight and everything we tasted and ate was phenomenal.  I had tempered my expectations prior to going but they were blown out of the water.  The chips and salsa were fresh and plentiful - the tomatillo salsa was delicious.  Perhaps it's a health precaution but the temperature of the salsas would benefit from being a tad less chilled but they were still tremendous.  

We all had the carne asada and everyone loved it -- my medium rare was cooked kust right.  They obviously have a nice hot grill because I still had a very nice sear on the outside.  

I also recommend their Micheladas - wow!  I loved mine.  I will definitely be back.
