Just a heads up, don't go here with the expectation that you're getting authentic Mexican food. All of us Zonies know that a really great authentic Mexican restaurant almost always begins with a Mexican woman's name :)

This place is very good for what it is, it's a modern Mexican joint. I like the fish or carne asada tacos. They have lemonade of all sorts, the sour kind that tastes homemade, and oh-so good if you ask me. The creamy rice is my fav (don't look up the ingredients, it will ruin the fun in eating it). The salsa is so-so. 

My bf is not a fan of AZ Mexican food, he is more of a tex-mex kinda guy, and he likes this place -great for me, since it is close by. 

The decor is fun and the employees are perky. It is also low-key place that is easy and you can go as you are.
