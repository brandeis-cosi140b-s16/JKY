A bit of a walk from the Mill Ave. Metro stop, but completely worth it!  One thing for sure...these guys really know how to cook a steak!  Tender, juicy, and the mushroom sauce was seasoned well with just the right thickness.  The cornbread was also delicious, served in a small cast iron skillet (the best way to make it!), cut into serving-size pieces.  And the bits of corn were visible...I love the combination of whole corn with cornmeal.

The queso dip appetizer was tasty, and be slightly careful of the red sauce drizzled on top, as it packs a bit of heat to it, but it went really well with the chips and steak.  If the weather is nice enough, I suggest outdoor seating as it is great for people-watching, almost a must in a college town.  If I ever return to this area of Arizona, I'll definitely be back!
