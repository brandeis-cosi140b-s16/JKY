This place was scrumptious! I cant wait to be back in gilbert so i can experience their super tasty food. The drinks were decent, our whole party of 5 ordered the fresh pressed juice (agua frescas). I ordered the cucumber mint which was different, and kinda dangerous in that I couldn't even taste the vodka that i ordered it with! I would love to try another flavor next visit. The chips were good and salsa was fresh. The food was great! My friend ordered the fish tacos, i ordered the veggie burrito (which was a tad salty, but still very good) and my husband ordered the beef burrito. The portions were VERY generous. We went during happy hour, so 2 drinks and 2 burritos (for my husband and i) came out to $24! Super affordable! Cant wait to come back.
