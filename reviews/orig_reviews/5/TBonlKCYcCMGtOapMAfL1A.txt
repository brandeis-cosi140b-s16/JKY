Ok, so I understand that there are others that don't agree with this rating, but I think this place is amazing!!!!  I have been here several times and their taco's are delicious.  On top of that, they have great appetizers and margaritas.  Hit this place up during happy hour and try the guac and ceviche.   Let's not forget the best item at Cien Agave which is their habanero margarita.  Absolutely amazing!!!
