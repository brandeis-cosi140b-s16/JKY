Basically anything you order is going to be your favorite! Don't be too sketched out by the area; it adds to the authenticity! I would recommend the chicken chimi or a basic bean and cheese burrito. Awards cover the walls of this place and you know it's good! Be sure to grab a dozen tortillas to go or some salsa by the pint.
