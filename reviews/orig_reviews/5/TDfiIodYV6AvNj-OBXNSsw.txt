Currently sitting here w/ a quarter of my enchilada style burrito left, ridiculously full & highly satisfied, yet still tempted to finish what I have because it just taste too damn good.

But I really want dessert so I think I'll hold off on hating myself later on. Lol **update: I finished it hahaha.

First of all, the complimentary fried tortillas and homemade salsa they bring out before your food comes are delicious. The tortillas are warm & crisp to perfection. I really like chunks of tomato & chopped vegetables & herbs. 

The fiesta plate was a yummy foreshadow to how great the rest of the food was going to be. I was pretty much full after it (although it was only split between my guy & me). But once the enchilada style burrito came out, I regained my appetite. The sides enhanced the main dish perfectly. The meat inside was full of flavor & tasted liked it was charred bbq'd and aghh. Everything was just so good. Highly recommend it!
