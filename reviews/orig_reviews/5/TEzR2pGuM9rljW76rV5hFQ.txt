Oh man, the burgers here are better than In-and-Out. They must cook the meat patties in extra doses of love or something because it didn't take me long at all to wolf down mine.

I ordered the guacamole burger with everything on it, along with their seasoned steak fries. Typical fries, delicious burger. I also ordered the Caesar salad, which was the usual fare. The lettuce was super fresh and crisp, which won me over. The plate wasn't drowned in dressing, either,  which was a relief. 

My aunt ordered the beef mix, which came with tortillas, rice and beans. These beans had substance! I was very pleased to see that they were the perfect balance of solids and liquids. They weren't soup; nor were they a paste. The beef was very Hispanic in its flavors: spicy, salty, aromatic. 

I recommend this place wholeheartedly if you find yourself in the neighborhood.
