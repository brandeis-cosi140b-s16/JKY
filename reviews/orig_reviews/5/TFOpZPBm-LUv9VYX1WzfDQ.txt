This is one of our favorite places to eat in Charlotte. My BF LOVES (yes...an all CAPS kind of feeling) the Pacos Taco. I usually switch it up and try something different all the time. I've never had anything I didn't like. 
One thing I get every time is the El Dorado Margarita on the rocks...I'm not a huge Margarita fan, but this one is tasty!!
The service is usually pretty awesome...the chips/salsa are fresh and we have a hard time not filling up on those and the queso (white cheese) that we always order. 
We are definite fans of this place and go at least 3 times a month.
