So the story goes the building use to be a Methodist Church and then it was a Korean Church for a few years and now it is a ridiculously good resturant. All of the food is freshly made from local farms and is delicious. The tacos are amazing and the beef is the best!  Great service and very cool atmosphere. If you have room left get the coconut pie you will not be disappointed!!!
