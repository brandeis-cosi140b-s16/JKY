My girlfriends and I go to Scottsdale twice a year to escape the cold of Seattle, and The Mission is hands down our favorite restaurant.  The service is always fantastic, the food is out of this world, and the atmosphere is unfailingly fun.  Brian, one of the owners, remembers us each time we visit and treats us like regulars, even though we're only there twice a year.  Truly an outstanding place to eat!
