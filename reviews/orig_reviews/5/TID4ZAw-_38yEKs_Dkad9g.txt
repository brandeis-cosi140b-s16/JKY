Ok... So I just finished tacos from Jalisco for the umpteenth time and here's the thing... If I was on death row ( which I hope doesn't happen anytime soon...) 2 fish tacos and 2 carnitas tacos plus a bunch of other stuff I didn't order cuz ok... I'm NOT on death row... Would b my last meal!!! Must I say it again?!? If u haven't been here yet... What the HELL is wrong w/ u?????
