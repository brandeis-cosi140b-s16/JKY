I knew about, but hadn't tried the new Decatur location.  I knew all was well when the owner came out and said "Welcome back--we haven't seen you in almost 6 months."

I went with the Bulgogi burrito and my son had the beef burrito.  excellent as usual.  What more is there to say other than that we will be back to try more of the fusion items....
