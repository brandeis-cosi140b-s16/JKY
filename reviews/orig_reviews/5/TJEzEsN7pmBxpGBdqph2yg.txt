Let me tell you, this place is the BOMB! This location was the first Braddah I've ever had. We had the bowl of kalua pig and steak. It was the best choice I could ever chose. When we first came in, they helped us choose what to eat and gave us sample. The staffs were super helpful and they greeted us the moment we walked. The food was a large portion. I shared one with my girl and it filled both of us. We had the coconut bark for dessert and it was so unique. Definitely recommend to anyone who's into Chipotle. Try this instead of Chipotle next door.
