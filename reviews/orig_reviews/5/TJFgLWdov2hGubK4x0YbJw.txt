Amazing!!! Reminds me of my time living in Tijuana. Traditional street tacos :) 

This is not a run in and out, fast food restaurant - expect to wait 1/2 hour or more to even place your order. Well worth the wait! 

Food is EXCELLENT!!! For those who have never experienced something like this is strongly recommend the adobada tacos - super flavorful. I have never met a person who did not like them :)
