These $1.29 tacos of love are a must try.  They have a variety of options such as asada bulgogi and pastor(pork).  I tried the bulgogi and pastor which both were devoured within 2 min.  We also ordered the wings and fries and trust me, they dont not give you those skimpy little buffalo wild wings or wingstop peices of crap.  These wings here aren't massive but the perfect size and fried to sexellent perfection.  I don't know why but something about good chicken wings always turns me on kekeke

CUSTOMER SERVICE IS GREAT HERE. BEST SERVICE EVERRRR
