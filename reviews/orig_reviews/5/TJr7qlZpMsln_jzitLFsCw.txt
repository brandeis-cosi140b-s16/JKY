Komex was amazing. I went with my family and bf and we all ordered different things. We got the Kim chee fried rice, Mongolian beef, bulgogi fries and fusion burrito. All of which were amazing, the best Mongolian beef ever. The bulgogi fries was so amazing that we came back the next day only to find out that they are closed on mondays. Try this place!!!!!
