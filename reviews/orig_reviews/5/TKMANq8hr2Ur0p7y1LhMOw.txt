Stopped in after getting a recommendation from a friend and wow!  The tacos were outstanding!!!  I tried the Pollo, Carnitas, Asada and Pastor tacos...and then I went back and ordered another Asada and Pastor!  The Asada is the prefect amount of flavor with spice!!  The Pastor has some added sauce that makes it all come together in your mouth perfectly! 

I will be back and probably on Taco Tuesday when these baby's are only $1!!
