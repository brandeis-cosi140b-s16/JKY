I honestly have no idea how the food is at the Blind Pig - but the butcher shop inside, Hobe Meats, is awesome. I had a groupon for $40 worth of meat and was helped by Quinn. In this day in age Im not accustomed to dealing with someone who is friendly, helpful, amusing, courteous and seems to truly enjoy their job. Quinn was all of these. He helped me pick out the cuts of meat and even explained how they should be seasoned and grilled. I left the shop feeling like I had left another dimension - one where customer service still mattered. 
Oh, and because of my wonderful experience, I now have plans to check out the actual restaurant - lol. Hopefully they match up
