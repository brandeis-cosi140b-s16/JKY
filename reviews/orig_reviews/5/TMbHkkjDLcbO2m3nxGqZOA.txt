This place was fantastic! A friend and I were in town for a conference and tired of the strip. We checked online for the best mexican food, and found this place. From the strip, it was about a 15 minute drive, but sooooo worth it!!!

Well, to start off with, they bring out yummy chips, salsa, and beans. We ordered aguas de Jamaica and it was delish! Our glasses were constantly refilled, and we felt attended to. 

I couldn't decide on the plethora of choices, but finally decided on the fish tacos, which were fabulous. Nice homeade corn tortillas and a generous portion of crunchy fish pieces, and thick slices of avocado.They came with a delicious sauce on the side, and also the lettuce came on the side of the plate, so it was nice to add however much I wanted of each.

My buddy was also indecisive, but by suggestion of the waiter ordered the Pollo Sarandeado, and she absolutely loved the flavoring. She had previously lived in Mexico and missed the authentic food, but this food really did it for her. She also commented it was probably the best chicken she ever had!

To finish off the meal, we had sopapillas. Deeeelicious!
