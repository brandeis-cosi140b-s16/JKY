My husband and I always try to have date lunch. So we decided to try somewhere new. This is our first time at Juan flaming fajitas and it was AMAZING!!!
The fajitas are literally flaming on your table. One thing I love was the option of having grilled veggies instead of rice and beans and romain lettuce wraps instead of tortillas, that's is a very clever idea. Excellent service!!! For sure we are  coming back.
