After leaving Sack's Cafe at 3:30 (23rd ave & Camelback), I have just enough time to skate over the extra five blocks to Two Hippies Beach House before I have to be to my other place of employment, Practical Art near Central & Camelback.  I ate at THBH two days ago and I've been plotting how many times I can make this excursion each week since. It's SO good.

Managing the cafe, I've learned a lot about food cost margins, and I saw another Yelper mention this in relation to THBH's pricing ($2 loaded tacos!).  And YES, we all need to eat here en masse and buy in BULK so this place can stay profitable enough to feed me!  And why shouldn't we?? This place has delicious food-- all muy fresca! 

I ordered two tacos, a Cactus Taco and their daily special-- Artichoke & Black Bean.  For some reason, I half expected them to be in corn tortillas, but I wasn't disappointed when I realized that they actually came in 6" flour tortillas.  These things were stuffed to the gills, so they were a bit messy-- but I managed to very diligently get most of the food into my mouth.  I can accomplish a lot when I'm focused.  I ordered a blackberry lemonade to accompany my tacos, which was sweet, but tasty.  I think this is a great 'schtick' for the Beach House-- lemonade in something like a dozen flavors.  These folks are right on point thematically with everything they've put together here-- I've seen a few places go under for trying to encompass too many modalities.  

To tie a bow on it, FINALLY a place that proves buying local and healthy doesn't mean breaking the bank.  Heart these hippies.
