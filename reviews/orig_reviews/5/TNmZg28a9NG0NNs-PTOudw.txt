This is my FAVORITE taco shop! Every salsa is unique and delicious. Margaritas are some of the best I've ever had out - not too sweet, yummy citrus pulp for flavor. Amazing horchata. Beautiful artwork. Kind of small inside so you may have to come at a slightly odd hour to be sure you get a seat. Oh! I almost forgot about the guacamole! Very fresh and very tasty!
