Came here for the girlfriends birthday dinner. The service was great, two thumbs up. I had the quesadilla and she had a believe the combo plate. We've have been to the Javier's in Newport Beach and loved the decor there so when we came to vegas for a small weekend relaxing vacation we knew we had to try this place out. Loved the skull wall artwork. It reminded me of pirates of the Caribbean or something like that. I eat Mexican food about 3 or 4 times out of the week since I'm Mexican. From Jalisco so I know what's good authentic Mexican food, and this place is good Mexican food nothing far left of what your mom would cook.  Reasonable price def worth checking out for some good Mexican food in the strip.
