Foods recommended....tejas trio, catfish tacos, smothered chicken burrito an more. My wife and I come here often and love the food. The margaritas are real good, but real strong. 

Only downside is the patio. Good people watching, but it's in basically a parking garage. 

All in all you can't go wrong here.
