The food here is great and the Margarita's with good Tequila's are good.
The Happy Hour is great. (Where else can you get Patron half-off?)

Being from Europe, Mexican food does not impress me but this is Southern Mexico (Mayan) cuisine with heavy use of Achiote paste.

The style of cooking is also fantastic. Carne Asada Rib-Eye with Fingerling potatoes? How much smarter can you get when it comes to food? Asada tenderized (Asada is a Mexican style of tenderizing meat, for non foodies) fatty beef cut with potatoes that have sweet skin. Absolutely delicious.
