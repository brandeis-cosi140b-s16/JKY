I absolutely love this place. I have had the carne asada, lingua, fish, chorizo, al pastor and horchata and all are phenomenal. To top it off the owner is really nice and makes sure everyone is happy. There is a reason this guy has been in the last three issues of Phoenix magazine. Go there now, you won't regret it!
