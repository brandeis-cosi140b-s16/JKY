This review is for the Chips and Salsa:  I go to Cantina Laredo strictly for the chips, salsa, and guacamole so I can't review anything else on the menu.  The table side guacamole gets a 10/10.  I love the atmosphere and decor inside the restaurant.  Very clean and friendly.  They have a cute outdoor patio if you are looking for a nice spot to visit with friends.  To-go orders are always neatly packaged.
