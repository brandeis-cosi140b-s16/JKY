Favorite burrito place in Vegas.  Anything you order is delicious. Breakfast burritos are bomb. Owner and staff are friendly. It's a small place but it's seems like everyone in the restaurant,(patrons and staff), are friendly and happy. You can only find such an ambiance in restaurants that serve excellent food.
