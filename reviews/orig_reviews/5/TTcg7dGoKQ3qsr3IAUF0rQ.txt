YUM!

Went here with some sorority sisters after an afternoon of volunteering. I am fairly certain it's a newer place and just had its grand opening a few weeks ago. I ordered a salad with came in the soft tortilla shell. I got the chicken, lettuce, gacumole, pico, tomato, cheese, and a wonderful creamy chiptole dressing.
I devoured it. It was so delish. The best part about ordering at the place to is that they will sing to you if you order nachos. I couldn't make out what they were saying 100% but it was entertaining. They also have a really festive array of drinks. Your typical soda machine of course, but off to the side is about 4 cooler of fun mixes. There's mint lemonade, Mexican limeade, and 2 others. All made in house and totally authentic. 

They are making their claim to fame with the torillas though. I would recommend this place to just go and eat their bread all day.
