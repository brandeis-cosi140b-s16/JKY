The reason I love Padre's is it's the perfect combo of casual, relaxed and DELICIOUS.   Great prices, cold beer, great selection of margaritas and other drinkie-poos, and yummy food to go with the drinking.   I think the servers and bartenders here are all very nice, outgoing and friendly.   And they have a great sense of humor too - Example: as a single person, I hate Valentine's Day.  - every other restaurant in town trys to bring in the "couples" with all their hearts and flowers b.s..... but Padre's had a hilarious party where they played only "broken heart" and "he cheated on me and now I'm going to kill him" songs....  too funny.    Love it there.
