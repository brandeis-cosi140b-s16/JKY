Little known watering hole, becoming the spot to get a cold beer and enjoy a great meal.  The kitchen is behind the bar, the atmosphere is unique and origional as any good hideaway should be.  The place has always been packed but people have always been coming and going so there's never been a wait.  Unless you get enough people to reserve the back dinning room I would only suggest 2-4 people as seating can be difficult.
