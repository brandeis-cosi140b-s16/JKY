I love Gadzooks! I'm very critical of new restaurants and this place is impressive. Clever idea to go to market with enchiladas and soups. What impressed me the most....wood burning oven, high quality meats, options, and quick order to pick up time. Open and clean design inside. I highly recommend this place for brunch, lunch of dinner.
