Been here tons of times...just realized I never mentioned the Adobada Fries before!

Ask for a small portion because they are still huge and are plenty big enough to share!

$5 is the entry price.  Adobada/Al Pastor is the best thing ever in case you didn't know already!  Slightly spicy marinated pork with all the goodies!  

You'll never want to eat carne asada again lol
