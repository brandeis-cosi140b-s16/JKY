I felt like I was actually in Mexico when I ate here.  The restaurant is not located in the best part of town which may deter some people but once you're inside, you forget about the exterior.  When you walk in, there is a bar stocked full of different tequila, and luchador paintings hang on the wall.  Local art is displayed throughout the rest of the restaurant and is available for purchase.  The food is not your typical rice and tacos.  It has an interesting twist.  I ordered the "pollo poblano".  It was some of the best chicken I have ever had.  The food is a little pricey (around $20-$25 an entree) but it is definitely worth at least one visit.  

Also, do not forget to take a trip to the bathroom! It's pretty interesting...
