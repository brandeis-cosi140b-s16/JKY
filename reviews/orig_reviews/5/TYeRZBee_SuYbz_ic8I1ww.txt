We just moved to the area and have been in search of some good Mexican food...and we found it today!!!!  Everything was delicious...from the homemade chips and salsa (mild and hot), to the guacamole, the huge margaritas, the fajita meats, EVERYTHING!  They have both indoor and patio dining too!  One of the very best parts was our server, Angel!  He was attentive, had great suggestions, very funny, and even reminded us to come back for happy hour!!!  We will absolutely be dining here a lot!!!
