Juan's flaming fajitas is a good option if you're on the western part of the Las Vegas Valley and don't want to go to Lindo Michoacan I would put juan's flaming fajitas right up there with the earlier places.  As some of you may know it is run by people that were affiliated with viva mercado.  There were two previous locations that went out of business viva Mercado in both of its locations, Jones and flamingo and then rainbow in the Walmart shopping center

When you arrive at the restaurant you'll be seated quickly the options that you have ate booths or tables and you'll get fast service with chips beans and salsa including peppers and onions roasted, from there you'll have your order taken quickly.  and then the food will come out quickly.  They have an extensive menu there are a number of options in terms of combo platters and Ã  la cart selections, tacos rolled tacos soft or hard Shell .   We've gone to juans flaming fajitas a number of times and each time it's consistent there's never an Off Time here 

Probably one of the best parts of this restaurant would be that consistent service, the waiters are very professional and even the bussers do a good job of cleaning things up quickly and bringing you refills and extras as you need them without being overbearing and that's pretty hard to do.  
I like the price, it's not expensive and you can take a family there of five people and get a good deal.
