This has to be the best Mexican restaurant in Phoenix.  A friend told me to try it and I was not disappointed.  The enchiladas verdes are amazing.  The chicken inside was soft and tender.  The decor and ambiance was very nice too.  I would highly recommend this place to anyone who enjoys good Mexican food.
