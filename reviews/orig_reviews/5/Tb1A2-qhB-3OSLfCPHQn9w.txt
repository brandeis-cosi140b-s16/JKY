I came here for brunch with a group of friends and I can't wait to come back! On Sundays they have bottomless mimosas, bloody marys, and micheladas for $15. I go the mimosa--you can mix and match flavors like guava, pineapple, blood orange, and mango. We ordered a bunch of stuff so we could try a variety. Dishes not to be missed: the bacon guacamole, the short rib benedict, and the green tea waffles with duck. I will be back soon! Service from LeeAnn was great!
