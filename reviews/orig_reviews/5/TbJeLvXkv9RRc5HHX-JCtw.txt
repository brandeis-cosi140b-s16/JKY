Nach Daddy = Delicious! ... Its been really hard finding a good Mexican food joint here in Vegas... Finally found what I've been missing since moving from home!!!

Not only is everything fresh, the seasonings and spices are done perfectly... They have a great selection of margaritas (I love the peach, YUMMM!), the nachos rocked and the enchilada plate was sooooo good! Service was awesome, the waitress was on point and so sweet!

Really great eat, I will definitely be back soon!!!!
