Had dinner here last night. Seated quickly. Loves the relaxed atmosphere that was evident throughout the restaurant. 
Ordered 3 tacos and 2 Victorias. Each of the tacos were the size of the street tacos I get in LA, not small like others believe. The meat and condiments were tasty,hot and FRESH! Service was on point. 

My only negative was that they didn't have XL shirts. I figure it's just another reason to return for more tacos.
