My co-worker walked in from lunch the other day with their horchata and I liked the bit I had so much I demanded to know where it was from. It took a bit for me to get used to the sheer number of salsas they had available, but once I got comfortable trying things (I was afraid I might burn my tongue off accidentally) I was hooked! 

I'd recommend the peanut salsa to anyone. It was some seriously good sauce.
