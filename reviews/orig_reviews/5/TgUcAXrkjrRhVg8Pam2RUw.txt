Please look past the crap strip mall, the speaker outside on a chair and get inside and EAT! Everything I have ordered has been incredible....had the Camaron De Ojo today and it was bananas. Atmosphere is whatever, wouldn't recommend it for a first date...gotta have a down to earth girl for this one! Its all about the food!!
