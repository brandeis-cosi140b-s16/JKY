You can't beat Taco Tuesday's at Cien Agaves! My family and friends have made it a weekly ritual and we can hardly go the entire week without craving those crunchy, beef tacos! At $1 each, I order two, with a side of black or refried beans and I'm all set. They serve complimentary chips with two salsas--tomato fresca and spicy tomatillo (my personal favorite). Last night we tried the Street Corn for the first time. It comes topped with a smokey chili blend, crumbled cotija cheese and with the full-husk to use as a handle. It's just a bit spicy, full of flavor and highly recommended (and just fun to eat)! There are also $2 Tecates so you can have a few with your meal and still come out paying only about 10 bucks. Really?? The restaurant is always hoppin' with happy people of all ages. It's well worth the trip, and maybe it will become a Tuesday ritual of yours too!
