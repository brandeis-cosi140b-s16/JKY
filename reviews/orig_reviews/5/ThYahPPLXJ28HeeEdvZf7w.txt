Everything about this place is great! The ambiance, the margaritas, and definitely the food. It's always hard to decide, but I've never been let down. Tableside guacamole is Amazingly fresh and you're never ignored by the busser or server, there's always someone to give you more chips...which disappear quickly. This is also a great place to go for a birthday because who doesn't like a sombrero and tequila shot for their birthday!!!
