The Best of Phoenix issue did not disappoint me or my daughter.  I got a delicious combination of spiciness.  The complimentary chips come with a variety of dips - salsa, bean dip, and some kind of creamy goodness.  The daughter was a little skeptical of all three options, so more for me.  I see other reviews referring to four dips, so maybe I was drunk off of over eating.  At the end, they give you a sapodilla to ensure that your belly is full and round.  The daughter was happy about that and I had to roll myself back to the car.
