El Zocalo's consistently serves up great food, great atmosphere and great service!

Some of the best salsa and margartia's around and you can't beat the wonderful patio for either a group outing or a romantic dinner.

The music on the weekends adds to the appeal.  I am a regular and never tire of this wonderful restaurant.
