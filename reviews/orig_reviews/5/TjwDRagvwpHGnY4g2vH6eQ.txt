In the mood for Mexican and in old town shopping around, why not try Barrio Queen!? This place wasn't very busy on a Saturday early afternoon which was really nice! Its a cute little Mexican Food place, gives off the normal ambiance, but what makes it a little cooler and catches your eye when your walking by, is their large patio area. They have a few outside tables along the side of their building and a larger covered area out back. Set up perfect for the weather we have been having lately. As soon as we stepped inside, everyone was very kind and helpful, this was our first visit, so they told us a little about the restaurant, the menu and their drinks.

We stopped by for just a small quick bite, so we order 3 small tacos, the carnitas, Al Pastor and the Carne Asada and oddly some mimosa's to go with them! Who said you can't have tacos and mimosas for brunch!?? LOL! Our waiter was very nice, informative, and attentive and actually made our morning better with how friendly and smiley he was. They always say if you smile at someone, it rubs off! It definitely did and he really helped make our morning! I feel awful for not remembering his name  The tacos were small which we knew going in, so if you are hungry I would order a few, but they were definitely delicious! The meat all tasted good, the onion and cilantro was all fresh, tortillas were fresh and warm! Great tacos!

Wonderful food, wonderful staff, cool place, had a great time!
