This is another bargain buy for the economically challenged.  For less than a value meal at the Jack in the Box that burnt down across the street, you can get a beef bulgolgi burrito, filled with beef, veggies, rice, etc, etc, etc and chips+salsa.  Seriously, I'm not a fat man, but I can pack away some comida.  You won't be disappointed.

One thing that I loved was that the owners work the kitchen and are very nice and pleasant.  Some high school kid came in and asked to interview the owner for a research paper when I was there the other day.  The lady had no problems sitting down with the student to talk about the restaurant.  I thought that was really classy.

All in all, this place boasts prices from the 1980's and enough food per serving to give anyone a lovely food baby.  I've made it a normal weekly eatery of mine.
