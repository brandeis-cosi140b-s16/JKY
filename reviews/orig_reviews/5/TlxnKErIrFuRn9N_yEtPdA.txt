First off, I would like to give a shout out to my server, Winter. She did an awesome job!!! She was on top of everything. She made great suggestions. I always had a full drink. Also, there was never a long wait in between courses. 

Everything I had was very tasty. 

- Cornbread - It wasn't the best I have ever had. I usually lean towards a sweeter cornbread, but it was still really good with the butter. 
- Grilled Jumbo Quesadilla with Cilantro Pesto Grilled Shrimp - I loved the crunchiness of the tortilla and size of the shrimp in every bite. 
- Southwestern Caesar Salad - My favorite part of this salad was the spicy kick to it. 
- Grilled Miso Salmon - I think 3 different workers told me this was their favorite entree here. Every bite was heavenly. The miso sauce was sweet and compliments the medium rare salmon. Even the potato cake and vegetables that it came with were perfect and unique. 
- Ancho Fudge Pie with Ice Cream - At first I was skeptical to try this dessert because it contained ancho chile, but it really intensified the chocolate flavor. I don't think I've ever had chocolate like this before. 

Since I had an amazing experience, I'm afraid if I ever have Z'Tejas again and order anything, but the items above, I'll be disappointed. I suggest to anyone to give Z'Tejas a try, but you have to at least order the Grilled Miso Salmon.
