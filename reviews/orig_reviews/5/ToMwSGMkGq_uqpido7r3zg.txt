Needing seafood, we decided to look up agauchiles on yelp. We came across a little spot off the strip and decided to give it a try. We were very pleased with customer service and of course the food was phenomenal. You must try the shrimp empanadas! Great after a long night of drinking. Another plate that was very tasty was the mojara a la diabla. Great taste and very filling. Oh and let's not forget about the aguachiles they were excellent! So if you're in Vegas come give this place a try!
