Wow! We pulled up to this place with some skepticism, but after entering we  immediately knew we were in for a great lunch. With a salsa bar in the corner, we were given chips and first tried 3 different salsas. We ordered two types of tacos and a chicken mole quesadilla to share. The tacos were good, and the quesadilla was like a fluffy fried calzone. Absolutely delicious! The only bump was the fact I ordered my taco with no mushrooms and it came with them, but I didn't mind that much. 

My husband had a hornitos margarita which was good as well. Next time we're in Phoenix we will certainly be back!
