Fabulous food for those going from the sublime (Encore by Wynn across the street) to the local and not ridiculous. Very serious taco lovers only.  No new age veggie or chicken; the quesadilla de lengua (tongue) is specialty.  We loved sopa de chorizo b/c the mamasita is making fresh corn sopas as you watch. Fresh. Delicious. Satisfaction guaranteed.
