Wow, I can't stop going to this place!  I have to get on here and comment on a couple of new menu items I've tried.  Recently tried the Adobada and the Carnitas burritos - both were fantastic.  Pork and guacamole is always a great combo.  And the Steak and Chorizo Burrito is the stuff of legends.  No joke - this thing is amazing!  It's pretty much all meat with a red chile-type sauce.
