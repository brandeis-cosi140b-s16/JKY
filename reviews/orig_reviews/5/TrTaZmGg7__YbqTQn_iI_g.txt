Brandon was a perfect server, he was quick and attentive. The food is wonderful! Cheese dip portion was huge and black bean dip was same size. Plenty of food - large portions. Great drinks. There is a TWO TOP TABLE THAT HAS A OUTLET TO CHARGE YOUR PHONE. It's right around the corner on the wall. I love to be able to charge my phone while dining! Superb service!!
