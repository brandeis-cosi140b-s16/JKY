Very yummy. If you aren't open minded about trying different yet authentic mexican food, this place ain't the place for you. Taco Bell is always down the street for you. Otherwise, the tacos are delicious. They are street tacos. (Ever been to Tacos El Gordo? Yeah their tacos are like that but way fresher and more flavor.) I got the tacos al pastor and lengua which was delicious. They had a cool salsa bar with of course, fresh mild to spicy salsa. I had a drink of their horchata which was also delicious. The only downfall is that I live all the way in Mountain's Edge and it is quite a drive to get here, but it is worth it. I will come back for more!
