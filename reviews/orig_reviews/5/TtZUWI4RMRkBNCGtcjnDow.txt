Best tortillas ever. I'm from California and my boyfriend took me here because it's his favorite Mexican place. The tortilla is phenomenal and thin but also has flavor to it.  I'm not the biggest tortilla fan but this one I ate all of it haha

I got a red machaca and it was really juicy and delicious.  I haven't had better tasting/juicer meat in California.  It's also really cheap.

Try the butter tortilla but stay away from the horchata.
