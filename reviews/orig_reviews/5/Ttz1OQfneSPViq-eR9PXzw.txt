I have had a lot of Mexican food over the years, some good and some not so good. The Joyride ranks up there with some of the best. Having had the 3 taco combo I choose the "Standard, Baja Fish & Pork." While the Standard and Baja were out of this world the pork was just ok, not my fav at this time. Will need to try it again. The deserts, while only 3 choices available, we choose 2 of the 3 and they were an "oral orgasm." The service exceptional, the ambiance trey KOOL and the food the BEST! I'll be BACK!! ;~)}
