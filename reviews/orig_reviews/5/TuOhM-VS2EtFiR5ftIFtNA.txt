Yummy!  Richie and Helen are cooking up fantastic authentic Mexican food with flavor and love!  I've been so sick of those, "We don't love you, food chain restaurants, ie: Chipolte, ect..."  I googled, "Best authentic Mexican food in Surprise, AZ," and found some great reviews for Rito's.  I went there today and had the green chili burrito, enchilada style with a side of beans and rice.  Yummylicious!   It was good, "mom loves you," food.  And don't be a bitch because they charge separately for a side of rice and beans--I work in a restaurant and I see all you carb haters not eating your rice and bean.  The rice and beans are both made from scratch and well worth paying the extra dollar for.  You will love this food.  And don't forget to say thank you to Helen and Richie.
