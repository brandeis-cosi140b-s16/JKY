Nacho Daddy has become our favorite local restaurant.  The service is always great and the food is excellent.  We've enjoyed a variety of the dishes they offer.  My favorites are the BBQ baby back ribs which literally fall off the bone, the grilled buffalo chicken flat bread, and the grilled fish tacos.  They have increased their variety of beers on tap and now offer Old Rasputin which has become my favorite since I enjoy dark, chocolaty beer.  And my wife enjoys the fuego chicken and the Cuban sandwich.  She also loves the house margarita which they have perfected.  I've recommended Nacho Daddy to many neighbors and friends and they are glad I did.
