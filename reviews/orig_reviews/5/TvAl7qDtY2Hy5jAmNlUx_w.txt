My father and I ate at Täko on Friday night around 10 PM. We just got into Pittsburgh after a long 12 hour Amtrak journey from Boston and decided to grab something to eat near our hotel. We came upon Täko and were instantly intrigued by the outdoor seating that looked into the kitchen. We waited outside for a few minutes then realized you are supposed to go in and put your name on the waiting list. We spoke to the hostess, who was very nice,and she seated us immediately at the outside counter. 

Damien, our waiter, was awesome from the get go. He recommend the Tako taco (grilled octopus) as well as a guacamole blend and a few drinks. In addition to the tako I ordered the Korean taco. The Oaxaca Old fashion was a great Mexican spin on a traditional old fashion and Damien gave us a little background history about how that drink tied into the whiskey rebellion. The tuna guacamole was the perfect fusion of Japanese and Mexican flavors. The umami flavors really came through and they were not scant on the amount of the fish they included in it. 

The entrees were also delicious. I highly recommend the grilled octopus taco. The fresh lemon juice and the peanut sauce made for a refreshing and savory coalescence of flavors. The octopus was very tender and the portions were generous. The Korean taco had a good amount of spice it blended the flavors very well. For dessert we had the whipped cheese cake, which was a modern deconstructed version a traditional cheese cake. It spiraled up around a center of blueberries blackberries and raspberries. They topped it off with a creamy vanilla ice cream that stole the show. All of Damien's recommendations were successes. This restaurant is a must for anyone in the area-great food and staff.
