Amazingly good Mexican food for the price. The atmosphere is cafe style with a comfortable feel - much nicer than most of the taco shops around town. 

The salsa they give you with the complimentary chips is amazing! The taco and tostada were perfect, the rice and beans dead on.

A great lunch destination in south Tempe.
