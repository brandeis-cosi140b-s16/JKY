Been here a few more times. Ordered a couple different burritos - which were good but a little expensive for a burrito.  Better to do the lunch menu or get the combination 3 item plate.  The staff, however, is still awesome.  Very few places have I been where the service is excellent all the time.  Before you even ask for something, they bring it.  Thanks Viva Mercado, so glad you're back in business.
