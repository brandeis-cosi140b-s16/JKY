I cannot say enough great things about the food and the service here. From the moment my wife and I stepped in the manager Betty and our server Julian made us feel at home. Julian was attentive, kind and knowledgable. Betty made us feel like family. I have not encountered a manager of this level at a strip restaurant and I have been to most of them!
