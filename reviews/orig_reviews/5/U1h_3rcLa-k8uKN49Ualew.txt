YUM! So far this is the best restaurant I've been to in Phoenix. The service was fantastic.  They made us feel like we were visiting their house for Sunday dinner.  The guacamole with pomegranate was extremely tasty and the fresh tortilla chips were some of the best I've had.  For entrees, I was between the shrimp or the fish tacos and asked the server for his advise.  He told me he'd suprise me.  Love it! I ended up with the fish tacos and they were some of the best fish tacos I've ever had.  Coming from San Diego, that's a pretty big feat.  My husband had the chili relleno with shrimp and scallops and it was soooo tastey! I really wish we would have saved room for dessert.  The flan or the churros looked unbelievable.  Next time!

I hardly ever give 5 stars so check this place out!
