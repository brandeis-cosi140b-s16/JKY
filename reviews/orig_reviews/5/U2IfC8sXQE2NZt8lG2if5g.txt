Love, love, love.

Recently stumbled into this place after a day walking around the farmers market and downtown Scottsdale.  The atmosphere is amazing, kindof an industrial/old world Spanish feel (think Santa Fe Loft).  And they have a great serving staff--speedy, friendly and knowledgeably.  When I first sat down, I was a little put off by the prices.  I had brought my whole family along and didn't intended on quite the spendy dinner.  However, all the selections looked and tasted so wonderful!  By the end of the night I had ordered dinner entrees, drinks AND dessert.  The kids still won't stop talking about their fried bananas :)  I definitely plan to revisit, when I have more time and cash to enjoy fully.
