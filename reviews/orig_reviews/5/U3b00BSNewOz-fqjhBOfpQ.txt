Amazing!!!   Finally got in to check this place out!  The service was phenomenal (Server-Elizabeth), the ambiance is unparalleled especially for a Mexican restaurant, and the food was awesome!  Be sure to try the "De La Tierra" for the table!   It's enough for 3-4 ppl or two very hungry people.  For drinks, try "The Office!"
