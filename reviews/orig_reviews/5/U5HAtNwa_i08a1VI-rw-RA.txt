This place is a bit on the pricey side, but during their happy hour it's at least a little more affordable. Their fried avocado tacos are freaking delicious!! Their chips and salsa and nachos are pretty good too. I also enjoy their margaritas and redbull vodka slushies. But definitely go during happy hour if you want some better deals
