My first ever yelp review and it has to go to Huaraches Moroleon! I love this place so much! Not only my favorite Mexican spot, but one of my top 5 favorite Urbana restaurants.
-Staff is friendly and accommodating
-The chips are so fresh and crispy and delicious
-They have a separate VEGETARIAN MENU!!! I've been to lots of Mexican restaurants and have never seen that. It has some delicious unique options like CACTUS fajitas and a nice fresh salad with pineapple chunks, cactus, veggies, pico de gallo, and beans
-I always skip the cheese and sour cream to make stuff VEGAN and let me tell you, with all of the fresh flavors, I don't miss the dairy at all!
-The sauces! Oh my, they bring out 3 bottles of house-made sauces to the table with the chips, and those sauces.....the green is my favorite and the smoky red comes in a close second!!!
-The guacamole is fresh and just as yummy as guac can be
-Also it's always an awesome value
-Did I mention they have a full breakfast menu too??!
-I could go on and on but I will stop now. Can't wait til my next visit!
