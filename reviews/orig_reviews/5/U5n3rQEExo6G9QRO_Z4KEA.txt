Another solid meal in the books!  Hands down, my top 3 restaurants in the Valley.  Recently I took my boss to this place, he's from the Mid-west and hasn't had any true Mexican food.  He was thoroughly impressed with this place.  We started our meals with fresh oysters, which were amazing, followed by the complimentary ceviche.  It was delicious and had a fresh crispy taste to it  My boss went with the fish tacos, which he really enjoyed and loved, while I stuck with my good to meal.  The Molcajete, which is a fried fish.  It's probably my favorite dish that they have there.  It comes with corn tortillas, beans and rice.  Everything was on point and the food was outstanding.

They have great ambiance in the restaurant and the service was impeccable.  For all my yelpers, please give this place a try.  You'll be glad you did.  For an authentic seafood Mexican meal, this is your spot!
