I am in love. First of all, I'm a taco connoisseur & a tequila lover, so it wouldn't have taken much to please me. However, the corona & lime chicken tacos were excellent, our server was knowledgeable about tequilas (& able to find something for my hyper-picky best friend to eat), & the margaritas were good enough that my generally thrifty friends ordered 3 each.

I agree that it would be helpful to have some sort of primer on tequila for those who are less tequila-inclined, but I will definitely be back.
