Wow this place is AMAZING...after driving by this place an friend saying we need to try it we finally did. Needless to stay the food an service impeccable. We both had chicken fajitas an they were great. I love the fact they bring them out on these cool pod looking skillets is the only way to describe it still sizzling an then they set them on fire. It's so cool. I love the way they stay warm while the fire underneath keeps them a cooking. I would def. recommend this place to everyone. The food Great...the service great.
