I had the pleasure of spending the better part of an evening at the Cabo Wabo Cantina.  The bartender, waiters and support staff were very friendly.  I ate inside at the bar and the bartender, Nikki, made me a Waborita.  What was special about that, was that it wasn't on the drink menu.  Luckily I was wearing a shirt with the ingredients/recipe on the back.  It was fantastic.  I ordered the split Ceviche and although it looked like small portions, It actually filled me up.  A group of English tourists came in and asked about the Waborita and soon the were drinking them too.  I guess the point is that the bartender was very willing to accommodate a non-menu item in the middle of a busy day.  My guess is that she won't ever forget how to make them.  

The reason I'm writing this review is because I have been to the Cabo Wabo Cantina in Cabo San Lucas, MX.  I came in expecting a certain vibe and wasn't disappointed.  I wasn't there too long before an authentic Mexican Mariachi band showed up and the place got a little more lively.  All of the servers seemed to be having fun and from my perspective at the bar, the patrons were all having a great time too.  I can't comment on food I didn't eat, but I didn't see anyone complaining or sending items back.  It is a fun place to go if you have some time!
