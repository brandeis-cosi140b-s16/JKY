I really like this Macayo's. The ambience is awesome as is the decor.  You definitely feel like you are at a Mexican Restaurant.  I usually get the cheese crisp and my husband typical will get the steak fajitas.  Both are always really good and we generally don't have food complaints, service is good, and food is hot.  

This location is right next to the light rail so we sometimes park here and eat and then hop on the light rail to a Dbacks game.  Makes us feel a bit more metropolitan ....lol.   The prices are decent, the atmosphere is fun and the food and service are good.  I think its a great place to go if you have company in town, and then walk around the ASU shops in Tempe...makes for a fun and relaxing evening.
