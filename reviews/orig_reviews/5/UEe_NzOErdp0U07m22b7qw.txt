I've had some delicious Mexican food here in Phoenix.  But this place trumps all.  A stocked salsa bar, delicious fish tacos.  Seriously, what isn't good here?  I'm going to keep going here and trying a different menu item every time just to see if something is subpar here.  I'll put my savings on it that there isn't a single thing that isn't good here.  I'd probably go here just for the chips and salsa if Mexican food isn't your thing, but your coworker or spouse or some guy or girl you're going on a date with insists on La Santisima.  Just go.  No excuses.  Nothing.  And order the chips and salsa.  Try every salsa.  I don't care how strange pecan salsa or strawberry salsa sounds...trust me, it won't disappoint.
