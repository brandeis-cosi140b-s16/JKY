Went for lunch. We were greeted promptly, and seated as such. The menu is simple. A small selection of appetizers and entrees. My friend and I decided to sit at the bar after  realizing the chairs at the tables were a bit uncomfortable. The ambience is very nice. Started with the chips and salsa. Very good. There was a sauce that looked like ketchup that was delicious and spicy. My favorite. For tacos, we had the shrimp, the lamb, a beef taco, and the chipotle cherry steak taco. All were fabulous, but one stood out. The chipotle cherry steak taco was out of this world. Amazing. And the wait staff was super friendly. We can't wait to go back!
