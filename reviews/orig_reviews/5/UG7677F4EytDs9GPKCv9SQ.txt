My husband and I are in Charlotte for business this weekend. We went to Chuy's last night for dinner. My husband had the Elvis Green Chile Fried Chicken, and I ordered the Chicka-Chicka Boom-Boom. They were both amazing. The fried chicken was surprisingly crispy, even after being smothered in sauce! We also had the Father Agave margarita and a special drink the bartender put together for me. That bartender was really good at her job!
