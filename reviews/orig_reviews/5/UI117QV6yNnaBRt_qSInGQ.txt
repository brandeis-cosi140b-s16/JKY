I'm a year late in getting this in but better late than never. I had a group of 26 joining us and I called the location and they held a table for us. When we got there, the table was ready and the servers were ready. We had one that took one side of the table and one that took the other side. More friends joined us and they just added another table and never complained. The servers never complained about breaking up the checks and came around often to check on us. We had the games on (Football Season) and even though my Chargers were not a priority game for most, they made it a point to have it on just for me. 

The food was good and the drinks were delicious. I had a drink with coconut on the rim. Yum!

I recommend this location to anyone and everyone who wants to just check out the place or go and enjoy with a large party.
