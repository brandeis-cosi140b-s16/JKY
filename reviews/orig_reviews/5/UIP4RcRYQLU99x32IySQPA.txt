I have never loved tacos. This place changed my mind... The quality and size of their tacos surpasses that of America's (Sorry America's Taco Shop lovers) and it adds a strong local cultural vice that other taco shops lack with its Dia de los Muertos themed paintings. The meat is well-marinated (especially the carne asada) and the dozen-plus salsas are each different by tasty and made to perfection. You can spend ten-to-fifteen minutes just sorting through the salsa bar. I am lucky enough to live nearby and I take advantage of the shark tacos on most days :) I am so glad that it's caught on! I know that I will keep coming back!!!
