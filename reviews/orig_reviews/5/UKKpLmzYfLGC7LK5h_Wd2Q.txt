Delicioso!!!! 

My family and I went with another family. I had a crane asada salad that I loved! The rice and beans in the salad were delightful, and the steak was flavorful! My friend had the pork salad, and she enjoyed it too. 

Two people in my party had crane asada tacos. One had mini tacos and the other had the regular tacos. The guy who had mini tacos said they reminded him of the tacos he had when he lived in Mexico. My husband had the regular tacos, which were far from regular. They had rice, beans, pico, and guac with the meat. 

The kids in our group had nachos. We also ordered chips and salsa and guac. Everything was delectable and reasonably priced. We're just visiting Vegas, but this will be our regular stop when we do. We're going again before we head home!
