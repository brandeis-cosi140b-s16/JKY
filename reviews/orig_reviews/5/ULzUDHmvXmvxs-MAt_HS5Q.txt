Can I just say something? THESE ARE THE BEST TACOS I HAVE EVER TASTED!! My love for this tacos is humongous lol! I'm serious though this place is my first stop when I get to Vegas. 

I think the Adobada(spicy pork) tacos are the best ones! I kid you not I eat like 5 of these ! Haha anyways their fries are really good too! This place is good & it's cheap!! At first if you're unfamiliar with this place everything is going to be confusing! They have 3 separate lines for different kinds of food. Anyways this place is amazing & I recommend it (: !
