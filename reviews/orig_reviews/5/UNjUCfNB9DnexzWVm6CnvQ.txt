Tip: DIVIDE AND CONQUER!!! ...the lines

It's best to come here with a couple of your friends so that you can split up and wait in the different lines for different meats, otherwise, you're going to be waiting in line forever to try the variety they have here. Make sure to look at the signs at the start of each line to know what you're getting in line for!

A bit chaotic like the previous location, but still as delicious as it gets nevertheless. Because we ended up waiting for a full hour for all the food, we definitely felt the need to over-order, ultimately getting almost $120 worth of tacos and fries for 7 people. TACO FEAST!

My favorites: Lengua, Adobada, and Buche! The food here will take your taste buds to taco heaven.
