I first became a fan of sister restaurant Lindo Michoacan on Desert Inn but Bonito is much closer to my home.  

We are "regulars" there so it's nice to walk in and have the waiter or waitress know your order.  

Try the table side guacamole.  It's the best guacamole I've EVER had. And if you can, try to sit in Violeta's section.  She makes it even better than the other waiters. However, Juan and Jose (I think that's his name) are good waiters too.  

The veggies in the fajitas are so fresh and delicious but you can't really go wrong with anything you order here.
