What a hidden gem. Always loved the outdoor taco stand while shopping in the strip...but go downstairs and a surprise awaits. The decor is genuine and interesting. A variety of very comfortable, quality seating choices (high tops, long communal-like tables and traditional seating) peek into windows where tortillas are being made on an old-school conveyor. 

Food is authentic and fresh, high quality ingredients. We have tried all the meats now and each was seasoned very tastily and expertly! A full bar lines one wall... so I imagine its lively on weekends!

From a California transplant, this is the best Mexican food in Pittsburgh.
