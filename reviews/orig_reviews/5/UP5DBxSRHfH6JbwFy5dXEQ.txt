I absolutely love this place! It is a small bay in a strip mall, but don't let that fool you! Seating is a little limited and the lunch hour is busy. Peruse the menu board and place your order at the counter.

The staff are friendly and welcoming! And the smells eminating from the kitchen will have you drooling like Pavlov's dog!

The green chili stew and fry bread is a meal I could eat daily. Another fave is the green chili burrito. It is huge and the flavour is amazing. I occasionally pair this with a machaca taco. A lot of food, so plan for a nap.

Try it out!
