This place serves yummy food.  The mole sauce is delicious, and I love the pomegranates added to the guacamole, as well as the large, thick and crispy chips that accompany it.  

The waiters are helpful in selecting one of their many tequilas to sip.  Or, you can always have a refreshing margarita.  

Want the Pollo en Mole but don't want to pay $19?  Order the Torta de Mole Negro.  It's the same thing but served as a sandwich with fries and a delicious chipotle-kissed ketchup or a small salad.

I really like the atmosphere here--unpretentious yet hip.  There is always interesting art work on the walls, and the music is generally good.

Yay for supporting locally-owned, non-chain restaurants serving authentic Mexican food.
