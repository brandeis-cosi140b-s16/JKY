WOW. WOW. WOW.  The food was seriously amazing.  I loved it.  All of the ingredients made up the perfect meal.  I had the shrimp tacos, which were delicious.  The other people in our party loved their meals too (chicken enchiladas, carnitas tacos).  The service was awesome as well.  The complimentary salsa and chips was great.  You got 3 different salsas, which were all really tasty! Will definitely come back.
