This place is awesome!  We got there when they first opened at 11, were greeted and served chips and salsa and water right away.

Sat outside in the bar area, server was friendly, attentive and prompt. Hubby and I both ordered lunch combos, they were hot, delicious and plentiful!! 

We've been here a few times and it's always a great experience! :)
