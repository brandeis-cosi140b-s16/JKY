Me and the wifey came to have breakfast early Saturday morning.....was craving menudo....so I ordered menudo n the wifey the flautas plate. The waitress who attended us was very sweet n friendly.she took our order n brought us or drinks (large glasses which I like) another lady brought us chips n salsa.....chips were piping hot!!! There was a green n red salsa...I liked the the red better. 
My menudo was delicious just wish they had pata that day...ordered a small refried beans with cheese,  yummy!!!! All the condiments for the menudo was brought n available..
Wifeys Flauta plate looked delicioso!!! She loved it..
Gonna come back n try other menu items soon.
Over all food was delicious...service was awsome n friendly...and the price was great!!!
