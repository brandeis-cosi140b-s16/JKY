A family favorite! We really like most of the food and we have found the service to be good MOST the time.  The price is great- and there is almost always a buy one get one 1/2 off coupon somewhere which makes for a cheap meal out.  The owners always give back to the community by donating to fundraisers, community events etc. so we will be patrons for life.
