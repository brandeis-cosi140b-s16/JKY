Great Mexican authentic food. Read about this place and decided to try it next time I was in Vegas; It's like El Toritos Mexican food but better.  The hot bean dip they bring to the table is good.  I ordered the chese enchilada and beef taco hard shell you don't see hard shells these days anymore.  Service and ambience were good. I would return next time in Vegas.
