A fun, yummy place to go occasionally if you don't live in the area, or frequent if you do, Santos Lucha Libre is an affordable, authentic experience.  From the moment you walk in and are greated by the dummy playing the piano (I'm not saying he's stupid, it's in fact a dummy) to the pictures adorning the walls of Spanish wrestlers, vinyl albums outside the walls of the bathrooms - it's really a unique athmosphere.  5 stars for being casual and fun.

When you walk in, you are greated to a counter where you order your food.  Basically, you want to pick your protiens (chicken done 2 ways, pork 4 ways, beef a couple ways  - ask for samples if you are new to the restaurant) and then they put together your tacos, enchiladas - pick your toppings (very fresh), a few sides to offer like chips and salsa or quac and away you go to your table.  Don't be intimiated by the choices - they are really nice behind the counter, and I can tell these folks are dedicated to their product and it's delivery.  Albeit, the guy that was serving me was very limited on his English.  5 stars for service and food.

Don't expect, because of the 5 star reviews (and if you saw this on yelps top 100) that this place is just going to be a Michelin five star restaurant experience.  The folks that were with me don't like spicey and they enjoyed themselves and loved the food and atmosphere (even two vegans in the group) - this is an all around affordable, authentic, yet amazing and fresh taste experience for just about anyone.  Kudos to the owners and staff for creating a top notch affordable experience!
