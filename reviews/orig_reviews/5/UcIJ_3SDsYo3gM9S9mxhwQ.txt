Wow!!! What a great find.  The stuffed peppers I had were awesome and NOT breaded.  They really take their tequila seriously. The Naranja Margarita was so good we asked for the recipe.  The bartender came out and told us everything from how they infuse their tequila to how they make their Margarita mix.  Our server was very knowledgable about all aspects of the menu.  Will be back very soon!!!!
