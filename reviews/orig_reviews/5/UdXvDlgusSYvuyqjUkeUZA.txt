Their homemade tortillas are OFF THE HOOK good!  Just come for drinks and apps and you'll love it. A marg, some guac and some of the fresh tortillas (corn and flour). Yum! We had a late/light lunch there today. Beans, rice, tortillas and also some friend plantains (WOW!).  Our #1 place when we go to Vegas.
