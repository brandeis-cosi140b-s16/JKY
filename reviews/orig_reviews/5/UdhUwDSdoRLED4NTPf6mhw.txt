Wow who knew you could get Fresh Seafood in the desert.  Our family loves seafood and Baja Joes has now become our favorite place to enjoy it.  We stumbled on this in search for a good lunch spot for the family this past Saturday.  Glad I take some reviews of this place with a grain of salt and tried it for ourselves.  Eva our server was awesome.  Yes you do tend to wait a bit longer for your meals but when they make it all fresh to order that is what you get.  We had the tableside quac and was fabulous.  3 of us split this Seafood sampler with red floured fish that was so moist and amazing, shrimp cooked to perfection, along with grilled and breaded fish cooked to perfection.  The chipotle sauce was outstanding.  Our daughter had the chicken taco salad and loved it.  Flan and fried ice cream to end with what was not to love.  This will definitely be a returning spot for us loved the patio area.
