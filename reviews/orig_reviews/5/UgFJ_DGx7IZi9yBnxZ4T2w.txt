Although the business man special looked rather appetizing. My business skills were not up to par this week enough for me to afford myself such a  luxury. I had the green chili pork, and just like Jim G I thought it was Bomb. I was fortunate though to have one of my business associates there with me , and as he had a great week. He allowed himself the business man special. He got the shredded beef, "best in town". The Taco he had was also said to be bomb. Great meal all around !
