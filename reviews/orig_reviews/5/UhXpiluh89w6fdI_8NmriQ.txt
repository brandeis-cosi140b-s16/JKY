I think it is a great sign when this is the place the local residents head to and you have a wait of 40 minutes.  The margaritas were awesome, the guacamole had dried cranberries in it, which sounds odd but it was surprisingly pretty awesome.   I had chicken mole enchiladas(black sauce) and it was the BEST mole I have ever had.  I would go back in a heartbeat when back in Phoenix!
