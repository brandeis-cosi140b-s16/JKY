this is a MUST go to when I go back to vegas with a rental car.

1) place is a hole in the wall
2) the (korean) young woman was so nice. just like someone you could introduce to your buddy to hook up with nice....
3) the bulgogi burrito is huge. I split it with my women. yeah I know.. i'm fat enough
4) they busted out with free chips, salsa, and guaco dip.

 say whaaaa

then came out the asian sliced orange all from a hole in the wall.

They didn't have the spicy pork my wife wanted but they had a 4 taco for $5 i think... will for sure come back out there.
