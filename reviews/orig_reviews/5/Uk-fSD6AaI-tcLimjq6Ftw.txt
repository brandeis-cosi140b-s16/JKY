Happened upon this incredibly cute taco stand last night after taking the wrong exit.  At the urging of my adventurous son, we pulled up to the drive through with no idea what to order.  The great service began there! We entrusted the "voice" at the menu to provide his input as we were first time customers. He did not steer us wrong.  We had the chicken taco meal. Best tacos ever! Fresh ingredients, made to order! The best part of this whole unexpected experience was the friendly service at the window! Can't wait to return!
