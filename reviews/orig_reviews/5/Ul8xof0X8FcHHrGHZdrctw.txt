One of the things I miss about L.A. is delicious, authentic Mexican food. It took me a long time to finally find amazing Mexican food. Believe me, I have tried. 

We started off with the complimentary chips and salsa. I liked the salsa right away. Then, we ate the camarones aguachiles appetizer. It's big enough to share with 2-3 people. Then, we had the empanadas de camaron, coctel de pulpo, camarones a la diabla, marlin taco, camaron taco, & a hard-shelled shrimp cheese taco which I can't remember the name of (Tubbz?). Holy crap, everything was incredible! 

You always find the best Mexican food at hole in the wall places. You will not find it at any of the casinos or franchises around this town. Minor complaints- I wish the octopus were bigger pieces but not a deal breaker and it's too far from my house!

I'm going to go out on a limb and say if you love seafood and Mexican food with a little kick, you can't go wrong with anything here.
