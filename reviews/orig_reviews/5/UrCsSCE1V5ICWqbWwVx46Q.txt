Didn't think there would be good mexican food in Las Vegas but this place proved me wrong.  The drinks were strong which made them worth the price.  The mojitos were excellent! Other reviews said get the Tuna Ceviche but the wifey didn't give it her Mexican stamp of approval.  She said it was too creamy even though I thought it was pretty good.  I had the pork dinner (I can't remember the name) and it was super tender and very flavorful.  My only complaint was that the rice was hard.  It wasn't too busy when we went and they have indoor and outdoor seating as well as a bar area.  The service is good.  The price is actually not as high as other restaurants in Vegas but still higher than outside Vegas.  Stop by here if you are craving Mexican and are on the southern edge of the Strip.
