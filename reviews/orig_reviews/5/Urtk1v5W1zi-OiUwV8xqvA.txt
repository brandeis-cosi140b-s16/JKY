This place deserves nothing less than five stars.  If I could give it ten I would.  There is so much great with this place.  

First to the people who put down the building and seating you are crazy loco.  Yes you sit at foldable tables and it's more community seating than private but that just fits the feel and the food.  

The food is down right dirty delicious food.  It could easily be featured on the chive.  It's cheap, tasty and served up fast and hot.  The cookies are a perfect top off to the meal.  You can't go wrong with anything on the menu I promise.
