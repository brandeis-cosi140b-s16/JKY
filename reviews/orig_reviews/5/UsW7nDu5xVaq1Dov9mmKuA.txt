Read about this place as having good vegan options when visiting Las Vegas.  Decided to take a chance and boy were we surprised.  The menu had a whole page of vegan items to include burritos, nachos, salads, and tacos.  My husband ordered the spicy tofu burrito which was spicy as the name suggest and full of flavor.  I had the tofu nachos which were incredible.  Our server Erin went out of her way to make our visit wonderful as did the rest of the team of servers.  Next visit to Sin City will include a return visit.  Just wish we had this delicious mexican menu items in San Diego.
