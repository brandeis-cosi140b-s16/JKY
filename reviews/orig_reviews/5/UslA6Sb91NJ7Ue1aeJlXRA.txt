Janice says:  I'm giving this place 5 stars bc it's been 2 years, and at times, i still think of the pork chops i ordered with the apricot/peach sauce....oh how I miss you.  It's the best i've ever had, and my favorite dish of ALL time!  YUM.

Derek says:  I tried bring Janice to a nicer restaurant while we were in Vegas.  But it was much more on the casual side in the Venetian.  At first we were a little dissappointed but then we stuck with it and the food was really well made.  i ordered some kind of fish dish and didnt like it as much as Janice's apricot/peach glazed pork chops.  They are the best porkchops ever.  Cooked perfectly, still juicy inside and a great sauce.  And the place is by the water so thats a plus.
