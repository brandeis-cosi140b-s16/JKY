First, let me apologize for taking so long to review this place. Next, let me say this, Sweet Baby Jesus this place is the TRUTH! Great Scott we have a gem with this spot! By far the best, and I mean the BEST, fish and shrimp tacos I've ever had! An I should know, I'm a beaner! It's in our blood! We invented tacos! The fact that you can do fish alone or shrimp alone is reason enough to try this place, BUUUT... throw in the fact that you can have both in one taco with a cheese filled chile!? Oooooh child errybody  got time fo dat! This place has been my vice ever since I've found this place. I'm always having people go there to try their wholesome goodness. These aren't the skimpy small tacos you'd expect at a taqueria, no sir, these are the real deal tortilla, not no carb friendly serving chingadera. Bask in the glory of a full taco, which subsequently is one of the taco's name on the menu. Although I have stopped going in to order food myself, I always send my lowly sevants, or lot attendants as they are called, to pick me up some deliciousness on taco tuesday. Why? Because it's buy 2 get 1 free! That's 3 tacos! Plaster on some slaw, some cilantro sauce, avacado sauce, a and the pièce de rèsistance: Chipotle sauce... you've got yourself a masterpiece of a taco. 5 stars for this heavenly eatery spot!
