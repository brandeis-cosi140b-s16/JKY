What can I say about this place, aside from that I wish there was a location in my neighborhood! A friend and I came here after receiving recommendation from the hotel we were staying at and I'm so glad they did. 
The service was great - our meals arrived in hardly no time at all. And they were DELICIOUS. The margaritas were great, and STRONG. 
Our waiter was the sweetest, and checked on us regularly to make sure our waters and margaritas were full. It seemed family owned/run, so I'm not surprised by the level of attention, but it was still a great surprise.
