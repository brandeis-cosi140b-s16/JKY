I would never have imagined having quality Mexican food outside of my native Austin, TX, but La Piñata delivers in every category. The decor and ambiance has an authentic, old-school Mexican vibe. The staff are friendly and family oriented. And the food and drinks are truly second to none.
I enjoyed the 3330 and the Copa de Oro margaritas. Both drinks were perfectly balanced in taste, and were not short on spirit.
The Chimichanga (the family's famous original) was well executed to say the least. The tortilla was fluffy and crispy, and the machaca filling was spicy and flavorful.
La Piñata is first rate Mexican food. I can't wait to come back to Phoenix for another visit!
