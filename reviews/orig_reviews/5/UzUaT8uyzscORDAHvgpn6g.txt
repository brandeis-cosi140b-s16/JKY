FIVE stars. Why? Two words: FISH TACOS. Also, three more words: PERSONABLE, FRIENDLY OWNER. 

I didn't think this place was open after 6pm, which is part of the reason why I haven't tried their food yet. However, we left Halloween Mart, drove by, and the lights were on and the OPEN sign was lit up! SCORE. 

Apparently, on THURSDAYS they are open until 9pm because they recently started having some type of car meet up in the parking lot. 

NOW. THE FOOD. The inside is nothing special - not much atmosphere or ambiance. We took a look at the menu and the man behind the counter, who I assume is the owner, came over to us with a huge smile and said, "HOW CAN I HELP YOU LADIES?"

We told him we were first timers. He explained how a few of the menu items are cooked and told us what his favorites were. As soon as he said FISH TACOS, my eyes lit up. I ordered one fish taco and one adobada taco with rice and beans. My girlfriend ordered one carne asada taco and one adobada taco - TO GO. While we were waiting, the same nice man came and chatted with us for a while, asking us where we were from and he actually engaged in some awesome and genuinely friendly conversation. I was very impressed with his hospitality! 

Our food was ready in a few minutes and as soon as I got home, I took one bite into that fried, crispy, juicy, flaky, white fish topped with lettuce and cilantro and a creamy sauce, and I just about died right then and there. Died with pleasure of course. :) Honestly, probably the second best fish taco I have ever had in my entire life, and I don't play around when it comes to fish tacos. 

The adobada meat was slightly dry and lacked a bit in flavor. The beans and rice were amazing. i can't quite put my finger on the spice/flavor that made them taste different, but there's definitely something special about them. 

Regardless, I cannot give less than 5 stars because of the beautiful explosion of taste that came out of that fish taco. I will be back!
