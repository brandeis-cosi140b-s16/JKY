Yes, I love Carolina's.  It's pretty damned good.

If you haven't been there then I suggest you check it out.  Even if only to experience the atmosphere and not necessarily the food.  But the food will keep you coming back.

I wish I lived closer but it's probably a good thing that I don't.  I'd be eating foot-long Oaxaca burritos ($4.45) everyday.  I love them.  A Oaxaca burro consists of potatoes, beans, chorizo and cheese, and it's Sonoran bliss.  I also love the red chile burros.  I'm a burro guy so I pretty much stick to anything rolled in a tortilla.  

Criticisms:  Seating area sucks.  Inefficient use of existing space (what's up with no seating in that first room area?), that's about it.

Definitely go there.  And give me a call or a PM when you are so I can give you my order.
