Loved this place. I've had menudo in Tucson, El Paso and home made by my ex-mother in law, Mexican from Juarez, and I liked this one better...

The chips were made to order, the salsa was really good and the place was clean, including the restrooms. Staff was friendly and good prices. Too bad I don't live in Phoenix.
