the PAPUSA!! YES!
New York Strip Steak...cooked perfectly.
Obdulio's ribs...OMG
The flourless chocolate cake with chilis and cinnamon...which I try to make at home and am getting closer and closer everyday.




Why are people so whinny and pissy? Get the stick out of your ass and eat good food :) 

Champaign is a growing palace of local ingredients and inventive restaurants. Go Champaign!
