A co-worker chose Steel Cactus for her going away party. I made a (somewhat late) party reservation via email with the events manager, Michele. She was very helpful and accommodating, and squeezed us in on the rooftop even though there were already parties booked. There is no reservation fee for parties, but Michele did mention that there is a spending minimum for larger parties (our reservation was for 20 people).

I loved the rooftop seating. It's open air with a clear glass/plastic roof, so that you have a view but don't have to worry if the weather turns bad. 

Our server was attentive and accommodated a couple of special requests with our order. I don't like Mexican food, so I didn't eat much. But I have to say that that the queso was delicious, and my colleagues enjoyed their food. The drinks are overpriced (to be expected) but I thought they were good and rather strong. 

Overall, I would recommend this place and I hope to return for the rooftop seating before summer is over!
