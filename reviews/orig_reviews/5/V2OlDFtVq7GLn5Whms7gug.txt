This place is fantastic!

My gf and I came here for a joint celebration (her graduating from grad school and me passing the NV bar). 

She had the scallops, I had the strip steak. Both were absolutely amazing! For drinks, she had a mojito and I had the poloma (sp?) and both were awesome! The environment here is romantic, the place is quiet and fancy inside. The service was great, the servers were very attentive and helpful!

I highly highly recommend this gem!
