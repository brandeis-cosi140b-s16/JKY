Best Mexican food in AZ. Im from California and have lots of family in Mexico, I feel like I am out there, the food is delicious and recommend it to anyone. This is real Mexican food, I'm very glad I came here and left very satisfied. Only thing missing is a bar. lol TEN STARS! new favorite spot. Number eleven was fire and so was the al pastor taco, I'm picky with the al pastor but this blew me away, top three in my book. Great spot!!
