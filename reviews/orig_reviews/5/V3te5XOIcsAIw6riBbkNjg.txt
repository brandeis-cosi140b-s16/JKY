We just flew in from SD for a wedding and this is the first place we hit up since it was close to the hotel. We were here on a Thursday evening, live music and good food ~ what more can I ask for? 

Our waiter was great and the atmosphere was fun. We were seated in the patio area near the live music and a perfect spot for me to people watch. Yes, I'm a low-key stalker...j/k.

It was too early in the evening for me to booze it up but it looks like it could be a really fun place to come back to.

I tried to stay on my eating clean health kick which it really hard in Vegas but I got the Cobb Salad and water. I forget what my hubby ordered but it looked really delish. The service was quick. We never felt rushed and everything was priced accordingly for Vegas. 

I'd definitely come back but this time I'll try some of there other menu items and maybe booze it up a little.
