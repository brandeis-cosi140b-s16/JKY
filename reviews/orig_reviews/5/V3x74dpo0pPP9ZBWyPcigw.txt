Wow!!!! Outstanding food. Enjoyed every bite. Had 3 tacos and Kim chi fried rice. I don't even like Kim chi that much but this was to die for. My son had the Flautas. I had a bite of those and they were great. The whole family is waiting to go back and we will. Service was great. Never waited long for anything. We didn't go to Decatur we went to the one on buffalo. Couldn't find it so I wrote this down anyway.
