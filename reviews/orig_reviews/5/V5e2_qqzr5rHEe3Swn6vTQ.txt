Oooh man where do I start! 

For starters lets talk about the great customer service. I thought they had closed for the evening so I got back into my car and I noticed the guy who was cleaning around the restaurant come out to let me know they were still opened and to come on in. He could have simply just let me leave but he didn't and I really appreciated that. He was very friendly, we had a small conversation going. Any who while we were chatting it up I told him it was my first time here and that I used to come by when it was a burger spot little did I know they are the same owners! I loved their burgers and I'm glad I can still get them! I digress he also gave me samples of the different meats such as the chicken, pork, red and green chile, the barbacoa. I thought that was so kind of him. The meats are delicious and some tasted just like how my Abuelita makes it so it's a win for me! 

I also like the fact that they serve menudo and posole on the weekends. Most Mexican restaurants only have menudo. 

I will definitely be back with my mom and grandparents.

Let me stop typing and get back to my delicious carne asada burrito!
