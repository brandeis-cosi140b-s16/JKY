Just love it !!  Good interesting menu, have loved everything we tried.  They nailed it with the decorating.  Love that the owners are Arcadia graduates.  They are so friendly.  The only negative I have is the servers,  I can't put my finger on it just felt like we were putting her out when we asked with taco plate were which, ( my faves were the short rib.)  Don't want to dwell on that because the place is so awesome.  Oh and they have growlers they can fill up, Orange Blossom is so good.
