Fantastic food! I enjoyed the Enchanted platter that had three different samples of other main courses on it. As someone that only likes a little bit of spice, this was PERFECT! It also comes with rice and beans and a sopapilla! Have to ask for some honey for the sopapilla... SO GOOD! The outside patio is a really nice place to sit and enjoy the company of others. We will return!
