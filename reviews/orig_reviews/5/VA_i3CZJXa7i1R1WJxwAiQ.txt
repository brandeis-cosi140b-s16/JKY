Oh my gosh, heaven!! 

Walking inside of the place I wasn't expecting to see such a monstrosity of a restaurant. It's just huge. There's a large panaderia right when you walk in where you can order tasty Mexican pastries. You walk down a little ways and order your meal at the counter. There's a salsa bar to the right with all sorts of great salsas from spicy to mild, to avocado, etc. 

I ordered the Super Nachos and they were so good! I didn't want to stop eating them and literally gorged myself until I couldn't lift another chip into my mouth.
