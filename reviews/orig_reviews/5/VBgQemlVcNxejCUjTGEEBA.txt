My parents and I were so satisfied with this restaurant that i don't even know where to begin.  First off the chips and salsa were amazing.  They had three kinds of chips.  Wonton's, Regular chips, and Sweet potato chips. I got the chimichanga and WOW so freaken gooooood!!!  I would definitely get it again! At the end of the meal they give you a corn husk filled with white chocolate(not a tamale, like everyone keeps saying) which was very quite delightful. Also the setting was so beautiful.  I have never been to a place that gorgeous before and to top it off my parents hate sitting outside but this place they rather of sat outside then inside! lol.

P.S. I went in January of 2012 just forgot to finish my review. =]
