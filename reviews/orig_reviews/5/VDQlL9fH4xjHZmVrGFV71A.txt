What makes this place special is the salsa bar like none other.  Some are good on the complimentary chips; others are good with your order.  It's up to you to find out.  The oversized paintings reminiscent of Kahlo and Rivera adorn the walls.  Frida and Diego also appear in the pictures, and, yes, we're on a first name basis.  The restaurant was just about empty when we entered on a Friday night.  Hopefully, this was because it is new.  Pssst, you're missing out.  I had fish tacos and my Frida had some vegetarian dish.  Both of us were very happy.  They didn't have margaritas, just beer.  But I keep trying to order a margarita every time I go for good measure.
