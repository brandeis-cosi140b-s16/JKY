I totally dig this place. The ambiance, the food, and the bartenders all work for me. Dulia, a bartender, is a total doll. Their margaritas are strong and decently priced. They do have food, but the menu is small. Me and my friend shared two appetizers: the fish tacos and the quesadilla, and an order of onion rings and were happily stuffed and it only cost us $10 each. Once it gets later this place totally fills up and people dance, drink, and have a good time. The sinks being outside of the bathrooms is kind of odd but not really a big deal. Its totally worth checking out if you are on Mill.
