BEST micheladas in Vegas hands down.

My review is for the bar ONLY, I did eat here a few years back but only stopped by for Micheladas and beer this time around. Let me add that their beer was ICE cold and oh so delish.

Service was good, bartenders we're nice and fast. Make a stop here to cure your Vegas hangover with a cold and delicious Michelada, you'll thank me later =)
