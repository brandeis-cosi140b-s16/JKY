I AM OBSSESED WITH THESE TACOS!!!! Right now i dont live any where near any of their current locations, but I ALWAYS make the trip. Im so excited for the new location opening 10 mins from my house!!! Anyways, my fav are the tacos de adobada with the guac dressing topped of with abit of lime and radish....HEAVEN!! I know a couple of the employees there and they are always very nice! Definately a MUST TRY for authentic tacos.
