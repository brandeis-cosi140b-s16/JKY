This review is for the drive thru part of the restaurant. The window girl was so nice and she was fun to talk to. I love nice people and I'm always so impressed by it in customer service because unfortunately it seems it's few and far between nowadays. More people should love their jobs and enjoy their customers it makes for a better day for everyone. I know because I have worked worth the public for 20 plus years. Anyways sorry for the rant, lol. She was awesome and made me want to come back. The food was good all we got was chips and fried ice cream but both were yummy as usual. The fried ice cream could have used a tad more honey but still good. Love this place and love that I live close and can get drive thru good that isn't fast food. Plus the prices are a tad lower than the actual restaurant.
