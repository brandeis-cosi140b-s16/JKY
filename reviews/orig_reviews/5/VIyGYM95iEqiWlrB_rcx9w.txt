First time here!!! I've heard about this place from a couple of my friends. They said they've eaten here in California and now they have 2 locations in Las Vegas. Since I was at Container Park & was super hungry, I decided to give this place a try. 

I'm very picky with my Mexican food since I come from a town were Mexican food is every authentic.  I ordered the beef flatuas and mmm mmm mmm it was AMAZING!!!! Very moist & tasty. Sorry to say but a lot of Mexican restaurant make their flatuas dry and yucky but NOT here!!!!     

The staff was very friendly and the food runner was very impressive. He must have carried at least 6-8 plates of food on one arm. I totally recommend this restaurant.
