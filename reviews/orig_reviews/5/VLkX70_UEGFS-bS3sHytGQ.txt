First, let me explain...  I don't give a five star rating unless I really think something is really good and unique. 

With that said, I really enjoyed the food and the service at Braddah's Island Style. 

I'm a cab driver here in town and I'm often asked for places to go and things to try that are unique to Las Vegas.  This is definitely gonna make the regular list of suggestions! 

Being from Hawaii, I wasn't sure what this was gonna taste like.  Kalua pig tacos?  Huli huli chicken burritos?  What is this??  I'll tell you what it is...  IT'S DELICIOUS!!  I knew what kalua pig tasted like on its own but I had NO IDEA how ONO this could be in a taco! 

The service here is fast, friendly and awesome.  Everyone coming thru the door is greeted almost immediately and the ordering process is quick and straightforward.  For this, being my first visit, I ordered the three tacos (one huli huli chicken and two kalua pig) and told them to prepare them the way they thought it would taste best.  

I guess what I was most impressed about was the overall attitude of the employees and the taste of the food.  Great job!

This is definitely just the FIRST of MANY trips to Braddah's!
