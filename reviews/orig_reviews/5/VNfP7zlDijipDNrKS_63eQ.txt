Love love love this place..... I am in town with my fam vacating for a week... MY husband found this place in yelp. When arriving, didn't know what to think of it... From outside doesn't look that much of a restaurant and going inside it is too small of a space. Only 2 servers working 12 tables... 

I had Gaucho Burro, it was more than enough.. Perfect portion. And I recommend trying the horchata too. 

Authentic Mexican food!! Tasty food, and nice servers. Simply this place is officially my favorite new place...
