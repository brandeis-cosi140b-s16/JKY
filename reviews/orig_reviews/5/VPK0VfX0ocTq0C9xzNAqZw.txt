I love this restaurant for many reasons... 

Great service, great atmosphere, and great food! 

I recommend the Pork Chops, Seabass, or the Meatloaf. All the Margaritas are awesome. 

Located in Old Town Scottsdale this is a great place to start your night then head out the the bars after a great meal and a few drinks.
