I had the rib tacos and Dulce de Leche shake!  The tacos were great!  The shake was unbelievably good.  The young lady who waited on me was extremely nice.  They were amazingly busy not only inside the small restaurant but also in the drive-through line. On my next trip I have to try a burger.  They were selling burgers by the shopping bag full. Great little place!
