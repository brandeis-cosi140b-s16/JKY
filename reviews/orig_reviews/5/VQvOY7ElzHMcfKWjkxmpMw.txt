Great restaurant our regular waiter Manuel is one of the best waiters in the valley.  The gua tableside is great, draft Mexican beer is perfect.  Happy hr margaritas are excellent.  Now the food.  The Casabel ribeye is well lets just say fabulous, great halibut, and other southwestern dishes.  This is not a traditional beans and rice joint.  Its great  . Oh every few months they have a tequila dinner to die for
