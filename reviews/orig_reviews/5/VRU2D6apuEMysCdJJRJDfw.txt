Hallelujah!, they're back & better than before. It's taken me too long to finally visit Viva Mercado at their new location. We were pretty taken aback walking in: huge, bold, warm, pristine. Everyone was incredibly lovely, from the host to our waiter. Chips: yum. Salsa: yum. Water: strangely, also yum. We've been encountering taste issues, in the past couple months, with guacamoles but Viva Mercado did not disappoint! Be warned: they provide a plate of sauteed onion & peppers. I thought they were green pepper & popped a big ol' piece in my mouth... after seeing my life flash before my eyes, I realized they were actually jalapenos! I wasn't terribly hungry so I ordered a bowl of fideo & it was not only the best fideo I've had, it was one of my favorite soups! My partner in crime agreed, once having her pre-entree cup of it. She got the verde carne asada enchiladas & was very satisfied (& able to take half home). We'll definitely be back soon & frequently! Felt like the perfect place for cozy winter meals.
