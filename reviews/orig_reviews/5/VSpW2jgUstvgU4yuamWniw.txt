If you like sampling things, you are hungry, and like seafood order the Cabo Azul ($30 price range). It includes one seafood stuffed chile relleno, one lobster enchilada and one shrimp taco, accompanied by white rice and black beans. Everything here was wonderful including the service. 

Large margarita menu at about $15 each. Premium tequilas only. Only complaint was that they wouldn't seat half of our party of 4 until we were all there and there were plenty of open tables.
