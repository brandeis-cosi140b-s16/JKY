fan-tastic!  every time o go to the rokerij, it gets better. definitely THE most solid restaurant in phoenix in my eyes. the carne adovada is THE SHIT!  hard to even order different dishes when it's this good...

i prefer eating in the downstairs bar - the place is like a bunker. no at&t service so you can just turn your phone off and kick back. 

i can say that the jalape√±o and rokerij benedicts are killer as well. great enchiladas...  i could go on and on.
