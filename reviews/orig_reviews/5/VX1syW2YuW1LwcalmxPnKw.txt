We loved this place!  What a find!  Great service, Reasonable price and nice environment. We both had the Texas Burger and found it to be excellent.... Interesting combination adding a French Fried Onion Ring to a burger with BBQ sauce and cheese. One of the best burgers in town.  Next time we'll carry out and enjoy our lunch at one of the week end concerts at the park down the street.
