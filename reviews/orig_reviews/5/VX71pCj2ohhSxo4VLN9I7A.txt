If you like Mexican/Southwestern food you need to try this place. It is the best Mex. in Las Vegas. I had the "Intervention" tostada with red New Mexican chile sauce, carne avodova (shredded beef), cheese sauce, and toppings. It was simply awesome. Portion was large, everything was fresh. My wife had the tamales. Those were awesome too! They have a tamale specialist chef come in and make them from scratch.
I will be back, often.
