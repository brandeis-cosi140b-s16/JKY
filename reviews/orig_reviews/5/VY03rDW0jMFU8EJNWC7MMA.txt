This is a local, family business, the type we find has the best food and the friendliest people.  Everything is cooked to order, so it takes a little time. No microwave in sight. I was told some of the recipes were handed down from the Grandmother., a  lot of it seems to be Guadalajara, Jalisco dishes. I like the Calamari Tacos and Lobster Enchiladas. They don't have Lobster every day, usually Friday, and only if it looks good to them. There are a few breakfast items if you go in earlier. Everything I've tried here was good, and the staff is great!] The flan is also excellent for dessert.
