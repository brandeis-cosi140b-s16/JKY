Las Palmas isn't just tacos, it's a way of life. 

That being said, this place is AMAZING. $2.50 per taco?! Endless toppings?! Mexican coke in glass bottles?! Get outta town! This place has it all! By far one of my favorite places to eat...ever. The chicken tacos and the BBQ beef are my go-tos along with their salsa, pico de gallo, and endless lemons! I can't say enough good things about this place. You just need to experience it to truly believe it!

Just as a sidenote, the salsa at the toppings bar aren't labeled...do yourself a favor (if you're not into spicy salsas) and avoid the deep red salsa. Unless you're SUPER into spicy (trust me, I'm a lover of spice, but I couldn't handle this salsa!), I would steer clear. I tried it once and it literally made my mouth hurt. Other than that, everything is solid and delicious! 

I'm constantly craving them. It's gotten so bad that I think of the amount of money I have in terms of how many tacos I can purchase at Las Palmas. So give it a go! You won't be sorry.
