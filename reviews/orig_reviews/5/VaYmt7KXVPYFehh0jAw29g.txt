My husband and I just moved here from AZ and we just love, love this place.  The service is always as wonderful as the food is.  
The owner is the wonderful lady in the kitchen cooking the food.
Yum,yum!!!  I have to say we have only been here a month and have almost been here for lunch or dinner about 20 times. Yes it's that good.
