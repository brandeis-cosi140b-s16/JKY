My five stars is for them having the best hard shelled tacos I've had in Vegas!
Aside from that, the food is good and the service is great. My boyfriend ordered a michilada. He absolutely did not like it so he complained. Juan came out to apologize, and said he would take it back and attempt to make it the way my boyfriend liked it, spicy and full of flavor. When Juan came out with the new michilada, he did not disappoint. My boyfriend says it's THE BEST michilada he's had in this city. GREAT SERVICE! We will definitely be back for the michiladas & tacos!
