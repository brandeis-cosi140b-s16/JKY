I come here way too often, but the enchiladas are so good. You can get up to three and try up to five different fillings. It's got a chipotle style of ordering only you don't have to worried about them busting your burrito and it's more delicious. 

Both their red and green sauces are good but I prefer the red cause it's spicier and has a bit more flavor. Their jalape√±o ranch dressing makes a pretty great topping for both salads an enchiladas, and they stock a decent variety of beers. 

The only problem: they don't have enough locations.
