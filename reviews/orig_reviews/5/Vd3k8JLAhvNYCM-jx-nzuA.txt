Clean, affordable, delicious, genuine, friendly, established (twenty years) - Juan's lives up to its name. 

Do you remember when a kid's menu was affordable? It still is here. 

It's open seating, and you pay at the counter. 

Watch the zen in the kitchen. 

It's a mature restaurant; would not be surprised if they expand soon.
