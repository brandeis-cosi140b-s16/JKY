Seriously the best burgers in the valley! I love PVBC. The service is prompt and the food is amazing. The fries are great, they come with a sweet and spicy seasoning which is delicious. I love the paradise bacon cheeseburger, the bacon is great quality. And the pickled onions are so yummy. Definitely check this place out!
