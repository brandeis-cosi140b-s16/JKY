This is a fun place to eat and drink when entertaining visitors. Alex the hostess took us to our table and that's where the fun began. We got a pitcher of margs and chips and salsa to start. Then, we shared calamari, a melted cheese dish, fish tacos and a huge steak burrito. Everything came out quick.  The music added to the casual, fun atmosphere. Oh, and we had a non-drinker with us and the raspberry iced tea was delish!  Our friends loved the people watching.
