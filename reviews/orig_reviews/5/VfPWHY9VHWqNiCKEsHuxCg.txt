Yesterday was my third visit to La Ristra. They were hosting a fundraiser for a local charity, and the place was busy. I found the staff to be very friendly. 
In the past I've had their Carnitas plate and enchiladas but had their farmers burrito on this trip. I have to say, I have been beyond pleased with every meal I've had. The meat was seasoned to perfection, and prepared perfectly. 
I highly recommend several trips here. I don't think you'll be disappointed.
