The man can cook... the ahi tuna appetizer, shrimp tamale, and the carnitas were all top notch.. and the warm bread pudding desert topped off the meal to perfection. The old La Madonna location was much easier for us to get to, so we will not get the opportunity to visit as often, but we will look forward to it whenever we can. You should do the same... this is one of the better restaurants in all of Vegas.
