This has to be the best New Mexico-style restaurant in the Valley.  My family and I come here often, and I always try to talk friends into coming with me.  Their red and green chili come in mild or hot.  If you choose hot, please be prepared for HOT.  They only use Hatch chilis, so anything with chili on it is going to have lots of delicious Hatch chili flavor.  My favorite is either the rellenos or the stuffed sopapillas--sopapillas stuffed with your choice of ground beef, shredded beef, or chicken, covered in your choice of red or green sauce and cheese.  I usually go with the delicious marinated chicken and hot green sauce.  Lots of other commenters also commented on the chips and salsa, and those reviewers didn't lie!  The chips and salsa are great!  You could practically just fill up on the chips and salsa and skip the rest of the meal, it is that good!

The service is always quick and the waiters/waitresses are friendly and knowledgeable.  Also, they have a full bar and amazing margaritas.  The food always tastes fresh, you'll never feel like you're getting yesterday's beans and rice.  If you're tired of Manuel's, Serrano's, or Garcia's, definitely give Si Senor a try.  I have NEVER had a bad experience there.
