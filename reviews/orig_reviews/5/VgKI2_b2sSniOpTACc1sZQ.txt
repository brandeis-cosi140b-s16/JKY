I had girlfriends in town for a bachelorette party last weekend from Hawaii...we were scrambling for what to do (didn't want to go to a claustrophobic  MEGA club and spend tons of $$$).  Luckily we met a promoter for Diablos Cantina who gave us $20 all you can drink bracelets...Let the party begin!!  We drank and danced on the rooftop patio all night....the band was amazing!  After we had a few drinks we were starving and ordered the Nachos...sooo good and fed all 5 of us.  You can look out over the strip while you party it was so cool.
