My new favorite Mexican restaurant.  I have been to the other Taquitos Jalisco many times on Gilbert road, I like that place a lot, but this is even better.  The food is fresh and delicious... The salsa you get with the chips and salsa is probably the best I have ever had.  Can't say enough good things about this restaurant.
