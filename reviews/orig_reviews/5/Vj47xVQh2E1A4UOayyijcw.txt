So, Gabi did it again!  She somehow found the perfect spot to mingle with fellow yelpers, and MINGLE we did!  I don't know if it was the Coronas or the guacamole, but for some odd reason all of my inhibitions flew out the nicely decorated adobe windows.  I found myself chatting with some very interesting people and thoroughly enjoyed myself.

When I first arrived (@5:25pm) there weren't too many people here.  Scott reminded me that it was still a bit early, so I took advantage and GOT MY DRINK ON.  Eventually, a group of blue hairs came in and got the party started (not really, they just sat down and ordered food, but that would make an awesome story, right?!) 

I saw some familiar faces from past events Julia, Dottsy, & Robert. Sorry, I don't nag my weak memory with last initials, but I also met some GREAT new faces.

Thanks, Gabi! I dunno how you do it, but somehow you always do!
