My husband and I came here because of the great yelp reviews and it totally lived up to the expectation. When we first pulled up I questioned myself because its kind of a dive type place. Bottom line: the food was AMAZING! Probably some of the best stuff I have ever eaten. I don't live anywhere near and am craving it all the time now ;( Will someone mail me some? Ill have their awesome pastor, diablo chicken and jerk rice! thanks.
