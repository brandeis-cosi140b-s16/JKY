This place is simply fantastic. 

The decor and atmosphere is chic and comfortable. It's well decorated and very pleasant. It's a pretty small location, but definitely a bright option in the downtown area. 

The food was amazing. There's some items left over from the previous menu, and some new modern Mexican choices. There's a nice selection of options. The food is prepared fresh, making customization easy. 

The servers were very friendly, and service was quick. I'll definitely be back.
