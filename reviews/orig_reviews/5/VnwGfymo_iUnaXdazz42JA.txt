My husband and I come here on a weekly for taco Tuesday. We have had the best experience with our bartender, Michael. He has always been amazing.  He always recommends drinks, tacos or specials. Michael is great.  This is the best consistent service we have ever gotten anywhere.  We have brought family and friends here to enjoy the experience! ! Thank you Michael and Baja Joe's for the mini escape! !!!
