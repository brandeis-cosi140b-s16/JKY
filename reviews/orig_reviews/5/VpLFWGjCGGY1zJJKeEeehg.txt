We love the Kingman el palacio so we were hoping it would be just as good .                 SURPISE 
It was even better ! After checking in with YELP we recieved a coupon for 1 free appetizer with 2 entrees . Yeah ! We ordered the fiesta platter ($9.99) it was mini tacos , taquitos, nachos & cheese quesadilla . The platter was ok, but I wouldn't order it again. My bf & I ordered the carne asada burrito with rice ($12.99) this was fantastic ! The beef was grilled and seasoned perfectly . Tortilla tasted homemade as did the rice .. My fav part was at the end when we got little strawberry roll ups with whipped cream . So cute so tasty .. Can't wait to come back
