My new obsession!  I'm from southern NM and I'm picky about Mexican food.  This place is for you if you like imaginative,quality food in a relaxed atmosphere.  Margaritas are made from freshly squeezed lime juice.  Fresh ingredients in the food make me want to go back again and again.  Try their tamale!  It's not your grandmother's version, but a fresh, flavorful taste of heaven.  Add the mango slaw on top.  Carne asada is yummy too.
