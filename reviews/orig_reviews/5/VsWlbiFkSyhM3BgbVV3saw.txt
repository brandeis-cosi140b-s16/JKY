Gadzooks is amazing!!! Wish I didn't live in Scottsdale so I could eat this more often. Cool staff, better food. I always have to get 3 enchiladas because I can't decide on one meat. Short rib, pork, and chicken. All good. Then I can't decide on sauce so I go half red and green across all of them. Then I can't decide on cheese so I get both. It's all just SOOOO good. Everyone needs to eat here. Please open more locations!!! chipotle sucks!
