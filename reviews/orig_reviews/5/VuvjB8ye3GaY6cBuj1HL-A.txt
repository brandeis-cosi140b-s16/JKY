Wonderful atmosphere, excellent drinks, attentive service. This was the best mexican food experience I have had in Las Vegas so far.
I wrote a tip on yelp about the chicken dish we ordered, unfortuanltly I cant find that section right now, ask your server for a popular chicken dish they serve. It was so tasty and spicy I can't wait to go back and eat it again!
Definitely try to get there earlier or make reservations if you can, when we were leaving there were people waiting.
