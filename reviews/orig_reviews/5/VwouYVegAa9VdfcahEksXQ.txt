We ate here again the other day with my brother and mother.  This time, I got the Chimichanga with shredded beef and sopapillas for dessert.  I really liked the flavor of the beef in the entr√©e. It was not over powering and had just the right amount of spice to it.  Again, we all got soup with our meals, free beans, salsa, and chips.  They also brought tortillas when we asked.  I got the dessert to go and ate it at home. You can get an order of 3 or 6.  We got the six and had some left over the next day.   It came ready to go with butter, honey and cinnamon sugar.  Again, Juan, the owner, was very visible and came to all of the tables to check on the meal.  Very nice!
