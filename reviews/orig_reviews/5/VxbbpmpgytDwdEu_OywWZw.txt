Came here on cinco de mayo and it was a packed house! Even though it was, the wait for food was not bad at all and you always had chips and salsa and margaritas filled while you wait. With cheap prices you consider quality over quantity but with this restaurant, it wins both!!! As much as I want to keep this place a secret... I highly recommend for others to try it out. The secrets out!!
