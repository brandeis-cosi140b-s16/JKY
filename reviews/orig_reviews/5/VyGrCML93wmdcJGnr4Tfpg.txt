Hands down one of my favorite restaurants anywhere. With a few exceptions, I've tried most of the menu and I can say that everything is superb. The quesadillas have a hand-made corn tortilla that is almost like a pastry. Whether it's filled with al pastor or arrachera steak, it will not disappoint. The cochinita pibil and chicken tinga are also do-not-miss items. 

The fresh salsa bar has some very unique and delicious offerings, in particular the pecan, strawberry, and chile de arbol salsas.

The service is always super friendly and the decor is very inviting. 

I sincerely look forward to enjoying La Condesa for years to come!
