The Stand made me very happy.  Cheeseburgers made from fresh ground in house beef, perfectly melted cheese, fresh leaf lettuce, thick sliced tomatoes, onion, pickle and secret sauce.  Lemonade made in house with real lemons, Hand-spun shakes made with real ice cream (Dulce de leche is out of this world good!) 

The interior is very small with a handful of tables but a few more outside on the covered patio.  Service is friendly and quick and no sooner did I finish my Lemonade when an employee offered me a refill!  In what crazy, alternate, fast food world does that happen??? For those who do not like to leave the car, the stand has a drive up window.  Taco's are also offered and I would like to try them on my next visit.  

The Stand is opened 11am to 11pm 7 days a week.
