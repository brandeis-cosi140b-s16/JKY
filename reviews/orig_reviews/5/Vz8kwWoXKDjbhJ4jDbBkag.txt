I can only review the maragaritas and tableside guacamole at Diego's as my husband and I only stopped by here on a whim to start out our night with some apps and drinks ... but when we were done and leaving I was left wishing we didn't have a reservation at a different restaurant because I was DYING for some more yummy mexican food!  

5 stars on all counts : seated us quickly in the fun and funky bar area on a nice cushy booth type seat.  an IMMENSE margarita/tequila menu with some of our favorite harder-to-find tequilas.  the delicious, fresh, salty chips came with a trio (or was it quartet?) of amazing salsas ranging from the mild pico to the kicky green stuff to the hot hot chipotle one.  my giant margarita was delicious (my benchmark for rating a mexican place is their margarita - I'm a lime and salt and tequila girl!).  the service was great, attentive but not too over the top, they could tell that we wanted to be left alone to our canoodling (what? - don't you canoodle in Vegas?!).  and the guacamole.  oh, their guacamole.  you've got to hope that when you pay close to twenty buckaroos for a smash up of avocados and some onions and jalape√±os that it's going to be worth it ... and yes, this guac is worth it. i dream about this guacamole.  I can't wait to go back to Vegas and when I do then this guacamole will be one of the first things to touch my lips.  So good.    

Loved loved loved Diego's!
