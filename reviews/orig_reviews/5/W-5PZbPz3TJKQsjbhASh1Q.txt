This is our second visit and both my wife and I have decided that Frank and Fina's has taken over 1st place in our Mexican food restaurant preference.   

We have been here for both dinner and now lunch.  Both times we have received excellent service, high quality and diverse menu options, and to our satisfaction, the best chips and salsa beginnings to our meals.

For dinner, I had the chicken bomba and it was very flavorful with a slight twist on the traditional chicken fajita dish.  The bomba comes with mushrooms, red and green peppers, cheese and all the traditional fixings.  

The lunch taco plate was perfectly balanced components and just the right amount of food.  

My wife had the beef enchilada plate for dinner and liked it so well she ordered it again for lunch on this visit.

We will keep coming back and recommend this place highly!
