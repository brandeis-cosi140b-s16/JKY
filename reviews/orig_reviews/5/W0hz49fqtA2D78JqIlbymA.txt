Originally my first choice was extremely packed and after reading some of the great  reviews here I had to give it a chance.  The food, location and service were great and I will HIGHLY recommend this place to anyone that's looking for some great food at a good price. The staff was friendly, my waiter was very helpful and although they were busy, they kept things moving and while keeping an eye on everybody. Plus, the food was delicious (had the fish tacos and chips with queso) and also I enjoy the fact you could to a reservation online as well (left my first choice at 830, set appointment online for 9pm, got there and check in at 845pm and by text I was informed two minutes later they had a table) so I was happy my second choice was a superb option. 

Now, with this fantastic review you will be wondering why it didn't get the 5 stars and it's only because I was told to removed my hat. Honestly, if I'm there to eat, why does it matter if I have my hat on since it won't be bothering anyone? ***UPDATE*** MANAGEMENT READ MY REVIEW AND CONTACTED ME ABOUT THAT POLICY NOT BEING THE CASE WHICH SHOWS THEIR LEVEL OF GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE AND I THANK THEM FOR CLEARING THAT OUT. I WAS COMING BACK BEFORE BUT NOW I CAN SAY I WILL BE BACK FOR EVEN MORE IN THE FUTURE 

Anyway, that still doesn't take away it is a great place and I will be back again.
