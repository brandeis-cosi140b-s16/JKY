The Original Burrito Co. was another regular spot for us when we lived in Phoenix.  The portions were generous and the prices were more than fair.  They had a great variety of fare to suit your taste.  You can go authentic or a bit non traditional and it is always made right.  They make some of the most perfect breakfast combos you could want.
Since moving away we always use OBC as the measuring stick when we get burritos.  Still have not found any place that measures up.  
My favorites, the Fish Burrito, the Veggie Mixto and the Marco Polo.  But try them all!
