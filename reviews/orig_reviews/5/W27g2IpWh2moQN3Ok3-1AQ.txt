This is a must try for anyone in Las Vegas! Located in the Arts District this place makes sure you feel like you are in a hip and exciting place.  Now about the food, speechless does not begin to express how good the food is.   My amazing wife had the Red Sangria and could not stop raving about it,  and she knows her Sangria for sure.   We hope they get into the brunch business with a bottomless option for sure!
