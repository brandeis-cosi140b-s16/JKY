Drunkingly I looked up from the Casino in the Luxor and saw "Tacos and Tequila" and exclaimed "THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I WANT RIGHT NOW!  TACOS AND SOME TEQUILA!!!"

That's exactly what I got.  We were there for the "Mariachi Brunch."  The food was so good (and I live in the Mission district of San Francisco so I have from pretty high standards on Mexican food)  The drinks were even better.  (I understand this is NOT authentic Mexican food but it's like 10 steps up from going to Chevy's)  I had a pineapple chipotle margarita.  The waitress warned me not to eat the full dried chipotle pepper because she'd seen it before and the results were not great.  I told her she didn't know me like that and took a bite out of mine.  Which I was fine, but really, I could see how that would end disastrously.

They had a mariachi band that came around and sang to people .  They were amazing!!!  They even sang "Let it Go" to a little girl who was wearing a Elsa t-shirt.  They sang Selena Quintanilla for me.

On the list of places to go next time I'm in Vegas!!!
