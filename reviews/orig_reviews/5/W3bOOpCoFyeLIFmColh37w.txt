I am from California so it has been a challenge for me to find the best mexican food in Charlotte. When I came to Cantina 1511, I have to say I found something that matched up pretty closely. 

I have been here twice and both times the staff have been so helpful, they are always there to offer suggestions and every time they have been correct. 

I have gotten the margarita sampler and that was really good. The blood orange one was delicious. 

The guacamole is really fresh and tasty. I like my guacamole spicy and it wasn't really spicy but I am sure if you ask they will adjust it for you. 

They give you a salsa that is mildly spicy but they have a spicy one so if you like spicy food ask for the spicy one. You will not be disappointed. 

The food was delicious too, the first time I got cheese enchilada and I thought it was too cheesy (like way to cheesy) but the second time I got a veggie enchilada and it was much better. 

Overall, a great place to have great mexican food in Charlotte.
