This place is fun! Whether it's karaoke night with Felix or just a random weekend, I am always down to party at the cantina. My friends from work frequent this place. We commonly and affectionately refer to it as "cantina" or "tina". The food is so good and portions are filling. My favorite dish is the shrimp tacos (i can't get enough of that spicy sauce) or the carne asada. Also, the wait staff, especially bartenders Sean and JB make the place feel like home. I hadn't come through in about six months and they still remembered me and the fact that I like to start out with a Shirley Temple before stuff gets crazy. Paradise Cantina is my favorite, even though it seems the owner is a Cleveland Browns fan. ;) Thanks cantina crew for providing me with a place to unwind.
