Read the reviews here on yelp and decided to give it a try.  So glad we did!  I am born and raised in Texas and we know our Mexican food.  When we first walked in we were a little skeptical but as soon as we received our food we were completely sold!  Not only is it SUPER cheap, but the food is amazing!  The spicy pork tacos were delish!  The spicy pork quesadilla was amazing too!  First time I've ever had a quesadilla where the bottom layer was a soft tortilla and the top was crunchy.  Then the fries!  Wow!  I only got a half order and it fed 3 peeps and we had to stuff ourselves to finish them.  So we had 3 people with sodas that ate until we waddled out for $20...WHAT?!!!  Can you say fat and happy???  YUP! = )
