I'm glad that Viva Mercado's took another shot! My wife and I used to go to the Flamingo/Jones location at least once per month. When they moved to Rainbow/Spring Mountain, it seemed as if the quality of the food and service went downhill. We took our business to competitors like Lindo.    We gave the new location in Village Square a shot and were pleasantly surprised. Chips tasted fresh and entrees were superb. I had the carnitas fajitas and my wife had a carne asada dish. Prices were in line with the quality and portions. I actually felt the value. Thanks Viva Mercado's for not giving up on keeping great Mexican food alive in Vegas.
