I'm always trying to introduce my friends to this very unique establishment. Always getting positive feedback.

I liked this place already from the tacos and burritos that I would usually get. This time I opted for the bulgogi w/ lettuce wrap and the GHETTO STYLE RAMEN!!! I CAN'T STOP THINKING ABOUT THESE TWO ITEMS!!! 

The bulgogi sitting on tortillas were really good when I first tried them. You can definately taste the successful fusion between these two great cultures. I was missing something though. I love the crunchy texture that you get from a lettuce wrap and daikon when eating bulgogi. The crunchy texture of the lettuce wrap, the sweet flavor of their bulgogi, and all the other makings burnt an everlasting impression into my taste buds. FOR SHEEZIE!!! I absolutely HEART this place now! :D

As for the GHETTO STYLE RAMEN?... What? Yallz want to go to that "other" spot for some ramen? I'm going to KoMex for some AWESOME GHETTO STYLE RAMEN!!! The weather is getting chilly to an uncomfortable cold now. This is perfect for this weather. I'm not even going to tell you what's in it. GHETTO STYLE RAMEN ALL DAY SUN!!! 

Thanks KoMex
