I can't believe all you crazies giving this place 1 star. This is the best TexMex in the East Valley. It's got a great anti-Tempe vibe right in the heart of Tempe, and that's really refreshing. Plus, the food is ace. Who cares if the service is lame? They bring me my food and drinks and an endless supply of chips and salsa, so I can't complain. Those it's mostly ASU kids manning the tables, it's not an ASU-heavy crowd. It's eclectic and has a great tiny bar when full. 

The patio scene is one of the better spots in Tempe. I love it when it's a bit chilly outside and they have the fire going. You're right on University, but you feel like you're in your own special nook. 

Don't skimp on the food. They use organic veggies and farm-raised meat, and it shows. I'm a sucker for the Steak Ranchero, but I've had at least half of the menu at one time or another, and I've never had a disappointing meal. And the margaritas are top notch. Where else can you find a friggin' tamarind margarita? C'mon people. Head in for happy hour and thank me later.
