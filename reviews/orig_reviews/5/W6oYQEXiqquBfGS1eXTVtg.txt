This is the BEST Mexican food that I've eaten in Phoenix!  As a newcomer, they insisted that I try samples of all of their taco fillings.  Everything was muy sabroso-- intensely flavored, fresh, and a great change of pace from the usual fare.  Freshly made guacamole, your choice of toppings, and great tortillas!  Five street tacos are $7.50, and a great way to try several of the fillings. You don't need the salsas-- the seasonings are that rich!  
Try the horchata--fresh, and more flavorful than I've ever had!  The "small" size is 20 oz, and worth every penny.  
You've got to try this gem if you're ready to send your taste buds on an adventure!  The Mexican wrestling decor is a lot of fun, too.  The staff will make you feel welcome!
