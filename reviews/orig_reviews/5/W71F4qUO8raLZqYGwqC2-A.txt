clean, spacious, easy parking, super friendly and accommodating service (takes reservations), food is amazing and portions are really generous! i reserved a table for 8 and when we arrived they had placed the 2 salsas plus awesome bean dips to be shared between 2 people and kept on offering refills on their freshly made chips. (grilled onions and jalapenos were also provided.) while it did take a little time for the food to arrive we had fun enjoying the atmosphere and the kids liked watching them make fresh tortillas. we of course ordered a flaming fajita plate, which was impressive and delicious but the rest of us couldn't resist ordering from the happy hour menu, which was impressively inexpensive and incredibly filling (maybe partly because you can almost eat your entire dinner with the bean and salsa dips?). they also provide complimentary soup, which is like a tomato-based soup with rice (the kids loved it), and we all left with to-go boxes! they do have tv's all around tuned into sports if that's something that you're into but a slight draw-back since we had young kids and a couple of the tv's were showing a pretty graphic boxing match. 

i'd definitely come here again and if we were locals we'd probably be regulars!
