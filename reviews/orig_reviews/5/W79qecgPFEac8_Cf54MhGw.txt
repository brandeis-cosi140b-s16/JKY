Oh wow I am super surprised this place only have a few reviews. This place is always packed with a line from it being so popular. CHARLIE"S TACO STAND!!

These are the BEST tacos I have had since I moved to Phoenix. I dont know how to explain how great they are. They meat is finely chopped up on top of a palm tree trunk which I am not sure if it give it a flavor to the meat but I think it does. The menu is simple only chicken and carne asada tacos for $1 (super cheap) and the have burritos and a few other items but the tacos I believe are the best!!!
