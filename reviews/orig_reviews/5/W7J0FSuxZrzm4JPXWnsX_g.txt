Loved this place! We had lunch today and it was a little pricey, but the servings were huge: more than we could eat. Service was top-notch. Both our waiter and the host (and possibly manager) were terrific and had a great sense of humor. Also loved the ambiance and decor. The food was good, but the margaritas were great. Definitely will return.
