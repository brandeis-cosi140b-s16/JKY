Possibly the best Mexican food in Vegas! I don't know how anyone could give Phat Phranks less than 4 stars. 

The adobada torta is seriously amazing. I am not much of a pork fan, but wow! The service was great as well.  We were not the easiest customers, but the staff was extremely kind and helpful. They really treated us like family. I love supporting a local family-owned business and this place has definitely made it into my family's routine. They do get busy during lunch hour, so be prepared for a bit of a wait. (or call ahead!) **tells you just how good they are! ** 

Give Phat Phranks a try, you won't regret it!!
