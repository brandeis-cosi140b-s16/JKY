Great first visit!  I'll try again soon and we'll see if they can keep the 5 star rating.  I have to say, I'm loving this corner of Frank Lloyd and Via Linda - several great options (Anacala, with Pars, Tesoro, etc).  I've avoided this place until now (2 yrs in the neighborhood) because it looks awful from the outside - like a sports bar or cheesy diner with those stark blue signs in the windows - whatever it looks like, it does NOT look like the cosy place it is! 

We sat outside on a 90+ evening, it was 'just right' - without annoying dripping misters. The live music from inside was actually great (not too loud, not intrusive, recognizable songs sung well - what I want from live music in a restaurant!). Even though we sat outside, the inside looked VERY inviting ... we'll see how cold it is (main reason I sit outside is that inside, restaurants are too cold in summer). 

The lobster queso appetizer was great (but too filling).  My partner had the salmon, and she loved it. I had a steak, and it was more tender than I could have hoped for ... can't quite explain that one but it was good!  Both my partner and I were served a large chili stuffed with potato - it was truly outstanding!!!

Will definitely be back. Only downside was that they allow smoking on the patio; luckily this visit there was no wind so the smokers in the corner were not noticeable ... but that will lose a star or two for sure if I end up next to a smoking table!
