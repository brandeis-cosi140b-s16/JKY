I recently revisited Mi Patio, after having been introduced several years ago by my sister, and then forgetting about it almost entirely until I had a recent date who said she enjoyed Mexican food. Mi Patio happened to be close to another one of our destinations that evening, so it fit perfectly into my plans. After reading the reviews here beforehand, I decided to give the Baja Chicken Burro a try, and I must say, I will NEVER forget Mi Patio again. This thing was so delicious that it sometimes haunts me in my dreams! Seriously, it's THAT good. The chips and salsa were pretty decent, albeit a little heavy on the cilantro. Good food, fair prices, definitely worth a try if you haven't been there yet.
