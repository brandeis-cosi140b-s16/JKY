So good! We went for the first time tonight. Between us, we had a cheese quesadilla, veggie tacos, a mini chicken taco, a carnitas burrito, beans, chips with salsa and watermelon aqua fresca.

Everything was delicious and fresh. It's like Los Tacos, but better! Also the restaurant is clean and newly refurbished. My son and husband both enjoyed it and we will be back.
