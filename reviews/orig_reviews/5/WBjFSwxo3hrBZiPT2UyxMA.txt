I love going here for happy hour! Great small plates that are very filling. Love their Ceviche Tacos! $3-$7 for everything on the happy hour menu and a good selection. When we were seated today they asked us if we had been there before, when we told them we had they sent us 2 complimentary tacos to thank us for our repeat business. Great customer service!!! Will definitely dine here anytime I'm at the forum shoppes again!
