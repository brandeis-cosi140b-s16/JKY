Why didn't I know about this place?? My Daughter and I decided to check it out when we had a rare night to ourselves and so glad we did! We had the crab cakes for an appetizer and they were just delicious and could have been a meal in themselves. The waitress said the magic "L" word(lobster) as a special so I had the lobster tacos. Yummy yummy yummy! Prices are reasonable and I like that the patio is in back, not out on busy Gilbert Road. We will definitely be there again and again!!
