We enjoyed a phenomenal Christmas Eve dinner this year at Rokerij. We had a larger party (16) so we used the private room they have behind the bar. It was fantastic. Shannon and Paul were fantastic while we set this up and the night couldn't have been better. Tony did a great job with such a large group. Of course, the food is just crazy good.... The "Rokerij" side of the menu is traditional American fare while the "Richardson's" side of the menu is New Mexico-style Mexican food (WONDERFUL if you like spicy). Typical Rokerij, they also had about 10 specials (veal chops were great, salmon and grouper were perfect), plus everything ordered from the menu was wonderful (except the prime rib sliders were way over-cooked and bland). We highly recommend... Thanks Rokerij for a great night.
