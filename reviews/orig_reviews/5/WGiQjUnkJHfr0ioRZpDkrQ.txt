This is my FAVORITE Restaurant in Las Vegas.  My boyfriend and I came across it by accident as we were heading to the Shark Reef.  The food is fabulous and has such an array of different flavors.  The enchiladas and the carne asada quesadilla are to DIE for not to mention the watermelon lemonade!

The service is fabulous and is located near the Shark Reef, away from all the hussle and bussle of the casino...and it is close by the pool as well.  Give this place a try, you won't be disappointed!
