This is the Very first Macayo's. Always good food!
 We love the chips and salsa, especially with a good cup of coffee!

The food is always good, we are not much of drinkers but, we hear the drinks are strong and good.
You can order almost anything you want. Even if it is not on the menu. 
Their BaJA Sause is fantastic! Lots of really good choices. 
If you are craving Mexican this is the place.
