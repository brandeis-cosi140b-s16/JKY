I have always been a fan of all three of Riachardson's restaurants Rokerij, Dick's Hideaway and Richardson's Cuisine.

I was sad to hear that Richardson's Cuisine burnt down, so I started going to the Rokerij more and I still love it!

If you love good high alcohol beer on tap, they are one of the few restaurants who carry Chimay on tap!  

Always a great place to be even when it is busy and have to wait for a seat, we were there when the Suns swept the Spurs a couple weeks ago and the bartenders are very attentive despite being busy.  

I wish I lived in the neighborhood behind the Rokerij I would be there every night!
