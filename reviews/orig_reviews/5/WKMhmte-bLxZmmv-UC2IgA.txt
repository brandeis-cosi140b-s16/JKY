Super chic restaurant! I love the interior of the restaurant. A few of my girlfriends and I decided to check this place out before a meeting. I'm so happy we did because the food is pretty amazing. It's not your typical Mexican restaurant. All the dishes had a unique twist to it. The sauces on the dishes were so good. They also give you complimentary chips and salsa.  The entrees however do not come with sides like rice or beans. You have to order that separate. 
Make sure to check in so you can get 10% off one entree per table!!
