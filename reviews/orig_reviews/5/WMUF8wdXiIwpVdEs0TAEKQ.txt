Los Reyes is too awesome. first we went i had the Plato de Alambre de Camaron which is the grilled shrimp plate,and the Coctel de Cameron 'grande"..  which is a large shrimp cocktail. soooo good i had to go back 2 days later and had the shrimp cocktail again and a grilled steack and onion burro. my girlfriend had a chicken torta. 
it was hella good!!!! next time i go gonna try the tacos......
