This place is doing something right for sure!  I have been here for breakkfast, lunch and dinner...I have also been here for a last minute bday dinner and for night caps that have turned into a bit more than that....thank you Brian and Terry!  These guys can turn the joint inside out everynow and again....if you catch them on one of these evenings your bound to have a drink or two poured in your direction.

This place is quiet eclectic if you walk around for a look see....There is a  piece of framed art in the far back corner that Brian's  (an owner) mother painted. There is a round table with claw legs under a chandelier that came from Brians mom's house and I would guess once stood at the base of double spiral staircase in the foyer of a large plantation-like home.  The candles,chandeliers, communal table, outside fireplace and courtyard make for great ambiance...

The Mission has not let me down yet....The food, be it breakfast lunch or dinner has always been as friendly as the staff and as eclectic as the ambiance.  Kobi Beef hot dog wrapped in bacon with beans on the side.  
Halibut tacos.  There is a dish (cant recall what its called) that has peanut butter in it...OBVIOUSLY do not order if you have allergic reactions to peanut butter....but, let me tell you, if you're kool with p-but, order this dish!!!  O, you also have to like pork.

Afterwards if ur feeling guilty for all the extravagant food and drink, u can always walk on into church and confess.....(right next door).

And tell them I sent you....NOT the priest,...tell Brian I sent you and that you want a drink on the house (let him know the power of YELP.
