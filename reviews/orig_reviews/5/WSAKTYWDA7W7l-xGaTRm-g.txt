I love this place! My fiance And I go here atleast once a week. The portions are huge! Food is amazing. I love their carne asada. They have great lunch specials... Leticia is super nice and cares about what you think of her restaurant. You have to try their cheese enchiladas too the sauce is different And amazing!!!
