After reading such great reviews on yelp, I've been wanting to try this place! My first attempt was a disappointment because I showed up at around 5:45pm on a Sunday and it was closed. Although frustrated, I couldn't get too upset since it is a one man show and I'm sure he'd like to get home to his family at some point. 
My next attempt was around 7pm on a Tuesday evening. Ordered food to go for the entire family and sat and waited for it with my oldest son. 

Was super impressed by the process this gentleman has making all of the food. After cooking the meat and filling two carne asada tacos, he added more to the grill and stuffed those tacos to the gill!! My oldest son who refuses to eat carnitas from any place but home, ordered two mini carnitas tacos and absolutely loved them!! 

Overall the entire family loved what they ordered. It's cheaper than a Don Tor Taco or Roberto's and the food is so much better! We will definitely be returning to help support this gentleman's business and enjoy some delicious homemade Mexican food!
