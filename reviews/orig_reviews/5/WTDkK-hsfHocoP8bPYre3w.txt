I absolutely love this new restaurant! Went here for the first time for a Christmas party and it was love from first sight and taste . 
Im spoiled by a great variety of Russian restaurants in Los Angeles and was greatly missing Russian food. So finally one opened in Vegas! Green Dacha offers a variety of Russian and Mediterranean dishes. Among my favorite main course dishes are Borscht, Beef Stroganoff, Chiken Kiev, and Pork Chops. They also offer a wide variety of traditional Russian appetizers and deserts.
The staff is super friendly and attentive providing a great service. The prices are reasonable and the servings are generous. The venue is casual, but could be dressed up for a special occasion
I'm yet to try their hookah as I've heard it was great.
I've already become a regular and would most  definitely recommend to try it!
