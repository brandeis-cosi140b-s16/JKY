First time here at The Linq and decided to check out Chayo. The table side guac made by Henry was phenomenal and he was very nice to ask if we wanted each ingredient before he mixed it in.  The chopped salad was huge and amazing and my friend had the Mahi Mahi tacos and loved them.  Our waitress Patty was just in a league of her own! She brought me a pitcher of Arnold Palmer because she saw how thirsty I was in this 107 degree heat and I couldn't be any happier! The place looks amazing as well and huge Tequila selection!  Also great mix of music!
