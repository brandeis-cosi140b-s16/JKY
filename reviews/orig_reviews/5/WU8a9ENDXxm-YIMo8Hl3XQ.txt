You have to get the Red Chile & Mango Steak salad here! It is so delicious and the best part is the salad is huge and I always have leftovers for the next day. It is definitely spicy so only get it if you like a nice kick. Also I recommend coming here for Easter Brunch! My family has been going for years now and they have there bloody mary/mimosa bar and it's a great price or if you really want to get a buzz get the Chambord margarita. It's frozen and you can't have more than 4 because it's that strong haha I highly recommend
