I grew up in Las Cruces and Albuquerque, New Mexico. My grandmother's cooking is very difficult to beat!! Chile Addiction was pretty close to my grandmother's authentic New Mexico cooking. My wife and I drove in from California (on our way to a weeks vacation) just to try some New Mexico cooking!! I had the stuffed sopapilla smothered in red chile. It was really good. It was also a lot of food!! I took half of it home and had it for dinner the next night. You have to try the "Chile con Queso" appetizer. It was excellent. My wife had a green chile enchilada, complete with an egg on top. She loved it!! We finished off our dinner with a basket of sopapilllas. My wife loves honey on hers, I like mine plain. Yummy!!! 

8 days later on our way home from vacation, we stopped in for our second meal. I had the stacked red chile enchiladas, complete with the egg on top. Wow!!! It was just as good as grandma's!! My wife had the stuffed sopapilla smothered in red chile. She loved it!! We also had the "Chile con Queso" again as an appetizer. It was just as good as it was the first time we had it. We left the restaurant stuffed!!!! However,we took some extra sopapillas with us!! I highly recommend "Chile Addiction" and we are now loyal customers, even though it is a four hour drive from our home. We will come in each time we come to Vegas!!! The owners, Amy and Paul, are very nice people. They are very concerned their customers are happy. We are happy!!

Oh yeah, I almost forgot. Our waiter, Robert, worked very hard making sure we had everything we needed throughout our meals. He was very patient while we were ordering (there were so many great things to eat on the menu, we were having issues deciding what we wanted). He was our server on our second visit too. Great owners, great staff, and great food. It has everything to make our New Mexico experience, away from New Mexico, authentic and delicious!!
