You've had chilaquiles before.....lumpy corn tortillas mixed with eggs and cheese.  You won't get them at Otro. Otro's are light, layered with shredded chicken and cheese but the sauce is the best part. I would have drunk it from the bowl. Great breakfast, lunch or dinner with an Inca salad. Prices are reasonable, friendly atmosphere.
