What a lovely meal! I started with the queso fundido app with chorizo and it was fantastic. However the grilled mahi tacos take the cake; the fish was tender and the veggies diced and seasoned to perfection. The mole over pollo is so complex I can't fathom how many chillies and how much time and love went into this. The staff is friendly and Chef Paco was kind enough to come by and personally share some of that love from the kitchen with us. I can't wait to come back for happy hour next time or locals night (Mondays).
