Came in last night for a late night snack and a night cap. Sat at the bar and our bartender was attentive, made great margaritas, and encouraged our food choices. 

Two stand out moments that will make me take my friends when they visit: 
1) the bar plays what I call the Pandora of music videos. Such a great variety. 
2) One of the kitchen staff was finished and sitting at the bar. He befriended a regular (I think) and bought him a shrimp taco to try since the gentleman never had one. That's the type of cool and friendly vibe I think runs throughout this location. 

I can't wait to go back and have a full on meal. Also, they have a wide variety of tequila and THANK GOODNESS no slot machines at the bar.
