Moving away from California had me longing for good authentic tacos. 9 months had passed and I couldn't find a decent taco spot in Vegas that made killer tacos that were similar to my grandmas. Then one drunken night, my boyfriend decided to take me here after we went clubbing. 
Let's get one thing clear, this place isn't fancy by any means. Nor does it offer great decor BUT what you get here are authentic hand made tortillas, delicious flavorful salsas and quality meats.
I had the Tacos al pastor with everything and added pineapple and practically swallowed them. I've been here a few times ever since and each time I've gone there's been a wait time of at least 15-20 mins to order food. The 3 separate lines make it pretty difficult to maneuver around when you have a tray full of food but it's nothing that's too bad or out of the ordinary.  Definitely my favorite spot for tacos and horchata!
