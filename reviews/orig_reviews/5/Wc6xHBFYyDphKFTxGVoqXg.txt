This place is the shit - so much so that I'm willing to take the light rail all the way from midtown to partake of its delicious drinks and food. 

Happy hour runs every night of the week, including Saturdays and Sundays, from 4-6:30 and it's one of the best HHs in Phoenix, in my opinion (and I thought that before Phoenix Magazine rated it as such). You can get 50% of house margaritas (quite large and decently strong), bottled/draft beer, premium well drinks and all tequilas. Plus, select food items, including some of the best vegetarian tacos I've ever had, are also 50% off. Those mushroom tacos with roasted blue cheese make any reasonable person not miss meat and have a very complex and sophisticated flavor profile. 

The cool indoor/outdoor vibe is the icing on the cake and makes this a perfect place for Phoenix day drinking. Take the light rail there, get drunk and soak up the rays. You won't regret it.
