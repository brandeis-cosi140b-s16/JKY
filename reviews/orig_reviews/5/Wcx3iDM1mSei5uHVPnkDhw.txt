I was in Vegas for the weekend, looked up food spots on yelp an Tacos El Gordo came up. Decided to give it a try, it was about a 15 min drive from MGM. I got there about 11pm an the place was packed, it was a Monday night. They actually have 3 different lines for ordering food, it depends on the kind of meat you want, that is a little weird but ok. Anyway the food was great, specifically the tacos, I usually order a carne asada burrito but they don't have that option, what???? I should drop a star just for that but I won't. The tacos turned out to have great flavor an were a good size. I even ordered 4 more to go for later on that night in the room. They keep the place clean, the price is ok, I just wish they had burritos, still I will definitely make a return trip on my next visit to Vegas. TACOS ARE PRETTY BOMB.
