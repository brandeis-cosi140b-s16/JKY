I have been here a few times. Was raining like crazy when i last went.  But, the place was still packed. We love it! The food is so very good.     We had a bit of a wait but, it is well worth it.   Staff is friendly and the Decor is very Mexico looking, which is great!  Lots of parking outside in the lot and you can even eat outside when it is not raining.
