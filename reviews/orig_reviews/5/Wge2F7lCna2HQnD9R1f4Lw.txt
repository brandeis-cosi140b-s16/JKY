Diablo's Cantina was a hell of a good time!  We stopped in at lunchtime and sat at the bar for a quick drink (that turned into two) and had we not had to leave for the the airport, could easily have spent the whole day at the bar!  Our server, Desi, was great and was happy to share the fantastic drink recipes.  Try the Freida Kahlo or the (sorry, can't remember the name) but the jalapeno tequila mojito.  Can't wait to make a couple of pitchers of these poolside come summer!  In lieu of a meal, we opted to share several appetizers.  I am an avocado junkie and the chunky guacomole, served in an ice cold mortar, and house made tortilla chips, were beyond description--trust me, just order it!  The taquitos were good too, smoky and the pork and chicken filling smoky and freshly prepared.  Our only regret at Diablo's was that we didn't discover it sooner!
