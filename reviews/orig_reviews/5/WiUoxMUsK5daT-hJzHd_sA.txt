Okay, I know Las Vegas is not Bay Area, BUT, if you go to Las Vegas (who doesn't) and you don't go to El Dorado Cantina, you have missed a great experience.  Best street taco's I have ever had. Really good Tequila selection and prices that are really good. On industrial road not far from Treasure Island. Veggie dishes, awesome pork, beef and chicken, AND do yourself a favor and get the Flan. Chef Paco's grandmothers recipe. I love good tequila and good carnitas and carne asada tacos. You won't be disappointed.
Enrique was our gracious server and Chef Paco came out to welcome us.
Go there.
