One of the first things I said about this place when I came here is that it seemed just like a taco stand in Mexico. It's super small with just about 15 bar style seats in the place. All it needs is to be completely outside, and that's as authentic as it gets!

My partner got the tacos al pastor and said they were just as goods as ones we had in Mexico. I opted for the potato flautas and they were pretty good as well. They came on a full plate with rice, beans, pico de gallo, and guac and I'm not gonna lie, it's a lot of food, but its perfect. I wasn't a huge fan of the rice, but I'm really picky when it comes to Mexican rice. I did like the potato chunks in it though. 

You get chips and salsa set in front of you almost the minute you sit down (if you're lucky enough to get a seat), the food comes out ridiculously fast, and it's good authentic Mexican food. I will definitely go back whenever I'm in town.
