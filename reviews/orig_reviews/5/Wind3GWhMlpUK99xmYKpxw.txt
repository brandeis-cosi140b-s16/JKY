Recession proof...

Mothers come feed your kids, I'm unsure of the nutritional value but as it comes from hippies it should looks healthy, this place has serious value, friendly employees and in my case owner.  I was steered towards the 3 pack and cheese crisp, which were both fantastic.  The cheese crisp is more like a quesadilla and enough to feed 2.  I'll be back many more times.
