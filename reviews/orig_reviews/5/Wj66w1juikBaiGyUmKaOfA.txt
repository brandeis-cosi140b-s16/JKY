Whoa, just had this place for the 3rd time...  Hard to beat the flavor of their carne asada - not sure if it's their marinade or the fact that's it's grilled, but it's unbelievable.  Everything I've had here is good.  My only constructive feedback is the salsa is kind of weak, but that's not keeping me from coming back.  Highly recommend...
