Great for gluten free eaters!! They don't have a gluten free menu, but are very knowledgable and accommodating. There are many menu options and they understand cross contamination! If you call ahead they will make sure you have gluten free chips for you too. Great food and good service! I have celiac disease and felt very safe eating there.
