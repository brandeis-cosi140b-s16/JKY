This is a review for all the Mad Mex chains. There's a Biggie quote in there somewhere...This is a shout out to all the people who thought i'd never amount to nothin'. Mad Mex stands on its own. It does not need reviews because it is so completely amazing. It's like Nirvana when I open the front door. The tequila flights are heaven. The burritos and wings are top notch. I don't even have to review the big azz margs. Just know they're out of this world if you haven't tried one yet. The decor is bitchin. So are the skelly's in the restroom. The menu is really fun to read. Just like my reviews. I want lights like they have. You know, the green ones in the jelly jars hanging on ropes? Yeah.
