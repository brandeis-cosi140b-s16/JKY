I meet my in-laws in Wickenburg when my 2rd old princess goes to visit them in Kingman. We've met for breakfast at the Horseshoe Cafe(check out my review), but this time we decided to do lunch. I had read the past reviews for El Ranchero, so we decided to try it out. 

DELISH! Simple Mexican home-cooking is the best way to describe this place. All the ingredients were fresh and cooked perfectly. My husband had their taco salad with chicken. What they brought out was not what we were expecting. It was a taco shell in the shape of a pie crust (genius!), homemade guacamole, sour cream, the usual salad stuff, and chunks, I mean chunks, of tender, juicy chicken breast. The chicken was falling apart and it just melted in your mouth. Yum!

I had their veggie burrito. All fresh ingredients and just enough to fill you for the 1 hour drive back to Mesa. My 2yr old had their chicken nuggets with beans. She loves it. Their beans are great, especially with tortilla chips, her fave. Their salsa is also fresh and good. 

We've now made this place our Wickenburg child-exchange location. haha. Can't wait to go back.
