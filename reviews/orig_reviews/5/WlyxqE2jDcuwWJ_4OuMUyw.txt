Sabor is my new favorite place in Charlotte. I discovered it a few months ago and have eaten here countless times since. Everything I've tried is absolutely delicious. I find my self craving an arepa from here at least once a week. In addition to awesome food they also have a salsa bar and great beer. If you love authentic Latin American cuisine I could not recommend this place more! Even if you don't love it, I'd still recommend Sabor -- they will probably change your mind.
