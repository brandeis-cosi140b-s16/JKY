We love it! Stopped in for lunch today after golf and were seated immediately.  Drinks arrived promptly, along with chips, red & green salsa and bean dip. All delicious and fresh. I had the fiesta burro & my bf ordered the pick two. Scrumptious! We were very impressed. We have no complaints, and it is clear they all take pride in this restaurant.
