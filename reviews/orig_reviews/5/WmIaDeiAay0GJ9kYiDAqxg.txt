Hold up, Wait . a . minute. Amazing Legit Tacos for $2 each , RIGHT ON THE STRIP?! Yep, that's right. Right by Encore, just a few steps from the taxi waiting area.... you'll find a plaza chock-full of eateries, including Tacos El Gordo. 

My friends and I tried the Carne Asada and the Pork Adobada (Spicy Pork) tacos, and we were not dissapointed. On a hot day in Vegas, the refreshing horchata helped too. The tacos are topped with this amazing green cream sauce, onions and salsa. It's so simple yet so AMAHHZING. and the homemade tortillas? perfect consistency. I'm definitely coming back here soon, and adding this to my "Vegas Diet" list. 

CAAA CHOOWW!
