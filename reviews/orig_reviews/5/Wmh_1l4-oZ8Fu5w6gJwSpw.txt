I ate at this location and the one in Gilbert while on a business trip to Phoenix. Both times were home runs! Service is spot on, ambiance is excellent (don't let the word hipster scare you!), and the food is fantastic. Our server at this location was Trevor and he was so great... helpful and personable! I would eat here every time I'm back in Phoenix! Get the brownie sundae... it will change your life!!
