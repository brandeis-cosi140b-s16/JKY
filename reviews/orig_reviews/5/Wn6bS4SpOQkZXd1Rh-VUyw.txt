I LOVE BORDER GRILL!!!

For years I've been wanting to check out brunch at Mandalay Bay, but never had the chance to and when it opened at Caesar's forum shops we had to stop by. For my birthday my husband and I went to Vegas and we stopped by border grill on a Saturday with our friends Saehee & Paul. 

Our server recommended that she would just bring out 4-5 plates at a time and continuously bring out plates as we finish up. We told her about Paul's corn allergy and she made sure to inform us when corn was used in the dish. She also would substitute flour tortillas for corn which was great.

We also got the bottomless mimosas and I loved every flavor they had to offer! (They had 5-6 flavors?) Out of everything we ate I enjoyed the egg white oysters rockefeller & the shrimp and grits the best. I would definitely come back! Highly recommended.
