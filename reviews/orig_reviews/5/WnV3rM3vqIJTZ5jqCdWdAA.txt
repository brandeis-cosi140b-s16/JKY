Great little place that you totally don't see coming! Chinese and Mexican? Uh. ..ok. That was my initial secondary thought. My initial primary thought was "Hungry we are. Prepare for intake of nutrients" (I talk like Yoda when I'm starving. I quite possibly could eat poop and not know when I'm at this level). However, this place is faaar and away from feces. Which according to the 3 star over all rating, you wouldn't guess to be the case. I'm happy to shut down the nay sayers and conclude that this place wins like Serena Williams. It was a grand slam baby. For a tapas spot, the portions were large!  

Everything was delicious, my favorite being the lamb pot stickers and the shrimp mojo. Awesome. I'm unsure why people are hating on this spot. Maybe the mix (mix, not fusion) of Chinese and Mexican are just to far out for some people and they are expecting dirt cheap, greasy, day old left overs tasting college dorm vittles; sorry amoeba brained douche bags... this place has class in their cuisine. #happynoshing
