Fish tacos,and beer. ..can't go wrong !!
Price ok,beer could have been free,,,

Anyway, I have been coming here since opening, food always good,bartenders on their game.
If you want your food quickly. ..go to the bar
Service down in the restaurant is always slow.
Free chips and salsa and drinks,free..ehm.. (complemementary) while you play.
