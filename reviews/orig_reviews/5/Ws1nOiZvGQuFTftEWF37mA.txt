This place has a great vibe and excellent service. It is a great place to go before enjoying a show at The Smith Center. 

The guava margarita is super tasty. The chicken fajitas are delicious and big enough to share. My husband loved the burger. 

The decor is unique and fun to look at. Can't wait to eat there again!
