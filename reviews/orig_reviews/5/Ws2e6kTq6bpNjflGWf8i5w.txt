The coolest spot in Scottsdale.  Food...service...atmosphere....pretty women...EVERYTHING was double great.

After too many cocktails...and too many very tasty entrees...our group left singing the praises of this new spot.

Fortunately, my wife and I were guests...and I would guess the host spent some money.  Whatever it cost was well worth it.  

Can;t wait to go back.
