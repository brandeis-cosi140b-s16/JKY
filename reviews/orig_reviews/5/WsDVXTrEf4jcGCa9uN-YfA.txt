This place is da bomb! Ate here in Nov. 2014... On a Sat night. Ambiance is super cool... We sat on the patio overlooking the pool. The service was fast and friendly, the food was incredible and the margaritas were expensive ($15) but GOOD! Order the bacon wrapped jalape√±os for appetizer!! Best I've ever had. Shrimp enchiladas were awesome and the chile relleno was super good. Lobster tacos were bland and disappointing. Guacamole was great and rolled tacos were yummy. Would definitely eat here again!! Oh and here's a tip: eat dinner here early! Line at hostess stand gets long after 6pm. Great place to eat before attending KISS concert!! Or any concert at the HRH!! Good job peeps!!
