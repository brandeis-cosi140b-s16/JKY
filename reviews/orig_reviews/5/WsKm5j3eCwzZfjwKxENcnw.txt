On a recent business trip to Phoenix, this was the highlight of the trip.  I had watched We Live Here on the Fine Living Network and Phoenix was featured.  This was one of the three places on the show and the standout for me.  We came here on our second night in town and was tempted to return on the third night too.  Thanks to the hotel bell-hop/valet we started with the guacamole which is made table-side (nothing new I know) but it came with pomegranate seeds.  They totally worked.  Also, the chips were round small tortillas about 4 times the size of a typical tortilla triangle.  Very tasty!

For my main meal I went with the daily special which was fillet Mignon stuffed with crab.  YUM!  Oh and before I forget, I also had the house margarita which was one of the best I have ever had and the sangria that has Jack Daniels in it.  It totally worked for me!

For dessert we ordered the vanilla crepe but the last one was given to an adjacent table so instead they brought us hot churros with yummy ice cream.  It totally hit the spot.

If I went back again I would try the slow cooked pork.  Oh and a local told me that they have a fabulous brunch too.

Go there!  It is a must in Phoenix!
