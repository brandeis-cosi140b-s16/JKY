What a harmonious symphony of flavors!! Who knew that Korean and Mexican flavors could blend in such a way that would make my taste buds sing. The bulogi meat is perfectly marinated and has such an awesome flavor- you can go wrong ordering it in the taco, burrito, nachos... just pile it on high!
The bulogi tacos: loaded with the marinated Korean meat, super fresh and delicious. Just squeeze some lime over it and the flavors speak for themselves. Two tacos is a pretty good portion- espcially if you plan on ordering the nachos too. 
Bulogi nachos: everything nachos could be and beyond. The chips were thick enough to withstand the meat and the thick mozzarella cheese, but they were still super crispy and very addictive. The bulogi meat paired perfectly with the hot sauce in a way that you'll be licking your fingers clean. My only complaint is that the mozzarella cheese gets cold too fast- however I think that's a common problem with all nachos
Cheesesteak: my husband order this monster of a sandwich- you almost need a fork and a knife to enjoy it. The bulogi meat has a more subtle flavor in this dish, but it works well for the cheesestake sandwich. The fries were a little bland and not my favorite- but who cares with all the other knock out dishes. 
To quench your thirst- try their passion iced tea. Perfect on a hot Vegas summer day
