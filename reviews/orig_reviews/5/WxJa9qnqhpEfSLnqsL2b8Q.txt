This is definitely my favorite Mexican restaraunt in Las Vegas!

They have a bunch of different delicious salsas to choose from which is great for me because I love really spicy food but my wife likes basic Pico De Gallo!  I got some kind of burrito there and let me tell you this....I don't normally like Mexican but I was attempting to lick the plate clean.

There maragaritas are also HUGE (my had to give me the last half of hers and drive home).  They also have a guy that plays live guitar music and seems to know every song known to man.

I never rate anything 5 stars.

Do  yourself a favor.....go here.
