OMG...I have been going here with my famiy since I was very very young!  I love this please!  They have these shrimp dumplings that are brought out in this skillet with this amazing sauce!! OMG i love it!!  The Chambord margarita is a must here!  It is an amazing frozen margarita and they are just better and better everytime!
  I am not a fish person, but their fish tacos are delicious and they are different.  My favorite item that I get almost everytime is the jerk chicken salad!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Everyone should try this and they will die and go to heaven.  Then you should try the cobbler at the end!  It is sinfully delicious dessert that changes with the season but the peach and berry is my favorite!  It comes with ice cream of course...

Do not forget to eat the cornbread that they bring you it is hot and moist and with the butter it is great!  You might even want to fill up on it but dont because you will miss out on dinner and dessert!  I love this place!  I always will and it has a special place in my heart!
