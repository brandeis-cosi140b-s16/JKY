I just want to add, that since becoming vegan, this is my go to spot for a damn good burrito!  The tortillas are vegan as are the beans, thanks for not using lard peeps!!  Get a bean burrito Terry's way! You'll thank me for this later!  Plus, the regular, tamarindo or jamaica margarita's are all to die for!
