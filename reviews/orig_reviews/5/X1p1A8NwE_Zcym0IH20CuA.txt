This place is scrumptious. I've really never strayed away from the vegetarian chilaquiles (which are pure heaven), but I've tasted all of my friends' choices and everything has been mouth watering. They've also got delicious sangria and and other drinks as well, not to mention the restaurant venue is lovely and the service is wonderful!
