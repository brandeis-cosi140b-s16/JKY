Pretty shocked this place only has 3.5 stars as it's one of my all-time favorites in the Valley. 

Family owned, HOT AS HELLLLLL salsa, strong margs, and a solid menu. I demand a visit to Los Dos every single time I am home. I dream about the absurdly spicy salsa, washed down with an absurdly large margarita on the rocks. Chile rellanos are super good, as is the spicy shrimp. Their puerco dishes are also amazing. Adovado burro what what. 

Sometimes, it can be a wait for the food (I'm looking at you Friday nights), but why would you care? You have endless chips and salsa to devour + that huge ass margarita to work on. The atmosphere is fun too, lively, loud, families enjoying deliciousness. 

Do not come here if you can't handle the heat.
