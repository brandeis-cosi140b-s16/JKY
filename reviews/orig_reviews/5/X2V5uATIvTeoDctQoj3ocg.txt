Had a wonderful lunch, attentive wait staff and nice crowd in the bar. Here for the Rock'n'Roll Marathon & Half and the food was an authentic experience. Very much loved that they have the organic Tequila Casa Noble one of the smoothest around. Good time here! House made tortilla chips and guacamole was fantastic among other entrees. Can't go wrong with their menu.
