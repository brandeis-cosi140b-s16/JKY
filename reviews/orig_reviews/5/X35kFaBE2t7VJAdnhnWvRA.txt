What a wonderful spot! Did a little yelp search after a Royals spring training game and came upon this gem of a place! Not only is the food delicious, but the owner, Richie, is a interesting and charming man. He truly cares about his customers experience and does what he can to improve upon it as best he can. Too bad I live in New York, cause this would definitely become a regular spot for me. Next time I am down for spring training this will be one of my first stops!
