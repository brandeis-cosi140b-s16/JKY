We were in Mesa for the weekend for a friend's wedding and were staying within walking distance of the downtown area. Contrary to LA, everything is apparently closed on Sundays in Arizona so our dining options seemed limited. Being in the mood for enchiladas, we gave Blue Adobe a try with low expectations, having been somewhat disappointed with the food in the area the previous day. I actually remembered walking by Blue Adobe the day before and thinking that it looked like a place I wouldn't be interested in. Blacked out windows, an aging exterior...it just didn't look like the kind of place that had good food to me. But again, options being limited on Sundays...

The cliche is to not judge a book by it's cover, and it holds true here. The decor inside is actually pretty nice and welcoming ... but you came here for the food. I had 2 cheese enchiladas, a beef taco, beans and rice and a margarita. Everything tasted incredible! The beans were way above average (which is a sentence I never expected to write in my lifetime). The rice had a smokey flavor that suggested that they were really MAKING their food, not just doing the same recipes everyone else does. The enchiladas were great and it was all in all a surprising and fantastic meal.

I'd probably have given Blue Adobe a strong 4 stars if it hadn't been for the great service from Allison to push it to 5. Infectious spirit, very attentive and helpful, and a joy to watch work the room. Any time a server delivers your margarita with, "I'm a terrible bartender because I like drinking too much. Prepare for tingles in about 10 minutes", then you definitely get another star.

Blue Adobe, I'll see you when next I'm back this way!
