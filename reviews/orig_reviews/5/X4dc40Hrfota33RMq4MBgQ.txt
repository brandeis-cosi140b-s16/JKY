I dare say my favorite fast burrito joint in town. Although I'm a big fan of Chipotle, I have never liked Phat Burrito or Moe's because they lack flavor and tender meat. My shredded chicken burrito had lots of great flavor, delicious meat, fresh salsas, creamy beans - it was really good. I will definitely be back.
