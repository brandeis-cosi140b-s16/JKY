This is a hidden gem. What you need to know is this is good typical of a particular state in Mexico- Puebla. Just like you find fried okra in CA, you find burritos here. These are region specific. And delicious in their own right. 
The mole is fantastic, the sopes are rich and delicious. And we enjoy the esquitos because then I don't have floss right after!
The owners are kind and humble.
