I love this place for a quick, healthy (I always get the fish machaca), and delicious lunch!  I load up on the different toppings and sauces and always feel good after eating here.  Reuben (the owner) is always there, and I fully support small businesses like this one and hope that it continues to be successful!

Keep it Up!
