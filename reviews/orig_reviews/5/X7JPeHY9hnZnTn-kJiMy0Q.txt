Best deal here you may ask yourself? The carne asada burrito special place. Inside this deliciously wrapped tortilla shell is the carne asada steak, pico, and guac. Absolutely heaven with every bite accompanied by their green or red hot sauce. Sides that come on the plate also include Mexican rice and refried beans. Both spectacular and delicious!!!!!! Ask for limes too when ordering. Fair prices all around
