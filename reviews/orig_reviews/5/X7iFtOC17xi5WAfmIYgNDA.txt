This restaurant has a very welcoming and casual atmosphere and the hostesses and waiters are very friendly. For starters, complimentary fresh fried tortilla chips are served with warm bean dip and red salsa or you can request for the spicier habanero salsa which I love. They also give you a complimentary small bowl of fideo soup to wet your appetite. For appetizers, we ordered the beef sopitos which were very juicy and delicious topped with guacamole and sour cream. If you checkin with your Yelp account, they give you a free margarita! I always end up getting full just from the the complimentary appetizers, so save room for the delicious entrees. 

For dinner we ordered the Carnitas Michoacanas and the Chicken Mole Poblano. The carnitas were cooked in spices and were very succulent and tasty. They are served with a green salsa and a spicy charred jalape√±o, yum! The chicken mole poblano was juicy and served smothered in a flavorful, mildly spicy and sweet brown mole sauce, so good! Both entrees are served with Mexican rice and warm beans topped with cheese. 
Also all of the entrees come with freshly made corn or flour tortillas that are warm and delicious. We always leave here stuffed, satisfied and with leftovers because the portions are huge!
