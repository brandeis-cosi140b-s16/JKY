I've been here for several shows and the sound is great. Also love that it is a fairly intimate venue. It's also not a bad idea to get to the show early to check out Cocina 10's happy hour for great deals on amazing food such as their fish tacos. Super nice employees. As an ASU student I can park for free with my permit in an ASU lot nearby.
