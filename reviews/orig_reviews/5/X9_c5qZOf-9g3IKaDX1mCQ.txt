Dropped somebody off at this shopping center and then dropped into Revo to sample the food at about 8pm. Not too crowded and at first the giant menu board is a bit overwhelming, especially since they start their list of burritos with Number 10-17. So, I'm like where is burrito's 1-9, but they don't exist just like Manti's girlfriend. Eventually decided on the Chicken Machacha tacos which were full of flavor and seasoned with spices, cilantro and then topped with some cheese and a great fresh pico de gallo blend. They weren't the biggest tacos ever, but were well stuffed and choose the crispy style if you want that true crunchy experience. At $9.95, I went for the combo, which is about right for this part of town I guess. The black beans with a hint of cheddar on top was excellent, but my favorite side was the creamy white rice with corn and peppers. Excellent chips rounded out the to-go order. Now, there are plenty of salsa choices and I tried the medium because they didn't put mild in the bag. That salsa had a chipotle kick, but at the last minute I added  a green chili salsa and that made all the difference with these tacos. Green chili sauce is the clear winner and that Revo breakfast burro is looking great next time.
