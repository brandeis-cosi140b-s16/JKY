Love at first bite! This is my first time and I was checking out to see if the kiddos would like it! I received the best customer service from the drive thru (Jeremy - I believe) he let
Me try samples and was super helpful!' I met the owner and was totally impressed, and thank you for keeping kids in mind with the drive thru for moms on the go and flexible menu! I was curious about the Coconut bark, so asked about when I got my food and bam! She already put one in my bag!!!! The burrito was delish, flavorful and fresh!!! For sure coming back! Thank you guys
