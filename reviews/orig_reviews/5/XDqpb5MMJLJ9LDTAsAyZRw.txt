Mouth wateringly delicious! Went there with the fam at 3pm on a Sunday and it was completely packed- long lines and no empty seats- I soon figured out why. 

First! You must have the Carne Asada fries!! (A full one if you are hungry and half if your not; $10 well worth the price) they use the real deal carne asada topped with guacamole, cheese, sourcream and their tasty (spicy) green sauce!! 

Sencond, I highly reccommend Tacos de Pastor (or adobada as they are called at this location) the green sauce is to die for and Tacos de Cabeza! Cilantro-onions- red or green sauce- and guacamole.

Third, You have to try their Horchata- perfect finish to the meal! A little sweeter than how it normally tastes but still very good.

I was in total shock when I saw that they had BUCHE as not many places have this particular meat on the menu nor is it ever cooked right. I didnt get to try it cuz I was too busy stuffing my face with the Carne asada fries but trust me when I say just looking at it, you could tell it would be good! 

If I had to complain about anything, it would be that I wasnt to fond of the way they made the guacamole- it seemed thin and didnt have much flavor, kind of like paste :/ other than that- everthing else was perfect! **TAKE NOTE that there are three or four separate lines each for a different type of meat- Carne Asada-Pork-Pastor*** SO CHECK WITH A COOK OR WORKER BEFORE YOU GET IN LINE!!***
