If you are looking for great New Mexican Food Blue Adobe is the place to go! We have been going there for a few years now and have never been disappointed! The food is great! To Start off the Chips and Salsa are out of this world good! I could easily just eat there Chips and Salsa for a meal! Anything you get on there Menu will be good! i have never gotten anything bad! My personal favorite is the "Land Of Enchantment"! It is a Tenderloin, with Green Chile potato, vegetables and Shrimp! It is kinda pricey but well worth it!! If you wanna try a new good place to eat Go to Blue Adobe!
