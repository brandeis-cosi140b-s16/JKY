The first time I traveled to Chandler, AZ was about a year or two ago to visit relatives who recently moved there. My aunt and I had been shopping all day and she suggested Mexican. I told her if possible to avoid tex-mex restaurants and show me an authentic Mexican place that she has enjoyed.  Well okay, so I admit from the outside, it looked kind of sketchy, but not to the point where it was dangerous, but like "oh gosh am I going to get possible food poisoning after eating here" ? ......... 

Definitely not. This place is AMAZING and when I go back to visit in a month, I arrive in Phoenix around noon and already told my aunt that Guedos is going to be the first stop after getting off the plane !! The food is delicious. Since I had never been there, the owner had me try a little piece of all of the different meats, so I could find out which ones I wanted in my burritos or tacos. You really can't get any more authentic than this and prices were extremely reasonable. We even sat outside under a shaded area and the ground had sand instead of pavement which I thought was cool. Even my other cousin who is a regular visitor to Chandler always remembers to request going to Guedo's for a quick lunch. 

Highly recommended place to eat for a simple and quick lunch !!
