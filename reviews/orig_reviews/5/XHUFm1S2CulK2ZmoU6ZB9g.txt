Well, I found it. I finally found it. The best tacos in Phoenix. Hands down, no question, it's not even close.  I've lived here for about 4 months now and have been to about 20 different taco stands, joints, holes in the wall, trucks, and high end eateries who think charging $3.95 for a street taco is warranted. Damn them, I tell you! Damn them all to hell!!!
TaCarbon is the real-deal-Holyfield, my taco loving compadres!  Nothing pretentious here. Not even plates. Everything, I mean everything, gets served on little styrofoam trays. Don't expect to sit down and have a waiter come to your table and take your order either. You walk in, go straight up to the counter, order your food, grab some sauces, and take a seat. They will call your name when your food is ready. The place is small, jam packed, hot, with a line out the door. And you better know what you want when you get to the counter....patient customer service isn't on the menu.  The food, however, makes up for all that.  The tortillas are exceptionally yummy. I don't know if they make them in house or if they are delivered from somewhere else, but they are the best tortillas ever.  The Hazz (taco or burrito) is the best. Carne asada with roasted peppers and melted cheese on corn tortillas. Insanely good. I had a Hazz taco and burrito.  The Lorenza is another little nugget of heaven that you need to try. We tried almost every taco on the menu and we weren't disappointed with any of them.

If you want to taste the best tacos and burritos in Phoenix this is a place to go. The carne asada is amazing, the tortillas are out of this world, and the sauces are excellent.  Is it in the best neighborhood in town? No. But there are kids and families in a fun and relaxed environment.  Indoor and outdoor seating, oh, and ice cold cervezas!!!

And finally, each taco is under $2!!! Viva-la-good-deal!!!
