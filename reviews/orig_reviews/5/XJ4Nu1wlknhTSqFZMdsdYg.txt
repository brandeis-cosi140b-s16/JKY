I'm not going to lie, extra star cuz I like saying the name.  Chino Bandido!  Say it with me now.  Chino Bandido.

This is a great place for first timers.  They treat you to an array of samples and then hold your hand the rest of the way through your order.

We finally decided to split a combo with jerk chicken fried rice, jerk chicken quesadilla and a milder version (#6) [http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cHdJXLlKNWixBXpDwEGb_A?select=CYvTr9FyNWmnyn4Fqud0QA].

Sutter Home wine for $3 to go with your meal.

The jerk chicken fried rice haunts my dreams.
