Inside tip- ask for a "Claire Enchilada"- beans and avocado for a refreshing and one-of-a kind flavor.  

The crumbled cheese is a fresher, healthier, and more flavor full way to prepare Mexican food- I will forever prefer this cheese over the gooey, slimy, fatty stuff used by other Mexican places.  

For desert, be sure to request them to set aside a flan for you (otherwise they tend to run out on busier nights).  It is a secret family recipe that the woman who makes it for them refuses to ever divulge.  Again, this is unlike any flan you've ever experienced before.  

Happy eating!

Warmly,

Kirin :)
