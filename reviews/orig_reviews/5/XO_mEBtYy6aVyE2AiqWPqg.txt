I feel like this restaurant has taught me what it means to eat good Mexican food.  Tacos de adobada were my favorite.  Very friendly staff.  I didn't try any of the more exotic meats (beef head, tongue,...).  I stuck to the more traditional cuts of pork and beef in tacos.  They have horchata at the drink fountain which was my first time to try and it was very tasty. 

I will DEFINITELY revisit this place everytime I come to Vegas.  It's nowhere near where my hotel usually is, but the trip is worth it.
