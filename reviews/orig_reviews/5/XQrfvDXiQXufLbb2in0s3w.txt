Bomb. I usually don't write reviews after one visit but I tried so many diff't things I feel comfortable doing it. The fish tacos are excellent. Grilled and simple, not slathered in sauce. Ceviche Tostada is one of a kind and excellent. Carne Asada good but not as excellent as the rest. Pastries super yummy and the tortillas (to bring home) are house made and fresh. Oh yeah, the creamy salsa they have is ridiculous. I don't even want to know what's in it because it's so good!
