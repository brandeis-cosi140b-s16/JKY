Fun atmosphere with options for indoor or outdoor seating, even a view of the pond. Our server was friendly, attentive and efficient. The menu offers something for everyone, including vegetarian dishes. We sampled a nice veggie fajita. The carneasada was tasty and the rib eye steak was of good size and cooked perfectly. We also enjoyed the chile rellano con pollo, with just enough of a hot, spicy flavor. The Plato carnitas was a generous portion of succulent pork. The portions were very generous. Entrees priced $12-18, beers $3. Great for a relaxed evening!
