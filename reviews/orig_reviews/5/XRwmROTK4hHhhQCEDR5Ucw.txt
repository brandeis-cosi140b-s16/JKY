I'm a big fan of this place and will definitely be returning! Like eating one gigantic satisfying roll of sushi... There's the perfect rice to fish ratio and the amount of food overall  is just right. Also, try the house made taro chips with cheese sauce. Sounded weird to me at first, but it really does compliment the jaburrito. I finished the whole thing!
