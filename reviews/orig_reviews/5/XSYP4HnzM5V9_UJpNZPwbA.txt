Dear Comedor Guadalajara,

I love you. I miss you. I wish the lightrail went to your doorstep so I could visit you more often!! This is my vote for best Mexican food in the city. Just north of the Salt River on Central Avenue, in what looks like a failing industrial part of the city just seconds south of Downtown Phoenix is this amazing, beautiful gem of a mexican restaurant. 

With a large parking lot that is oftentimes full to the max, it can be a bit of a wait during peak eating hours. My best advice is to come during the off hours. I like 2PM on a saturday best. Everyone is bright and happy and the drinks are flowing (yes at 2PM, don't judge me!) and the salsa is SCORCHING hot! and the chips are yummy and the Beans N Chorizo Dip is incredible! If the salsa is too hot, ask for the mild and/or sour cream. The mild has no heat at all but is still flavorful and you can add as much of the hotter sauce to match your taste. It's delish. I like to order the plate that comes with green chilie relleno and a beef taco w/rice & Beans. My fave! 

This is a good place for large parties, as most tables can accommodate 6 people. and some tables in the back can host even more than that. I've totally seen like 3 birthday parties going on at the same time back there! it was awesome! I scored some free cake! LOL! 

The service is top notch with a super nice general manager who always manages to come by and say hi. I'm starting to think she recognizes me. I've seriously taken all of my friends to this place since rediscovering it two years ago. 

To my yelpers, I say: 
GO! Go now! Get that salsa and enjoy yourself! This place is awesome!
