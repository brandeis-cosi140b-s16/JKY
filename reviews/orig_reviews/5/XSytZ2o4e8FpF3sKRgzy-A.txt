My favorite restaurant in Central Phoenix! The first time I came in I mentioned i was new to town so the manager sent over an order of nachos on the house. I have since been back MANY times and have had an awesome experience so far. For tacos my faves are the baja fish, crispy fish, but the best is the standard. The chicken burrito is surprising with an amazing blend of flavors and the sidewalk chilaquiles are amazing. Great margaritas, not super strong but only $5 on happy hour. Taco Tuesdays are great for cheap tacos. Joyride uses group service so the wait staff is attentive and friendly. The atmosphere is relaxed and fun, I have enjoyed very different experiences from the bar, to the main restaurant, to the patio. A MUST for anyone looking for small bites and great drinks.
