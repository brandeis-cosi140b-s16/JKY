Yelpers you have led me to the promise land again!! Okay, so it may not be as beautiful and as safe an area as I thought the promised land was, but you enter that odd non lit door and bam, you've made it! Not great signage or really anything to shout we are tops for tacos in PHX, but this is not hidden for those who know delicious street tacos. 

You may want to take some time and review the menu before you go if this is your first time. I ordered off the cuff and realized after ordering there were many other things worth trying. That's alright, I ordered enough food for 8 people (there was only 2 of us) all for under $20. This is what I tried:

Asada Street Tacos: 5 Stars - You will get me every time if you can have tender carne asada with onions and a ton of cilantro! Delicious

Molote: 5 Stars - Masa corn fritter filled with Chorizo! No need to say more

Shrimp Street Tacos: 5 Stars - Love the sauce!

Asada Quesadilla: 5 Stars - Fine, yeah I went back to more asada! Awesome!

I will be back, this is just the start of my list here at this taco mecca! One recommendation for these angels of the grill, Adobada!! Amen!
