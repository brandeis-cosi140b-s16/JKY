WOW! Gordo is Lord of all tacos. This place is squeaky clean and the staff is crazy fun and friendly. It's a taco circus with the cast of loco characters whipping out the finest tacos in the land. Very reminiscent of tacos I have had from many a street cart in the old country. So sit your culo gordo down and behold anything from spicy pork, to brains, to tongue, to beef and everything else. My faves so far are the choritzo and the spicy pork. A couple of yelpers have poo pooed the chorizo, I likey. At 2 bucks a pop, this qualifies as some exceptional cheap eats. 
Bonus for the gratis grilled jalape√±o peppers and green onion, the fresh radish and lime station, and the free drink refills.
