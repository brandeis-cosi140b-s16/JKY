Can you say FOOD-GASM? well, if you can't, I will say it again for you: FOOD-GASM!

My BFF (best foodie friend), Emily, took a group of us to this place off the Vegas strip, and now I am even more in love with her food "taste."

I am a sucker for any place that gives you more than one type of "sauce" to dip something in--Mundo gave us 3 yummy salsas to delight my tastebuds. 

If that weren't enough, the Rostisado Chicken (Pollo Rostisado) had enough delectable spices to send me around the world flying on food ecstasy. The creamy street corn had a spicy kick which punched my mouth with flavor. And of course I had to try the Jalapeno risotto, just so my stomach could hate me with heartburn. 

This is not a cheap place, but good friends save their pennies and take other friends with them to food heaven. 

Thank you, Emily for being a good friend :)

(p.s. the service and atmosphere were nice as well)
