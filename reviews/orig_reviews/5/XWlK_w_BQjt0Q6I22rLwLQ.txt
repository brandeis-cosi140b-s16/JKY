We moved here from New Mexico a few months ago, worried about where we were going to get our red and green chili fix (chile truly is addicting!). My son, who already lived here told us about Carlito's. OMG! Not only is the food they serve awesome, I can also buy chile to take home and use in my cooking. 

Carlito's definitely rewards it's return customers.If you give them your phone number when you order, they will track your purchaes, and give you $5 for every $50 you spend. We live about 15 minutes away, but we still manage to eat there 2-3 times a week, especially for the breakfast burritos, (which are delicious any time of day) and 1/2 price all day Sunday and until 11 a.m. on Wednesday.
