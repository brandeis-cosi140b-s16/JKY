Just finished my Paco's mole sampler and it was amazing! We had the El Dorado House salad that was a perfect mix of greens and did not even need dressing but the cilantro dressing was a great addition. I finished off the meal with the free flan given for checking in with yelp. I have never liked flan but am now a convert. This was the most amizing creamy dessert I have had in year. I want more! After the meal Chef Paco came out personally to see if we were satisfied! Thank you we will be back every time we come to Vegas!
