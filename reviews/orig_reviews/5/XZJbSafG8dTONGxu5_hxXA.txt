This is one of those rare places that works for almost any time of day, brunch, lunch dinner, reverse happy hour - this place can cater to your needs perfectly.

Starting with brunch.  I have my daughter every other weekend and whenever she stays over we make it a point to walk over for brunch at least one morning if not both that she's here.  The pancakes are great and to be perfectly honest, between the three large pancakes that they bring out - the plate of eggs and stack of bacon (or whatever other meat you choose) this easy feeds the two of us and is very reasonably priced.  From the adult side of the menu, you can't go wrong with tenderloin benedict topped with jalapeno hollandaise sauce.  

Lunch / Dinner depending on the occasion choose between the normal topside restaurant or the intimate setting of the basement - this place will never fail to deliver.  Fantastic blend of perfectly prepared meat / fish with a slightly southwestern flare in the accompanying sauces and sides.

Happy Hour - Reverse or not - Get a spot at the pounded copper bar and enjoy one of the better "food special" happy hours in the neighborhood.  $5 small plates are a steal and the ambiance of the basement fireplace can't be beat. (Perfect for a date night)
