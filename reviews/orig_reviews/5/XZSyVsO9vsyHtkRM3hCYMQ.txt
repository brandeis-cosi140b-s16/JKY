I have been driving by this restaurant for weeks wanting to try it and we finally did. Good thing we waited because it just opened this week! Very impressed. The food was delicious and the service was quick and attentive. The hot habanero salsa had a good kick to it and my friend even declared it inedible due to the spiciness so fortunately for me I got it all to myself. She also said the shrimp tacos were the best she's ever had. My boyfriend is a very plain eater and the restaurant was able to accommodate our request for a "plain bean and cheese burrito" with no hesitation. I will probably come back in the afternoon sometime for lunch when it's not so busy.
