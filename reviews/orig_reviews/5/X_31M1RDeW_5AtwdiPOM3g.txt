We heartily agree with the current ratings.  This place is as good as it gets. Staff is helpful, efficient and personable.  Kudos to the staff who recognize their customers and appreciate their loyalty.  The gal didn't recognize us and offered us a sample of each of the meats offered.  Nice touch.  At first I wanted a wet burrito and after watching them make their tacos, went that route.  Their spicy meats have a nice flavor with a kick.  Plenty of meat and accoutrements to go inside.  Seating is available in the room next door which is adorned with wrestling memorabilia.  Prices are very affordable.  We will definitely return soon.
