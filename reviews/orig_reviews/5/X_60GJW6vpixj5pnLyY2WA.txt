This place is fun and has some awesome drinks. Prepared to be full when you leave here because between the drinks, the chips and the food with large portions, you will not leave here feeling light. 

It is a fun atmosphere, touristy, but still fun. I love the coconut margarita! They come around and take your photo while you eat (the touristy part I was talking about) and then you can choose to purchase it, or just take the free post card photo. 

I have been here 3 times over the past few years and always have had good service. My friends and I split the veggie fajitas. We split the portion for one, but with chips and guac we were still stuffed. 

Make sure you have some margaritas, they are yummy!
