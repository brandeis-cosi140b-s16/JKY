The taco menu is amazing & so unique. This is not typical AZ Mexican food (it's more gourmet). It reminded me of another restaurant at The Quarter. I only had the tacos so I can't speak for the rest of the menu. They had tons to choose from. One had blue cheese on it. There was one with a fried egg.  Margarita was good. We went during happy hour. Got 10 tacos & 2 drinks for $33. Yum!
