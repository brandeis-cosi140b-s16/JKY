A friend and I decided to stop by here since it's so close to Luke AFB where we are stationed and was told their food was pretty good. We showed up at the time it opened and was greeted by a nice waitor right away, he was nice and friendly, also brought us chips and two kinds of salsa, one was like a picadillo which was very tasty. I ordered a combination plate that had a chicken crispy taco, cheese enchilada with green saue, chile relieno, rice & beans and oh my it was good. I was very pleased and so was my friend who had a chicken quesadilla and taco. I love where its located within a cute neighborhood and how its family owned. I will recommend this place to everybody.
