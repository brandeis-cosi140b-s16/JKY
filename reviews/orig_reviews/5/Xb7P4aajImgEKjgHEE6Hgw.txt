First time - the person who took my order gave me a great run-down of the place and how to order.  I got a chicken quesadilla and my boyfriend got different tacos (fish, beef and chicken).... needless to say everything was amazing!  The hot salsa in the salsa bar was actually HOT salsa unlike everywhere else where you get subpar warm salsa.... it was a great experience and I will defiantly be back!
