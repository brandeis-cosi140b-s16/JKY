I can not wait to go back!
My sweetie and I joined a group to go to Mundo sometime ago and we have been meaning to return.  The lighting is beautiful and the decor is sexy and romanatic.  I will NEVER forget the chopped salad, Holy Smokes best chopped salad EVER!  Normally salad is salad, not at Mundo.  Everything there has intense fresh flavors and colors.  We enjoyed the Chilean sea bass so much we went home and tried to recreate it. . . got close but not quite.  For dessert tres leche, it was simply a perfect end to the perfect high end mexican meal.  Give Mundo a try, you will be glad you did.  :)
