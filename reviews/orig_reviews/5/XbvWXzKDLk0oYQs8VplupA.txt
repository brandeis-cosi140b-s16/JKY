Years of loyalty and i'm finally reviewing... Now i'm not the type of guy that will even acknowledge a conversation when the words "Taco" and "Salad" are put together in the same sentence, but the grilled chicken taco salad at this place is something special. So special, that i'm done with this review. 5 Stars. Get the black beans.
