One of my favorite restaurants and I also love that it is a fox restaurant too!! I'm a huge fan of Sam Fox's restaurants also because half of my friends work at a couple of them! I love the vibe here at Blanco. It's smaller than the Biltmore location but I love it here still. I always get the carne Asada tacos but today I switched it up with the sweet pork. Of course it was award winning! The rice is to die for and not because I'm Asian. The blanco queso is awesome and their complimentary salsa is great too. I always leave happy after a meal at Blanco.
