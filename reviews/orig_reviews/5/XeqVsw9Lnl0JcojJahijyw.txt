Located in a charming old 60's style hotel at 3rd Avenue and Clarendon, south of Indian School Road, it's a funky location.  And the parking is a little hard to come by.   But . . . Hands Down, they make the best guacamole in the western hemisphere!   Order lots of it because it will be inhaled.  They don't take reservations but that's okay, because the bar serves up some fabulous alcoholic concoctions.  2 of our party ordered Cadillace Margaritas and they were so good they ordered 2 more.  I had a lime vodka-based martini.  Excellent.  All 5 of us ordered all manner of soft tacos; chicken, beef, chicken, and my favorite, seared ahi.  

This is not your traditional Phoenix Sonoran mexican food.  It is lighter, fresher, tastier, and hand-crafted to be the best border-style food you've ever had!  

The over-the-top part of our Wednesday evening included Flameno dancing in the room across from the bar which we could easily view from the dining room.   While this was not the traditional Flamenco we have vseen in southern Spain it was an aerobic version that was high energy and lots of fun to watch!
