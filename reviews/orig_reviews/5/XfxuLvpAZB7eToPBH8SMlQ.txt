I am officially a Stand junkie. It only took one time.

I found The Stand on Yelp a while back, and when we tried to go they were closed for a holiday party (nooooo!) so we had to ignore our burger cravings and go get hot wings (well, that actually wasn't so bad). Last night my boyfriend REALLY wanted a burger and insisted we go.

I had visited their website and figured there was no way the burger was going to look like it did on the website...I was wrong. But, I get ahead of myself. We walked in and ALL the staff were super nice. We ordered two Standards with cheese, drinks, and BF got fries (with their special sauce on the side). I totally forgot about their street corn and am cursing myself for not asking about it (but it's seasonal so maybe I'll have to wait anyway). BF got the grilled jalape√±os on his burger, I didn't.

HOLY MOLY. They brought our burgers out and they were gone before I could even snap a picture. They DID look just as awesome as they did on their website. When does that ever happen? The beef cuts combination they use for the burger (short rib, chuck, brisket? I think that's right) makes it the best burger ever. The bun was awesome, the pickles were perfect (not the crappy kind you get in a jar, like most places throw on theirs). Overall, it's a super simple, not fancy burger that is perfection. The fries were a little crispy for my taste but the sauce that came with them was awesome.

The combination of the awesome food, super reasonable prices considering how great the food is, and beyond-nice staff means this will be one of our new go-to places.
