This place has better service by far than any other Rio location. The workers are motivated, attentive, and most importantly professional

The number one thing about this place, freshness. Most notably, the soft and fresh tortillas made minutes before you eat. They also have fresh homemade horchata and other tasty and unique drink options with free refills. In addition to being delicious, this place is vegetarian (even vegan) friendly. 

As some have mentioned, eating here DOES get expensive. A simple burrito will seem to be around $6 at first but after enchilada style, side guacamole and sour cream, and a medium drink, you will find yourself more than doubling your original estimate. That side of guac by the way, is very modest. They do have daily specials though which include a drink in the price. And they also offer a stamp card towards a free meal. However, once you reach ten stamps you have most likely spent around $100 here. 

This is also one of the few foods out there that still tastes great when you order out.
