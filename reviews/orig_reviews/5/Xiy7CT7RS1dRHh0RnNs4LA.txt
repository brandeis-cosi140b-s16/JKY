The Mission is one of my favorite restaurants in town.  I have eaten there several times and the food is consistently excellent.  The street tacos for two that is served on a big rock salt block are particularly good.  Be aware that as of spring of 2015 this is one of the hot spots in town and you will likely need a reservation several days in advance.  There is a large flat parking lot across the street and a garage around the corner that is free.
