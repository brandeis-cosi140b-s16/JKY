As long as you are looking for traditional Mexican food rather than Tex-Mex this place is wonderful. The service is top notch, the food is great, and the live music gives it a flare of excitement and authenticity.

A friend of mine introduced me to this restaurant a while back and ever since then I have been huge fan. They serve things you do not get at chain restaurants like their own specialty noodle soup, which is especially good during the winter season, refried beans as a chip dip, and a array of dishes that are mouth watering. 

The inside is very small and it is more of a locals restaurant than a tourist place which means that it is cheaper cost wise and you get better service. Granted you might get put in a odd spot to eat but I have found that every sitting area offers something different to look at. I love to bring my out of town guest and friends here to eat because it offers such a large variety of food items to chose from and because they always leave satisfied.
