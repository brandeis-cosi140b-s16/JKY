One of the best dining experiences I've had in Las Vegas. My boyfriend and I got the travelzoo deal although after eating there with every dish being excellent we were surprised this restaurant even has one. We started with guacamole and drinks. The guacamole was fresh and flavorful and the drinks were amazing. I highly recommended the coconut mojito. This was followed by the appetizer sampler and the poblano enchiladas and pork shoulder which were all delicious and large portions. I was too full for dessert but my bf loved the arroz con leche. Overall highly recommend this place and we will definitely be back next time were in Vegas.
