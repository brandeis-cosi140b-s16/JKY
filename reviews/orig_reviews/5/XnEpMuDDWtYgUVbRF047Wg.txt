Best date night place ever! They have amazing food and perfectly well mannered waiters and staff. Constantly kept water glasses filled and hey who can complain about a free glass of wine?! (yelp check in offer!)

But the real joy came from the amazing balance of flavors that each dish encapsulated. We started with the guacamole. And wow what a start. Easily the most flavorful guac I've ever had. There is a little spicy kick to it which kept my hand reaching for the chips for more of the hurts so good flavor. Then I got the Mexican risotto which was also yummy along with the tortilla soup which they pour  from the pot to the bowl table side. The real way to win me over is amazing dessert. Two words. Banana empanadas. They had just the right amount of crisp to them and the chocolate ice cream blended with the banana and the cream sauce effortlessly like a match made in heaven. My taste buds were euphoric as I took in each bite.  Hopefully you one day find yourself here in the same state of joy as I was!

One Tid bit is that they have karaoke on Monday nights which makes it much less intimate but also fun in its own way. I think it goes from 5:30-9:30.
