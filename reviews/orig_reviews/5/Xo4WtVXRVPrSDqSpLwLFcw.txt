We went to The Mission to celebrate some news that my boyfriend had, and it was an EXCELLENT choice might I add (on both the news, and the restaurant). Due to us arriving a little later in the night, just before closing, the service was still prompt with great suggestions....

As we both have never been to the The Mission, we entrusted him to select multiple items for us, and each dish came out perfectly, and savory.

The service was excellent with great customer service and quality. The ambiance was gorgeous and classy. I loved the layout, as well as the dimming of lights, architecture, and design of the environment. 

It's a great date place to go. Very romantic and classy. Although it is classy, you do not have to dress up. You can still go very much in casual nice attire. 

Great recommendation!
