Love this place. Come here prob once a week for the chicken salad w the house dressing and extra tortilla chip strips. The ingredients are always fresh and the tortillas are amazing! My mouth waters as I'm waiting in line watching the woman placing the tortillas on the hot rotating griddle to cook them ugh soooo good! I also love their black beans ... If u usually go for pinto give these a try instead u won't be sorry. My family has tried just about everything here from the pork to the grilled steak to the tamales (I think thurs is tamales special they r homemade and delicious) everything is great. Bonus they have diet dr pepper my favorite :) The price is very reasonable for the quality and portion I find it a bargain!
