Mom and I are driving from her home in Connecticut to mine in LA, and we landed here en route on our last overnight. Nacho Daddy was a 30 second walk from our hotel. Checked out the menu online to see if there was anything for my vegetarian mother to eat. A vegan menu with actually tasty-sounding items? Sweet!

We were greeted and seated immediately by a hostess. Our awesome server Nick took care of us, including making sure my food had no tomatoes. This is really important for me, as I have a food sensitivity to raw tomatoes. I had the chicken fajitas, which were delicious and not greasy at all. Loved the addition of scallions. The rice was tasty; refried beans actually tasted of kidney beans for a change. Mom's vegetarian burrito with a veggie patty, black beans, rice and lots of vegetables was also amazing and proved too much for my mom to finish. As a vegetarian, she was impressed that thought had been given to making a great-tasting dish that wasn't an afterthought.

Beer for me and wine for mom -- good selection for both. There's a tasting option for craft ales at 60Â¢/oz on a $10 prepay tab, but it was more beer than I could handle!

I'll be back next time I'm in the area. Nothing to fault, and a lot to like.
