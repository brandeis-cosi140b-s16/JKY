We were so happy to stumble upon La Comida off Freemont street.  We followed the crowd and from the cute alleyway entrance to the comfy booths, were really impressed with the character of the place.  

The cocktails were delicious, the service was attentive and knowledgeable and the food was great.  The chips were homemade and warm, and the salsa was some of the best I've ever tasted - and I've tasted lots.  The guac was fresh.  I had the fajitas and ended up not even needing the tacos and just ate the platter of meat and veggies because it was fresh and well cooked.  

We moved on to Arizona from Vegas where you naturally get tons of Mexican choices and we found ourselves referring back to La Comida as the best authentic cuisine we've experienced the whole trip.  Great find off the beaten path.
