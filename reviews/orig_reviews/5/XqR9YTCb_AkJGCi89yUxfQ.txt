The food is excellent here. I love the beans and salsa they bring to the table. I've had several dishes and have never been unhappy worth any of them.

It's a little but pricey, but you get a lot for your money. 

I loved the live music when we were there last.

I've always had great servers that offer suggestions and are accommodating.
