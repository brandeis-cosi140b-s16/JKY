Well, we found a new favorite restaurant! We have been several times, I just never wrote the review. After seeing the commercial for this place, we decided to drive down and try it. The chips and salsa came as quickly on the 5th visit as they did the first visit. The restaurant is very cute inside, and we have greeted every time by friendly staff members at as we entered the restaurant. The margaritas get 9/10 limes as they are wonderful. They would have received 10/10's but the frozen strawberry margaritas served to the group had sugar on the rim. This family is a salt-on-the rim kind of family, and it would have been nice if the server had asked our preference. I love chile rellenos and of course ordered them here, and have had them each and every time since. Now, the first time I ordered these I wasn't as prepared for the amount of heat and punch the hatch chiles offered-even though I had been prepared/warned by the 3 chili listing on the menu which meant-prepare to sweat (my words not theirs). In other visits my friend asked for the green chiles on the side and this helped reduce the heat.Trust me if the menu states it is 3 chili hot, it is hot. Yummy for those of us that love the heat.
     Only once did we have sub-par service, and of course it was when I took my mom there. I assured her that this waitress and her lackadaisical attitude was not the norm. 4/5 times we had remarkable service. The salsa is great and more is brought quickly when you run out. The food is tasty, and delicious. It is, as I said before, our new favorite restaurant.
