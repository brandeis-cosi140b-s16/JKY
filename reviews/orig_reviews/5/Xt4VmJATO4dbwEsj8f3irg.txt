I've been in AZ for 5 years now.  Came from CA where I have my favorite Mexican places.  We've tried many places out here and couldn't find one to compare.  After reading great reviews on Don Pancho, I decided to try it.  LOVED IT!  Super friendly, there is always somebody cleaning up, fairly fast service even when it's busy, and great prices.  Absolutely love their chips, beans, salsa that is complementary served.  I took my sister and her family.  They went back the very next day with our mom.  My mom has introduced the place to others at her church.  Great place and I will continue to spread the word.
