Wow! Delicious Food, Great Service & Unbelieveable Prices! 

Saw that it was listed as one of the top 5 restaurants being reviewed on Yelp so I had to check it out. 

In a very non-descript strip mall, I found it tucked in the corner, but knew it was a winner by the parking and the people going in and out. 

Walked in and was immediately greeted. After I was seated fresh chips with some of the best salsa I have ever tasted along with guacamole were brought to the table, complimentary! 

They have a menu that takes your mouth around the world with a variety of foods - Korean, Mexican, Chinese & American. 

I had read about the wontons being delicious with a lot of meat, not just a pea size bite. That's right - crispy, hot wonton wrapped around a meatball size of flavor meat, served with a sweet chili sauce. 

The server was extremely friendly and explained to me any of the questions I had about the food. I order 2 of the bulgogi lettuce wraps! It is 30 cents more than the tacos, but who cares when they are still less than $2. 

Lots of layers of flavor in the wraps. Tender, seasoned meat topped with pickled vegetables, YUM. They then give you 3 different hot sauces you can the top them off . 

The table next to me ordered Kim-chee Rice which I will have to get next time when I am with a group of friends. A huge plate of fried rice, topped with a fried egg! 

Along with a drink, my total bill was $8.09. Unbelievable ! 
I can't wait to go back and try something else! 
If you check it out, your tummy will be happy, and so will your wallet!
