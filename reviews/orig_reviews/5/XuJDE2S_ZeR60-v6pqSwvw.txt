My family and i went to vegas last week and we were in the mood for seafood. I searched on yelp and we ended up landing here. The food is amazing. We had the oysters with ceviche on top which were very fresh and tasty. The 7mares was also very delicious and the aguachiles  tostada was to die for. If your ever in vegas and in the mood for seafood....definitely check this place out. :)
