Saw it in the republic and decided to stop. My wife was not hungry but I had eaten hours before her. We got prompt service and soon had mexican beer on tap. My Modelo was the best. Chips and two salsas came soon and they were not hot so most people can eat them the chips were fresh and crisp. I ordered the Burrito with shredded beef and red sauce. It came with rice and beans. The beans contained a bit of bacon and were delicious. The Burrito was one of the best I have had. The beef was smoked or grilled and had the best tasting char to it. We will go back.
