Adobada tacos. SOOOO GOOD! No visit to Vegas is complete without a visit or two to this wonderful establishment. The food here is good any time of the day - breakfast, lunch, dinner, late night snack. 
You order at each station (they all specialize in one/two types of meat). You get your food and pay at the cashier. The first time we went, it was empty and we were confused so the nice ladies walked us through the entire process very patiently.
I will always make sure to make a visit here every time I visit Vegas. This place is THAT GOOD!
