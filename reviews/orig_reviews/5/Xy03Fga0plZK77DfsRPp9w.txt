This place was fabulous!  We have lived in Vegas for 6 years now and we recently went to Coyotes for the first time a couple weeks ago.  The food was very good, the service was wonderful and if you are into drinking margaritas, their house margarita was very good for the price.

We moved to Las Vegas from California 6 years ago and we have not been able to find what we think has been a restaurant that meets the high standards of Mexican restaurants in California.  After eating at Coyotes, we think we have finally found that restaurant.

If you like Mexican food, you can't go wrong with Coyotes!  We will be going back over and over.
