Let me just start off by saying that I'm not a big seafood eater, but with places like this, it is starting to grow.  I'm always up for trying new things, and a fish taco establishment is definitely new for me.  (I know, I'm deprived.)  I work with the owner's wife, so she suggested that I try it.  I decided to look up the place here, and I think it's a good thing if a place has been open for less than two years, has nearly 190 reviews and a rating of 4.5 stars.  That's quite an achievement because the first few years are the hardest for a business.  So I had to go.  After last night, I'm definitely going back.  Everything is made to order, and it's all homemade (try the ranch dressing with French fries - yum).  If you haven't been there before, the staff will let you know what the favorites are and how everything is prepared.  

The menu is small, but I think less is more.  If your menu is too large, then the quality can decrease.  Every bite is packed with delicious flavor.  You get the tacos, and dress them up however you want, so you're responsible if you make it too hot.  :)  Everything is made to order, so if you go during peak times, you can expect to wait a moment or two longer, but they are quick, so you're fine if you only have 30 minutes for lunch....or you could just call ahead so you won't have to inhale your food.  :)

Best of all, this place is doing so well that they are going to open a second location soon in Mesa!  I'm so happy for these guys.  If you're in the mood for something new (if you've never had a fish taco), then definitely try this place.  You'll be glad you did.
