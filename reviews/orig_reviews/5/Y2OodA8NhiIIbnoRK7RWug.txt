Not sure I understand the bad reviews here.  Went here for lunch one day and the food was incredible.  Portions were huge and everything was super SPICY!  Which is why we went here in the first place.  I guess if you do not like spicy then definitely avoid Los Dos.  Servers were very quick and attentive as well.

Still, in shock of the bad reviews!
