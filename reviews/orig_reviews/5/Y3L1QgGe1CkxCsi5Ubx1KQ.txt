Thank heavens I came hungry. Eating just half of my Torta Norteña blasted every last hint of hunger out of my body for the rest of the day (and part of the next day). 

The sandwiches didn't take long after we ordered, but the few minutes we had waiting at our table were filled with sweet horchata and Marc Anthony music videos. 

When the food came, I could only manage to make it halfway through the Torta Norteña, which is a sandwich stuffed with thinly sliced beef, grilled onions, tomato, jalapeños, chipotle mayo, bubbly cheese and fresh avocado. It's a hot mess... and so good you'll WANT to get your hands (and your shirt/pants/neighbor) dirty.

My boyfriend ordered a shrimp ceviche tostada (very tasty) and the Torta de la Reyna, which was enormous and came with everything mine did... plus a zillion other things like chorizo, ham, what looked like a whole omelet, etc. 

We used the Yelp app a lot while we were traveling, which is great when you're looking for something like "cheap Mexican food" because it brings you to neighborhoods you wouldn't normally check out while visiting. This is how we found Los Reyes de la Torta. I'm sure there are plenty of tourists flocking here after the Man vs. Food shout-out (we didn't know 'til we arrived), but it didn't feel the least bit touristy and I I liked that.
