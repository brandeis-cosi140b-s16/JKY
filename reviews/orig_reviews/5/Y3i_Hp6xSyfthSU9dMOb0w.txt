Our favorite Mexican food place EVER! I have been going here since I was a little kid and I got my husband hooked. We Congo about once a week and the staff remembers us. They are always friendly and great with our son. I have never been to a place better than this. The chips and salsa is to die for. The chimis are the best and I love the flautas or the mini Chimi. We are Manuel patrons for life!
