Im going to try to put this into words...because truly there are no words to describe the awesomeness of KoMex. 

First off, we showed up basically at closing and the owners let us dine in and were incredibly nice. This was exactly what I was looking for, a diamond in the rough. I love little joints that are tucked away that just blow your mind. This needs to be on Diners drive ins and dives. Guy would love this place! 

We ordered a bulgogi burrito and quesadilla and pork tacos. The burrito was honestly hands down the best burrito I have ever had...ever. Everything about it was great the meat was well marinated and full of flavor. Tacos were intoxicating and same goes for the quesadilla. We could taste the passion within every bite of every dish. Its easy to see that they have a lot of pride within their food. 

They are located in a little shopping center and could be easily missed if youre from out of town and dont have GPS. Inside is plain but decorated with newspaper and magazine articles notating KoMex's awesomeness. Honestly who cares about what this place looks like its all about the food here. 

I recommend KoMex to anyone and everyone. Its only about 15 mins from the strip and worth it. I would drive any distance to get to Komex. 

I want to thank the owner who I never got the name of for letting us eat right at closing. It was very nice meeting you and we enjoyed the conversation after our meal. PLEASE OPEN A KOMEX IN CALIFORNIA! If not we will be back soon! Any time im in vegas i am going to KoMex, new tradition.
