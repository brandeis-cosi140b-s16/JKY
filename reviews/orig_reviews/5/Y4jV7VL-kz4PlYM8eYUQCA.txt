When I brought my 100% mexican staff to this 100% cracker dominated restaurant during lunch, they looked at me skeptically, rolled their eyes, and said something under their breath in Spanish that I knew was derogatory.  Something about chinita and something about mexican food (I can understand bits and pieces of Spanish, since I'm surrounded by my staff more than I spend with my Love and family)  
 
Hold on, give it a chance!  I tell them....
They look at me and say, yah, like when you took us to Barrio Cafe, only dirtier and still filled with crackers, only this time, there are more mexican servers.  
 
So, I took the liberty of ordering my FAVE torta in the world, and that would be el Americano and ordered the fresca juices to wash it down.   So, they decided to order the same thing just to humor me....  
 
....And after their first bite of the giant torta and by the look on their faces afterwards, I was satisfied.  
 
"Si mon!" was their response.  How did you find this place, THEY ASKED ME....
 
hah.....
