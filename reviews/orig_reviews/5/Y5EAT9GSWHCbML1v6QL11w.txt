First time visit..Went with a group of 28 friends to celebrate Mexican Independence day. 
They gave us free sangria and tequila shots :)
Live mariachi band for entertainment.
The guacamole made at table side by Kendell is to die for. 
This is an excellent Mexican restaurant. 
The location (to the left of Sapphire's entrance) is a little weird, but not a problem.
Had great company, great food and drink. Would definitely go back again.
I asked the woman at the front desk if I could borrow her Mexican Sombrero for some pictures. When I went to return it she told me  to take it home :))
