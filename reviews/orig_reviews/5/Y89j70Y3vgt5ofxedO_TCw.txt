Everything was terrific! The salsa bar had huge variety. Had the Condesa Mahi Mahi tacos, and the veggies were fresh and perfectly cooked. We had a huge party, 8 moms and 10 kids under the age of 5. (We had just toured Stuffington Bear Factory and we are a very rowdy hungry crew). They treated us wonderfully and service was exceptional. All the moms raved about the food. Next time we visit we need to leave the kids at home ;-)
