My favorite Mexican fast food! It's affordable and fast. My boyfriend finally took me here after raving about it and I must say thank goodness! We got the sweet shredded pork burrito. Ask for "enchilada style." So much better because the sauce is amazing. It must be homemade bc I can't find it anywhere in Walmart. We also got some beef and chicken tacos but nothing special. Their flour tortilla is so soft and made fresh. I took pictures for ya'll to see! 

The staff is friendly and generous with the "extras" such as lettuce, lemons, and jalape√±os! Just ask. 

Bon appetite!
