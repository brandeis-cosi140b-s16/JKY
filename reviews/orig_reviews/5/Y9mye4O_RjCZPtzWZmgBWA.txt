I LOVE the Clarendon and therefore I love Gallo Blanco.  Its one of the few restaurants you can make a day-long experience out of.  Firstly, its part of the Clarendon, which is a phoenix landmark in itself.  Super retro hotel with an awesome pool and lounge chairs  for your relaxing pleasures.  

After you swim/sweat up an appetite simply walk into the Gallo Blanco!  I am a sucker for 'all day breakfast' so thats what I stick to.  The Egg Torta is amazing as is the Chilaquiles Verdes. My friend did stray from the breakfasty foods and she raved about whatever she ordered as well!  The restaurant sticks with the retro vibe and does make you feel like you stepped into a post-mod Phoenix :)  Lovely.
