The best happy hour for food $1 street taco (carnitas is amazing!) and drinks for sure! The environment is great and I've never gone and not been greeted by all the friendly staff especially Chef Paco! This is such great Mexican food and all GMO free which is so great! Their table side guacamole makes a fun extra. I've tried several dishes and none have disappointed big plus is that it's open late too. Def have to try!
