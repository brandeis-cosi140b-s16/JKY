I travel the Western States frequently, and I lived in Vegas for a couple years... This is by far my absolute most favorite Mexican Restaurant ever! Over the last 15 years, I have sent friends, co-workers, and family to this business - and I have always received nothing but compliments on the suggestion.

After I moved back to Washington, I would come into town every 5 to 8 months for work, and of course this is where I'm going for dinner... I would head to the bar, and the bartender would ask, Carne Asada as usual... NICE!!

While I lived in Vegas I did go there for lunch or dinner at least 3 times a week, but I was stunned when she remembered me and my order from several months earlier... 

The one on DI (Desert Inn & Eastern) is the original. I guess the family peeled off and opened a few others around Vegas, but I like this one the best... Cheers!
