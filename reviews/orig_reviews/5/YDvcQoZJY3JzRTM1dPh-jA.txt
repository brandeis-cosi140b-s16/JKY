BEST TORTILLAS! PERIOD!
What an interesting place. I was amazed to see two hummers, a porsche, two beemers and a handful of trucks at "7: 30  AM"
Breakfast burritos (Machaca+eggs) were so good, I drove back from Scottsdale for breakfast. This place is unbelievable. I highly reccommend a visit and buying a few dozons of tortillas (they freeze well, but separating the tortillas with a layer of plastic wrap will make your life very easy).
If you have "done" Carolina's - SHOUT OUT!
