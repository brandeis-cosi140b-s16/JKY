We always leave Cantina happier than we arrived. We've sat at the bar for apps and margaritas or dinner on the patio. Tonight we had dinner in the dining room. The tostada appetizer was to die. I had the veggie enchiladas and my fianc√© had a beef burrito. Delicious! Lucky for us we each had leftovers which we'll devour for lunch tomorrow.
