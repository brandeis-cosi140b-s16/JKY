The only non-gmo restaurant in Las Vegas!! They take pride in where they source their ingredients from and how they prepare their food and you can tell. We went on locals Monday which earned us 50% off our entire bill! The only surprising/humorous thing is that they are located in the same building as sapphires gentleman club....lol. As long as you are not super conservative this should not offend you. They have their own separate entrance.  The restaurant is gorgeous. They had a great selection of beers however they were out of the ones we ordered, no worries they provided us with great alternatives. We ordered the gorditas to start with. I ordered the chicken milanessa and my bf ordered an asada burrito.  Both were very delicious, I only wish we had room for dessert  I will definitely be back and telling all my friends about this place!
