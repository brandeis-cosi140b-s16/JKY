This is some of the best Mexican food on the planet and as authentic as it gets. It's the Mexican restaurant that I compare all other Mexican restaurants to. When I lived nearby back in the '90s, I used to eat here several times a week. Though I now live far away in the East Valley, whenever I have to travel into Phoenix for something, I always take the opportunity to hit La Tolteca. They have exotic offal dishes (my personal favorites are the cabeza and lengua--head and tongue, respectively) but if you're not that gastronomically daring then fear not: there are also more conventional offerings that make use of regular cuts of beef, pork and chicken. 

In a nutshell, there are a wide variety of dishes here and something to suit every taste. The food is great, the portions are generous and prices are modest. It really doesn't get any better than this. Try it, you'll like it.
