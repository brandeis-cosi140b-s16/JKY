My wife and I were spending time with another couple at old town Scottsdale and we decided to eat at The Mission.  This was our first time here and all four of us were extremely happy that we chose The Mission.  Everything about the experience was awesome.  You must get the table-side guacamole, it was amazing!

The entree portions were just the right amount because you'll definitely want to enjoy all the chips and guacamole.  Very yummy!  Plus, the service and drinks were superb.  We were able to get in right away on this visit, but I would recommend making a reservation via Opentable to ensure you get a table.  You won't be disappointed.

We are looking forward to going back to dine on the patio again.
