Stayed at the Aria and this was really the only meal-meal we ate in the hotel.  It was delicious!  The jalapeno margaritas are just the right amount of lime and spice.  My chicken fajitas were made with Jidori chicken (who does that!?!?!  Vegas, that's who) and were ridiculously good.  

Like many restaurants in Vegas (and especially the newer casinos), it's loud so if you're looking to whisper sweet nothings in your honey's ear, she won't hear you.  Also, it seems to attract bachelorette parties (we saw three while we were there) so prepare for some shrieking with your guacamole.
