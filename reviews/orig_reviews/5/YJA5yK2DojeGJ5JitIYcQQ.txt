No sign on the door--little bitty tiny eating space--the bar takes up half the teensy space--food is to die for. Yep, we're at Dick's Hideaway!!! We've eaten here several times but have yet to have a bad meal. 

Everything is fabulous, it's close to home and it's kind of like our little secret. In fact, I'm kind of scared to write this review because I'm afraid that everybody and his/her dog is gonna want to come here and then I'll NEVER get a table! [not that we've ever gotten one of the three tables, we've always settled for the eat-on bar.]

It's run by the same nice folks who own Richardson's around the corner, so you know you'll always get a great meal. 

And if your party runs more than three, you can always reserve the party room next door--it's actually the wine room with a big copper-topped table and lots and lots of ambience.

Let's just put it this way--it's way different than anything else in town, and that's a good thing.
