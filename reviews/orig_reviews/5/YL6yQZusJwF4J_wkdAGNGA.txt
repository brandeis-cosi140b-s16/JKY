If you want an authentic Mexican atmosphere, this is the place.  They have a trio playing popular and traditional songs at your request (weekends/weeknights).  The seafood selection is just right.  I've had the shrimp enchiladas and the shrimp in mushroom sauce with the "toritos" as an appetizer.  They are jalapeno peppers stuffed with cream cheese and wrapped up in bacon, drenched in soy sauce.  Heart attack city but so worth it.   The only downfall for me is that there are way too many tables for the space and the noise level is at times a little overwhelming but after a few Micheladas (beer with clamato) the noise becomes happy whispers.
