Finally, a fantastic restaurant in Las Vegas that doesn't cost a fortune.  I went to Hussongs with a bunch of my buddy's as we were just looking for an inexpensive start to a long night.  What we got was the best margaritas, good beer cheap, outstanding Mexican food and cute waitresses and bartenders.  Our intention was to start the evening there and move on to a club after a few drinks but ended up closing the joint down after many shots of tequila!

If you have ever been to the original in Ensenada and had as most do, an unforgettable experience, I can tell you that this place does the original justice.  With a motto of "More Tequila, Less Ice", it is tough to go wrong.
