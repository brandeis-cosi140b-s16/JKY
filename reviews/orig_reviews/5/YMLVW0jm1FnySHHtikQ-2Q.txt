I am very pleased to have another great spot to eat at in the neighborhood.  THE STAND has a great burger . . . make sure you order it with cheese and the butter caramelized onions.  They have short rib tacos and veggie tacos and they are excellent and well priced.  If you like a milk shake with your burger, I'd order the chocolate . . . I'm not brave enough yet to try the chocolate chile shake but I hear it's something you have to try.

You'll also be treated very well by the great staff. Keep up the good work Ron and company . . . I vote with my business and I've been there 3 times in 10 days which speaks volumes.
