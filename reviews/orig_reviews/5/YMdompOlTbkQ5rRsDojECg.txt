Finally gave this place a try after driving by it numerous times and joked about eating there.  And then it happened. 

Fat Boy is a tiny little restaurant that is hidden in East Las Vegas. The place seats about 15 people - it definitely has this homey, only-for-locals kind of feel to it. 

I had a guacamole cheeseburger with fat fries, and the boyfriend had a chicken burrito with chencho fries.  I was half expecting the food to be overrated, but I was amazed at how fresh my burger was!  And how much I love my fries!!! I ADORE FAT FRIES!!!  The fries have these seasonings on them that just make them super yummy!  And they were FAT and huge!  

The Chencho fries were covered with a green salsa and onions and cheese; it was yummy enough - a bit fattening though. 

I have suggested to return to this place numerous times after the first encounter, and that is pretty rare for me.  Enjoy!
