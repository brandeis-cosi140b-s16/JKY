Place was welcoming and food n' drinks were spectacular! The service was decent and free samples are a plus if you've never had anything form them. 

The only thing i wish they'd change up is the quantity. The quality of the food is refreshing. Not really leaving you heavy, which is a plus for me. But i would definitely recommend anyone here for some fresh n easy Mexican food.
