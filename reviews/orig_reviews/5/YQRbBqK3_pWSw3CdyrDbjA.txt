Dick's is an interesting, fun, little ( I really mean little) place for food and cocktails.  It's just what it says it is...a hideaway.  If you are claustrophobic, this might not be the place for you.  If you want airy, fanciness, again, probably not for you.  To use the restrooms you have to go through the kitchen, which is fun.  Love the special prickly pear margaritas.  The chips and salsa spread our server hooked us up with was epic, while not even on the menu.  He made us feel special!
