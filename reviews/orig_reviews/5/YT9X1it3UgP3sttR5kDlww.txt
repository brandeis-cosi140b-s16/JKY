Ok....this is officially my favorite Mexican restaurant so far.  
The location is great for me, so we thought we would stop on the way to Fremont to check it out. Glad we did.  Although the lady at the front was kinda rude, she was the only one the rest of the night that was.  Everyone from the hostess, to the many waiters checking on us, were all super friendly and accommodating. 
I ordered the jumbo Cadillac margarita, and my friend got a frozen mixed mango and strawberry margarita. Check out the picture. It was so pretty!  
We got chips, salsa, and beans when we first sat down. The salsa was not the best I ever had, but it was good and I loved that it was actually spicy. Then we ordered cheese dip and guacamole to go with it. The cheese was good, and the guacamole was delicious. However, this was a mistake, because when we were into our second basket of chips, we realized we were too full for our meal. 
We had ordered the mixed appetizer for two, which was $20. Surprisingly everything on the plate was good. It had chicken chimichangas, beef flautas, carne asada nachos and quesadillas. It was way too much food, but we had to at least try everything....it was all good, so needless to say, we were stuffed. 
After we finished our drinks, the waiters rolled us out to the curb for a cab pick up. 
I will definitely be back!!!
