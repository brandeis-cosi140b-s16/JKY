El Bravo is certainly on my new list for go-to Mexican Restaurants.  The place is spotless (even though the building to the north looks like people have been sleeping out front).  You really cannot tell by driving by, but the interior is bright, open and full of great smells.

Chicken Tamale Combo for lunch included a shredded pork flauta and a ground beef taco that was one of the best in town.  Ground beef tacos usually remind me of Toxic Bell, but this one had very flavorful, but not overspiced meat and a homemade shell.  Tamale was sweet and delicious.  Flauta was better than average.  Beans and rice were excellent and homemade as well.

While eating, one of the owners was talking to, I guess, her daughter.  It was a total George Lopez, "Why you crying" story.  There is definitely a lot of love in this great mom and pop establishment.

$13 food, tax, tip.
