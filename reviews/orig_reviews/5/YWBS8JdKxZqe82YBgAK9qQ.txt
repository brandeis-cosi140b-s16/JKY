Yummy times infinity!! Love the tacos de lengua, their super soft and not overly salty. The Jamaica is tasty and fresh, I went on a Sunday when they were offering buy two get one taco free (I think it was only that night). I'm excited to try other stuff too, but so far hands down on the tacos de lengua, tacos de al pastor, and the salsa bar.
