Do you love Chile Rellenos?  This place has the real deal and they are very inexpensive.  I had their combo 15 plate that also includes beans (awesome) and rice (awesome) and enchiladas (good, but needed a little onion).   Be sure and ask for some salsa for your table - it is in a squeeze bottle and I pretty much used up the entire bottle because it is so tasty!  Lunch hour during school days is very busy so if you come at lunch when school is in session, plan on standing in line.
