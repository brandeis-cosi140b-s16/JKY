What can a say - Barrio is a winner.

The fish tacos, of which I am most certainly a conusieeur - are the best I've ever had.

The guacamole is fresh and delicious, the sangria is so favorful.

The best part of the place is the ambiance, the feel, the live music on Saturday night, the artwork inside and out.  There are awesome murals in the back parking lot area - great for photo ops.

True Arizona, great quality.
