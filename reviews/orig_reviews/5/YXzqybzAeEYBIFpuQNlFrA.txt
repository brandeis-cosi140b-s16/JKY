Mexican-Asian Fusion? It should not be good, right? I mean, I avoided this place for months, despite the beckoning pink sign on Scottsdale Road, because Asian food is awesome and Mexican food is awesome, but I could not imagine them being awesome together. Wow, I was wrong! 

My favorite thing to get at Sumo Maya is the Pomegranate Guacamole and the Maya Roll. 

The Maya Roll has tuna, crispy rice, masago, micro shiso and wasabi aioli, and it's delicious. I love how the crispy rice on the outside gives the roll a nice crunch without being deep-fried, and the wasabi aioli is very, very yummy.
