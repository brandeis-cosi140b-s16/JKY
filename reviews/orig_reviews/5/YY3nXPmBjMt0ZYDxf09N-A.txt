Food was super yum. Yum yum. It took a little long to get some water, which we really needed because we were pigging out on the delicious salsas. Carne Asada with enchilada plate was amazing... Super soft meat seasoned really well. The bean and cheese burro was on the money. Whatever this place lacks it makes up for in food quality.
