Not what I was expecting...looked like a dive but Iwas pleasantly suprised. Super fresh tacos. The best tacos my husband and I have ever had and he used to live in Mexico!  I can't pick a favorite, we sampled 5 tacos and they were all great. Each had a unique blend of flavors made with the freshest ingredients. We intended to go to another Taco joint Yayo Taco but found out it was closed. Happened to drive by this place and decided to give it a try. I'm so glad we stopped!
