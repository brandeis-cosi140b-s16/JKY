Elmer, I love you.

I have since I was a senior at Chandler High. Back then I was broke so I could only get a bean burrito and strips...and they were dang good. 

If anyone wants to complain about strips just being chips and cheese they can suck it.

Now days I am a little less broke so I always get the green chili burro. And it is always so good. Spicy enough to burn a little and the tortilla is always fresh...thanks man.

And bless your little Mexican Heart, you serve corn dogs...so I can even come here with my crazy picky kids. 

I love you Elmer. I always will.
