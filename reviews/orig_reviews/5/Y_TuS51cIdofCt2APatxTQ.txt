I tried it for the first time. The restaurant has cozy environment, friendly staffs, and pretty good food. I ordered the combination came with carnitas taco, chicken Tamales, chili relleno, rice, soup and salad. The food is good but don't expect home made style food. Its more like upper scale food. However I like more home made style its just my preference.
