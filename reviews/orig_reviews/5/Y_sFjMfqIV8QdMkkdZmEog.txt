Waited about 20 minutes before I was able to order my tacos. Got up to the front of the line and told the guy what I wanted. These guys are hustlers for real. They seem to enjoy doing what they do. Singing laughing cooking, etc. It was great seeing that. I was still buzzin from the night before so i couldnt wait to stuff my face with these tacos. Made right in front of you exactly how you want them.
