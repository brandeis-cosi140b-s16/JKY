Food was excellent but the service is OUTSTANDING. After they sat us, we waited for a server for about fifteen minutes (I think because they were busy). So, I popped inside to enquire about the wait. Almost immediately, the manager and sever came to our table, and while apologizing profusely, offered to buy us an appetizer to make up for the wait. They were unbelievably kind and cheerful and we will absolutely be back. We got the stuffed pineapple app and the Jesus tacos - both of which were delicious. This place is a gem.
