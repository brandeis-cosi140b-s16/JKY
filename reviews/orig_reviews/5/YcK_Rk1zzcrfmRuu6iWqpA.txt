Feb 22 - Adjust to 5 stars.  We have now ordered take out several times from this place and it is yummy.  On top of it, the staff are so incredibly friendly to my husband and daughter.  Top notch service and food deserve 5 stars. 

All of these years living down the street we never went in because we thought it was a bar. We turned to Yelp for a carryout place and saw the reviews. My hubbie and I were pleasantly surprised. We placed the order and it was ready in ten minutes. The food came home piping hot. Salsa and chips were yummy. I had a chicken chimichanga smothered in guacamole and sour cream. The chicken in the chimichanga burrito consisted of all white meat - moist and flavorful. 

My husband had a combo plate - an enchilada, relleno, rice, beans and beef taco. I think the relleno was wrapped in a corn tortilla, not the traditional egg batter. It was a bit strange.  The green chili itself was flavorful. Being from NM, I am used to a red sauce being made from red chili powder. I could not quite distinguish what the sauce was made from that covered the enchilada.  

All in all the food was quite tasty and reasonable for the amount of food we received. On top of it the service both over the phone and on site were great. My husband said the place was packed when he stopped by around 6:30 pm.
