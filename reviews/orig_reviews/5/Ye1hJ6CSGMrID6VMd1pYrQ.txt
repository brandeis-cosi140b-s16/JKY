My only qualm with Barrio Queen is that I ate so much that I hurt...

From the table side guacamole with pomegranate seeds mixed in (try it) to the multitude of tacos and burritos, you really cannot go wrong. If you are looking for a suggestion, anything "al pastor" is my favorite kind of pork. This place really should be neighborhood royalty in Scottsdale.
