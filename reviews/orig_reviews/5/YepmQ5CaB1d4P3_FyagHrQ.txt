I'm 100% Mexican n tasted tacos in Mexico many years BUT this place is for sure the best or the closest to the best al pastor tacos I Eva tried !!!!!!!
I been trying for months to find al pastor tacos like this restaurant in Chicago but nothing so far
If I Eva go back to Las Vegas 
Which btw I went to the chef Ramsay restaurant n tried his $70 steak which was good 
But Idk man 
The al pastor tacos in here are kinda close to that steak I had
