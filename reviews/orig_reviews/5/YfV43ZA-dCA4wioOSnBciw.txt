I hate myself sometimes when trying a new taco place, I tend to claim "this is my new favorite."  I guess I need to develop a new rigorous grading scale when trying new taco joints.  Maybe its some underlying factors that triggers my favoritism towards new places? Who knows.

Just before entering the shop, I saw crowds sitting outside gleefully chomping away.  Peeping through the window were "hangry" folks waiting to order.  These clues made it obvious that I came to the right place.

Once I entered the building, there was a frenzy of people getting their food and grabbing utensils and sauces.  Luckily the line wasn't intolerable that my stomach would throw a fit.  The smell of grilled meat only salivated the hunger even more.

The menu isn't so big but it offers plenty to satisfy your faux Mexican taste buds.  Of course I had to get the tacos as a first timer.  I went for the usual Carne Asada and the Birria (recommended by the staff).  While the Carne Asada tacos were cooked and tasted perfectly, I now favor the Birria.  To describe it, its got a nice crunchy texture with some deep flavors.  But you have to complement it with its fire hot sauce.  Boy did it burn.  I like a burn like this every now and then.

You have to wash it down with either a Mexican Coke and something really sweet to counter the burn.

If this review doesn't scream at you, then surely the number of stars will.
