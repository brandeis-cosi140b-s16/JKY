I came here at night for a late night dinner.  Man, living in LA where we have hundreds of taco places, I have NEVER seen a taco place this packed.  There was basically no room for you to walk around and the lines are long.  Make sure you read what sign for each line, because its different meat.  The best way is to have a least one other person so you can have multiple choices of meat.  If you ate by yourself you'll have to get in line twice :(. Anyways, we got the carne asada and al pastor.  I love the charcoal taste of the carne asada, but waitttt the al pastor was every better.  The al pastor with the sauce was perfect.  This is definitely one of the best tacos I've ever had.  I think I'll have to stop by the San Diego location, which is closer to me!
