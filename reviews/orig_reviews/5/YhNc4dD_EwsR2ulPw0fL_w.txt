This is hands down the BEST Mexican restaurant around!! The food is excellent with plenty of flavor! I love the nachos, the tacos, the burritos, and the spinach dip is amazing - and I don't even like spinach!! The chips and salsa are really good. They give you a mild and hot salsa, which taste freshly made. Both have great flavor. I prefer to mix them because the hot is REALLY hot (to me) but still very good!! The service is fast and the servers are very friendly! They recently remodeled and it really cuts down on the wait times. Great atmosphere and great food!!
