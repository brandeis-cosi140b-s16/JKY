This place is wonderful! The decorations are authentic and neat and the food is delicious. They have a HUGE selection of salsas, I enjoyed their guacamole and peanut salsa. My boyfriend and I ordered yummy Mexican Coke in the bottle, our favorite. I ordered two of their carne asada tacos with pickled onions and chimichurri sauce which came with rice and beans with fresh cheese on top, it was fantastic. My boyfriend got the bullet burro which he absolutely loved. We'll definitely be coming back to try more of their salsas!
