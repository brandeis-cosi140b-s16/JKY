Great food. We had the red sangria and it was light and refreshing.  The cheese crisp with the braised pork was light and so fresh. You have to try the street corn. It was great on the cheese crisp. They let you mix up the tacos so you can try the variety. We ended with the mexican chocolate cake. Great end to a great anniversary.  Our server was Ganby and she is a main reason we will be back. You guys rocked it.
