Once again, A review lost in the Yelp black hole. I know I did a review on this before! Anyway, Wife and I had the foster kids, and Mom with us. We decided to meet our daughter and boyfriend for dinner. We were supposed to eat somewhere else, however something happened and I was in a rush to find a place. I have heard of Don Pancho, but did not know this was a hole in the wall joint. When we arrived here, I was like no way! Not going to eat here. It was getting late and my mom was like, the kids are hungry and lets just eat here. 
1st, 
There was ten of us,
2nd,
Don Pancho was going to close in a half hour. However they said not a problem. So they put a few tables together for us and we all sat down.

We ordered all sorts of items. I had the chili verde burrito, it was great. My mom and some kind of quesadilla. It was corn and fried. It was awesome. I had the luxury to try many items that night, and I can not say there was anything bad. 
Workers there are really nice, they did not have to serve us so late, but they did and I am glad. Prices are very reasonable, Food is great. 

They fooled me, I wasn't interested to eat here, but thanks to mom. We tried it and can't wait to come back.
