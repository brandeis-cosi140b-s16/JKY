I love this place. It's by far the greatest value for money around UNLV campus. Try a tostada salad with chicken or pork and house dressing. If you want a lot of food try a steak salad and a one of their deserts. 

Staff members are constantly rotating but overall are nice young guys. One of the managers looks unnecessary mean (a girl server said that she can't put more cheese on my plate because the manager will yell at her). Please, don't yell at them! I ate at your place literally over 100 times and my loyalty is worth more than this extra grain of rice. Please keep refilling your teas too.
