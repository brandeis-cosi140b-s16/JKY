I have no connection to the restaurant and my review is based on honest opinion.....The food IS special and way above average for a Mexican restaurant..... but cannot BELIEVE anyone would think this restaurant is only average or nothing special. 
Give this family owned restaurant a try....they have survived decades  in the restaurant business and definitely not a franchise typical chain,  Check out their history and better yet try a meal at their great restaurant on Dobson, you'll be back.
