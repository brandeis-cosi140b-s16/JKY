Border Grill stems from the Border Grill and Ciudad restuarant owners based in Santa Monica/LA.  There is a reason why another one was asked to open in Las vegas, same reason why any  other famous restuarant opens another flagship place in LV, bc it's DAMN GOOD.  Border Grill delivers.  I typically think mexican food is best served from a whole in a wall near the border with a questionably stolen grade A sign and full of grease fat and hot sauce.  However, this is one of the few upscale Mexican places I think pulls off delicous and unique yet tasteful dishes.  We got the sampler appeititizer which is the way to go if you want ot try a little bit of many things Border grill has to offer- including the famous Food Network's Too hot Tamales- which YES are very very good.  All the food is fresh and has a great upscale spin to the flavors.  Along with the view of Mandalay's pools, you sort of feel that you are smack in the middle of a Mexician riveria.  

I think one major reason why I am SUCH a big Fan of Susan Feniger and her restuarants are the politics and community involvement she always has.  She doesn't just cook and make delicous food, but she is active in the food industry in its current revolution.  She makes an effort to be responsible to the enviroment and its resources by using organic or sustainble ingredients.  She is currently offering special priced dinner in LA where a portion of profits go to Scleroderma research.  She constantly offers moderate/affordable pricing to her food (like participating in Dine LA)- even in Vegas where every other restuarant is inflatted to Disneylandesque prices.  Best of all, she is an LGBT chef that always supports her local LGBT communties.   Ive never seen a chef so involved in her work that continues to care and give back.   It makes you feel like all she wants is to have her customers enjoy food and life as much as she does.
