What can I say about this place that people haven't already said?! As you can see by my frequent visits, I'm hooked on their tacos! I have tried their carne asada tacos and carne asada fries but nothing comes close to the tacos de adobada (spicy pork tacos). My bf says they taste just like the ones from TJ!
The staff here is really friendly, they even have my order memorized (7 spicy pork tacos) and no they're not all for me! hehe
Make sure you get a side of green onions and chilies and sprinkle them with salt....
Think I might go there now! Enjoy
