Protip: Add the Fried Egg to the Torta. 
After visiting El Hefe in both the Scottsdale and Chicago locations I must say that this is one of my favorite places to get a modern spin on delicious Mexican food and watch a game, party or attend Happy Hour. The vibe and energy of the bar can't be denied.

If you're looking for a nice quiet night out then this is surely not going to be the venue for you. But if you want to have fun, get a great Beer-Garita (all time amazing) and some high quality Mexican food this is the place. I didn't even know Duck Carnitas were possible until coming here and they did not disappoint one bit. It's hard to pick a favorite taco because they are all enjoyable. 

Whenever I can visit Scottsdale or Chicago, El Hefe is a must stop to watch a Bears or Blackhawks game. I'd argue it's almost as fun as actually attending the games themselves!
