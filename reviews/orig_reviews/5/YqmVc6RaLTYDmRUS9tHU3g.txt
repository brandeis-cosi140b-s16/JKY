These guys are great!  Fresh grilled or fried fish tacos for $2.50!! Including all the fixings. The habanero sauce is flavorful and hot.  The mild sauce they make special for the fish tacos is also very good. And they're open all hours.  The manager threw in a couple freshly grilled jalape√±os too!  Definitely going back for more.
