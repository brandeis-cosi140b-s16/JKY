I recommend going to MadMex for half-off late night! So good and so cheap! My huge burrito that I had was less than $5 but it was so filling I couldn't even walk because I was so full. It's a bit small so there may be a wait, but its so worth. And you can always call in to make a reservation. I would definitely recommend the burritos and the buffalo wings.
