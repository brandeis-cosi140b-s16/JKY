What a great place!  Very crowded night. Steelers playing. Had a spicy cucumber margarita. Fantastic, not spicy at all. Guacamole is really good. We ordered the mushroom tacos and the chicken tacos. Never got to the chicken, they are in my fridge right now. I would eat the mushroom tacos again and again. We love all the great restaurants in Pittsburgh, this is at the top of the list. Go there!!!
