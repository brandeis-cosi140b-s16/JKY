This stop was the highlight of my 4 day trip to Vegas which is saying a lot. I found out ahead of time that they had recently started a vegan menu, it wasn't posted online, but a quick email got me a copy of it. Prices were high as is to be expected in a Vegas hotel mall, but it was so tasty and the service was great. I am in love with the salsa here and love any place that brings you more than one variety. Plus the chips were slightly thicker than usual which made them extra delicious. I'm sure my giant margarita didn't hurt anything either. Mostly though I must rave about my vegan enchilada which came with gardein and daiya and the most delicious sauce. These types of mexican meals are being much more common as easy to make vegan food becomes accesible via these already manufactured product mainstays but this was still better than any similar enchilada I have ever had. It was so tasty that I decided to carry the rest of it around in a bag for the next 5 hours before finally eating it standing over a trash can on fremont street. The menu had a lot of other great looking vegan items as well, including a chili relleno, which I have never seen before. My boyfriend enjoyed his non vegan variety. I will definetetely be adding this to all my future Vegas vacations and can even say it was worth the 2 hour duece ride from my hotel on the opposite end of the strip.
