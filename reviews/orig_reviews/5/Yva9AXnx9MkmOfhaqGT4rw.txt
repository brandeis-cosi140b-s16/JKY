The most authentic Mexican food in Vegas, I couldn't even wait to get back on the road before one of their delicious tacos was in my FACE. Hands down. No argument. No contest. BEST other than going to the homeland yourself. And they have a DRIVE THROUGH!! I was in HEAVEN. 

Tip: cash only drive-through, but they also take debit cards!
