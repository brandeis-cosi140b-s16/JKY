Found this spot by chance and was pleasantly surprised. Great service and even better food. 99 cent Margaritas on Saturday to top it off!?!? Who can ask for more? Locals made it sure to recommend dishes to try and my fav was the "Pollo Burro" Walking in to this place and seeing how many people were there was the best sign I could get that I was in for a treat. Def must go!!! Additional parking in the back if the front is full. Bon Appetite.
