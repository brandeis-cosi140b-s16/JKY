Glad I saw the review on Yelp or I would never have noticed this place tucked in next to Nothing Bundt Cakes. It's delicious! We had the flautas (veggie types note that you can also get pepper & potato, no meat), huevos rancheros, and elotes & esquites (although we realized these are basically the same, just one is on the cob and one in a dish). Even though we were stuffed, we also had the fried ice cream. Everything was delicious and very fresh. We will be back!
