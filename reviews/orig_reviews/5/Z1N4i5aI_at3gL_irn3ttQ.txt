I am happy to say that the newest store in the family is as great as all the rest. We went on Friday evening and the place was packed.The service was excellent as was the food. We were seated promptly and were treated like family. Reminded me of the old days going to the "A" frame in Mesa. I highly recommend  and will return soon. Bonus of running into old friends.
