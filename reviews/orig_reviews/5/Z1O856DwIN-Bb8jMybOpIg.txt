Great service, So  Friendly! Everyone was able to answer questions we had about the food, how it was made and what came with it or on it. Every detail to our request was met. The atmosphere was casual, fun and ethnic. Although we sat inside, The patio looked very  inviting with it strung lights and cozy tables.  And the food....WOW!! So Authentic, Fresh and tasty. This place is right in my neighborhood and I will definately recommend and return with friends.
