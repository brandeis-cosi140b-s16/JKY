They only have a few options on the menu (which shows to me that they're confident in what they offer). The burgers are very high quality. I think they even put rib meat in them. The customer service is great, they walk over and give you your food at your table and pick up your tray when you're done. The fries were fresh tasting and weren't too greasy. Overall, I highly recommend this place.
