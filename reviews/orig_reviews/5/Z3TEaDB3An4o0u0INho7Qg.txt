Hands down the best mexican I've had in town...so far.  Very authentic and they have a huge menu that should suit every taste.  In the middle room you can even see the tortillas being freshly made.  The only thing that was bad about my second trip was the fact that for the life of me I couldn't remember what I got the first time to order it again...but my second meal was excellent as well.

The guac is made table side and is super fresh.  I love making homemade guac myself and actually will not make it without cilantro anymore because they used it at Lindo and it really made a difference.

We live a good 6 miles or so away and on the way everyone was asking why we were traveling so far for this restaurant and if we were getting Mexican food, why we couldn't go to one of the one hundred places that are closer.  By the end of the meal everyone need why and gave me kudos for the selection.

It will be hard to go anywhere else when I have a craving for Mexican food.
