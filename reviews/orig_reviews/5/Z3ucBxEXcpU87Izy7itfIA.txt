I've been eating at Lulu's since it first opened. Now I have to drive from Glendale to Gilbert for her addicting burritos. If you care about really good beans, rice, and fresh tortillas, than Lulu's in the best. I have a bean addiction, but other people in my family love her tacos and still will drive 45mins for them.
