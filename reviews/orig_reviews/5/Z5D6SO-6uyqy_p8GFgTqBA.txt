Fantastic!   We checked it out for happy hour and I'm hooked!   The restaurant is beautiful and the menu has a great variety.   We tried the guacamole,  mushroom tacos and chicken tacos.  Everything was absolutely delicious.  I don't like super sweet drinks so the bartender suggested a coconut cocktail.  She actually made it less sweet than usual and it was perfect.   Delicious food, great drinks and fabulous happy hour prices.  What else can a girl ask for?!?  Looking forward to next time!
