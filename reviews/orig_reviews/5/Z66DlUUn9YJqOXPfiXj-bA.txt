The food here is the best the tacos comes with guacamole,picadillo, choice of meat and sour cream soft tortilla over a crunchy tortilla is so good. The tostada de camarones is good with lots of flavor. The employees are super nice very good service. When we come here to vegas this is our MUST!! Stop :-)
