As a fellow New Mexican, we are always excited to see the Zia Symbol.  We tried Chile Addiction and it was AWESOME. A great taste of home for sure! I had the red enchiladas stacked with an egg and my husband had the carne adovada. Both were absolutely delicious.  The service was amazing and the owners sat and talked with us for a while. Super welcoming and very good food!
