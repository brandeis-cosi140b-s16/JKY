I'm sad that the average rating for this place is low... it was simply spectacular.

On honeymoon in Scottsdale, we seeked above all a good mexican restaurant.    It took three tries before we found Frank & Lupes.     I had Frank's enchilada plate and it was WONDERFUL.     We ordered sour cream on the side and that made it perfect.

Our only suggestion to management:    the 'dessert' (sopatilla?) is so so much better hot - why not bring it out at the end of the meal instead of with the rest of the food?

We only found this place by stumbling past it and smelling the incredible aromas - what is the matter with you yelpers???   This is clearly five star (budget) mexican!
