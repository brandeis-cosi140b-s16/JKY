We ordered the $55 tasting option & we were so happy we did! It was the perfect amount (we were all stuffed though) and the selection was delicious. They brought out the best of the best, including homemade churros! Everything was timed perfectly & the service was excellent. Margs were also delish. I would consider this to be more of a casual restaurant, nothing too fancy. Would def go back.
