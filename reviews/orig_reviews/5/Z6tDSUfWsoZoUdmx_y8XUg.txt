This place is amazing! Just writing this review is making me hungry. First, the ambiance is awesome. The decor is fun and trendy and they play great music. It is a fantastic place to just relax and grab a bite with friends. The staff are all friendly and the customer service is great. They're quick to refill your drinks and if anything is wrong with your order (only happened to us once, forgot the enchilada sauce on a burrito) they are quick to fix it. 

We ordered a taco trio (carne asada, chicken tinga, & Baja fish) they were all fantastic but the carne asada was by far the favorite. The bomb black beans that came with the tacos were amazing! Seriously, for something as simple as black beans they were so tasty. My husband got The Beast burrito enchilada style with red and green sauce. That was delicious too. The Pork Adobado Torta was absolutely amazing! Makes my mouth water just thinking about it. The toasted bread was perfect with the saucy meat and the side salad that came with it was a perfect light complement to the heaviness of the sandwich. 

All in all, an awesome place, can't say enough great things about it! Can't wait to go back and try something new. If the trend continues, I'm sure whatever I pick from the menu next will be stellar.
