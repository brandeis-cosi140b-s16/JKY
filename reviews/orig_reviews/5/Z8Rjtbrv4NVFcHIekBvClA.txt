LOVE Lulu's!  Once I get a hankering for some Lulu's I have to go.  My favorite is the cheese quesadilla on a flower tortilla, chips and salsa and a strawberry margarita.  My husband gets regular tacos, nothing fancy, but he loves them!  Great food and I always head home with leftovers.  The churros are pretty good too!
