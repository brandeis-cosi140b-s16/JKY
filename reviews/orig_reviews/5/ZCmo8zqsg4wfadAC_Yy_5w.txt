I was in need for a cator for my baby's baptism. I was looking on the internet and I found Abuela's Tacos, I spoke with owner and she gave me a great reasonable price. This which included rice, beans, a choose of meat, tortillas, and sides to go on the tacos. It came buffet style with warmers and everything. She set it up and it was ready to be self-served. I highly recommend Abuela's Tacos for catoring.
