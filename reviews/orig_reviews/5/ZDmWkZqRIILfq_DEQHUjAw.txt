My favorite restaurant in CU 
I recommend the volcanes. They're like a tostada but with this nice grilled melted cheese on the tostada shell.
My bf (from mx) loves their tortas ahogadas and says he feels like he's back in mexico when we go there.

I love their beautiful tile counter/bar with tiles from mexico. :)
