This review is mostly because it was the best customer service experience I have ever had. When our order called for fresh avocado and they didn't have any, they didn't tell us they were out - the owner went to the grocery store to get some.  It made it take a few extra minutes, but it was awesome of them to do so.  When we asked them about where we could go to get cash without an ATM card, they made a way for us to get it themselves.  They allowed us to customize our order to mix and match two of the salad options without the least bit of acting annoyed that we were going off the menu a bit. 

All our service was from the owners, and I was happy to do my bit to support a great local small business while traveling through Las Vegas. 

The food was good, and very affordable, and the portions were huge. Fried ice cream was delicious and enormous.  I would have liked some more flavor in the chicken and the dressing, but ordering a chicken salad, I wasn't expecting the most exciting meal of my life. And the service was so amazing, it puts this review over the top.
