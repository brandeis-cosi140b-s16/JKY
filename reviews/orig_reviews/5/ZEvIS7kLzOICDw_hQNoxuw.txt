Great place! I have been holding off going there from my "Longboards" hangover! Longboards was the previous establishment and I loved it. Just discovered it too late (a few months before it closed). :)
Anyways, parking was easy! Is it like most places uptown, in regards to parking? Yes! You just have to be patient! They do offer FREE valet, so that's good ! The decor inside is cool! Johnny Cash cool! Loved the barrel tables! We sat at the bar! I saw a nice mixture of people in the crowd. I disagree that one of the previous reviews said "holy hipster"! 
The bartenders (all three ) were very attentive! Cobra is a sweetheart! They have my favorite beer, Sol, in bottles and it's only $3 per! A great start! Cobra was very helpful in making food recommendations! The  queso is outstanding! The best I've ever had! The previous review said otherwise! I totally disagree! It was awesome! Tacos were very good, too! We had 2 beers, sangria, queso, tacos and were stuffed! And the bill was only $27! We will be back! Great place, great food, great ambience and decor and even better bartenders!
