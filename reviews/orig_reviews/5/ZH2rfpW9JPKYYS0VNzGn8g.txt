We came back after the March Against Monsanto, Chef Paco was there and after the march at the market he made some amazing guacamole and we promised we would come, not that we need to make that promise, this place is good.

We brought some friends who had never been here before and what can I say.  The service was a little sketchy, but overall the experience was very good as expected.  

We had some table side guacamole and it was prepared perfectly like Chef Paco says it should.  The garlic in first and crushed then the avocado and on to the rest of the ingredients.

Our friend ordered the wings which I have never had here before but he said they were really good.  Two of us had the Mexican Burger and OMG, it was AMAZING, the flavors, cooked a little more towards medium well versus medium, but it was ok.  

This is an another amazing place and the ONLY I have found in Vegas with NON GMO ingredients and its open 24/7, can you say WHAT????

Amazing food at a place which is 100% transparent right in the front of the menu letting you know where things come from and its open 24/7, you cannot loose here...maybe on service but not on food.
