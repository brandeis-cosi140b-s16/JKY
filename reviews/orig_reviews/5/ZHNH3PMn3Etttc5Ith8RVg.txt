I came here for lunch today with a group of coworkers.  This Los Dos is pretty big and it was not packed at all for lunch.  Our server was friendly and prompt.  He brought us our chips and salsa right away which of the 2 salsas I really liked the green... It was spicy, but not too spicy.  I think over the course of our lunch I did drink a pitcher of water, but I wasn't uncomfortable or anything;).  I had the 2 ground beef taco's lunch special with a side of guacamole it also came with rice and beans.  They were your basic taco's but still very good.  One of my coworkers got the pasole and that looked pretty tasty to me.  I will definitely have to try that next time, pasole is one of my favorite soups... and it is hard to find places that make it well.
