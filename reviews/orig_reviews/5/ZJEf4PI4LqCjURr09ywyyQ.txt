I love this restaurant.  The ambiance was perfect and the food was amazing. I had the shrimp tacos with rice and beans.  It was very filling and full of flavor.  Even the rice was amazing. We also ordered the guacamole and they can make it as spicy as you want.  For dessert, we ordered churros. They were fresh, warm and delicious and came with dipping sauce.  I love Mexican food and this place exceeded my expectations. You can't go wrong here. I cant wait to go back.
