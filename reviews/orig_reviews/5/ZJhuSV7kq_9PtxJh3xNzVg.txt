This was my first experience here and I absolutely love it! We came on a Sunday afternoon and it happens to be happy hour which is always a good thing. We had the house margs and they were amazing and cheap. I ordered the chicken enchiladas which had a nice twist and my boyfriend had 3 different tacos which he loved. Overall we recommend the enchiladas over the tacos. Also our waiter was super friendly and helpful with the menu! LOVE it and will be back!
