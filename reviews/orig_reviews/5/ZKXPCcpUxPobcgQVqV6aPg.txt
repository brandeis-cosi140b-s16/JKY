Went there for the first time, was very impressed. 

It's a little dark inside but that didn't bother us. We ordered the seafood enchiladas, shrimp ceviche, and mango margarita. All three were delicious. 

The only thing we didn't like was the queso fundido, the chorizo was more like a paste and the cheese was a little too oily. 

Overall, would definitely come back.
