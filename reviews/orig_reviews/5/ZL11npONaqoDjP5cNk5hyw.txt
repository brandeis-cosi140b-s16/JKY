Awesome, awesome, awesome! Food is phenomenal and the guac is worth ordering. Won't be disappointed! I have now been there twice and cant wait to go back again. Torta: awesome. Tacos: awesome. Chicken dish thing that I cant remember the name?: awesome. boxed up what we didnt eat, and forgot it on the table. The server ran out to the road as we were driving to give it to us...are you kidding me? how sweet is that? go. now.
