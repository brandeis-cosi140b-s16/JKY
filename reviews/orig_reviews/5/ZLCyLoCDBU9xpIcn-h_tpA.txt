I moved from the west valley to the FAR east valley about a year ago. This would have been a sad, sad time for me... saying goodbye to the west valley Chino that I have grown to love and adore. But after I tried this location, I knew life would go on.
   Everything I eat here, I love. This place is just awesome and fun and you must try the jerk fried rice!
