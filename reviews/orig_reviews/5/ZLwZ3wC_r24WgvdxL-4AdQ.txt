Second time at Mangos in as many years. Again it was excellent. Nothing unique, just really good, fresh Mexican food. Similar to Macayo's but with a great "hole in the wall" setting. I chose to sit outdoors on a beautiful December night. Simple 2 cheese enchilada combo meal was overflowing on my plate, hot and tasty. Amazing chips and salsa come with the meal. Fast and friendly service.
