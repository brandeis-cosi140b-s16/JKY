Sunday brunch at Barrio is something i always look forward to. the atmosphere is cute as can be. the artwork is always interesting.  and the food is really something special. so today i am out with family to sunday brunch. 

my favorite thing is the coffee, I'm a huge fan of french press, and the coffee is unbelievable. i ordered the huevos con chorizo. very tasty. the chorizo is semi spicy. accompanying the eggs and chorizo are the potatoes. very tasty. waxy potatoes steamed till tender and then i think pan cooked real quick with some seasoning. how ever they are cooked they are very good. we also ordered the guacamole. typically if you get dinner guacamole they prepare it at the table for you. brunch..they bring you a bowl of it prepared in the kitchen. no complaints here. i just like it anyway i get it. very very spicy with a hint of sweet from the cranberries they toss in. always satisfied when i leave barrio.

they open at 11:00am for sunday brunch and expect a line. at both entrances. show up after 11...expect a line. 
either way its worth showing up for.

I've eaten dinner here a few times, which i will leave another review the next time i go. for now i think the brunch deserves 5 stars.
