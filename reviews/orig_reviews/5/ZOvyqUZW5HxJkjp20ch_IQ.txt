After getting food poisoning at Tacos El Gordo I paused on eating tacos for a minute which sucks cuz I REALLY LOVE TACOS! Anyways this place is by my bf's house and we decided to try it out...

Words cannot describe how savory and delicious these tacos are! Even the burritos are big and fat and fulfilling! I LOVED EVERY single bite! Even my boyfriend stopped eating at Tacos El Gordo! I love that it's a little hidden treasure lol (I was always got annoyed from how busy Tacos El Gordo got busy) but yes! Do try it!! Plus the staff are so cute & nice!!! Reminds me of my elderly relatives!!! :-) thumbs up!! Fresh tacos!!!
