First off, this place, from the outside looks like a total hole in the wall. But don't let that fool you, it totally is. The staff there though, is amazing. Short staffed and crowded they managed to fit- and serve - 25 people at the drop of a hat. We made the reservation just a couple hours before and were at the restaurant for no more than an hour and a half. Which is amazing for a party that size.

I had the steak burrito which was amazing. It gave chipotle a run for their money in my book. My girlfriend had the Grigo Beef Tacos and said they were really good as well: "beef tacos can be really bland sometimes and it can be difficult to spruce them up. This place did a great job at doing just that." Another person at the table had the pancake taco which was "different, but good".

The atmosphere was very nice. Laid back, loud and just generally fun; following the rock history, tex-mex decor. The walls are (spray?) painted with various rock musicians from Ozzy to Bob Marley.
