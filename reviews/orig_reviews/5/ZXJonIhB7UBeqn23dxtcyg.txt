Really awesome place tucked in the middle of the World Market Center. What a find!! The atmosphere is very unique and early in the evening they weren't slammed like everything else in Vegas. Great gracious staff and plenty of easy parking.
Now the food, WOW! The richest and most flavorful salsa I have ever had, period! 

Tried the queso flameado with corn tortillas and the chips, very flavorful and a great value.

The piece de resistance was the prime filet mignon. This was a fabulous filet that was cooked perfect medium. The char was second to none I've had some Burn's in Tampa. Marry this with the sauces and add the mushrooms and you are in for a culinary experience. A refined palette will appreciate this Vegas prize.

If you like Mexican and are willing to explore it with a unique twist, definitely don't miss Mundo.
