It was my first time in Lindo Michoacan and the service was excellent. Our order was taken promptly and food came out quickly.The waiter stop by often to check in with us.The food taste so good I was surprised that they make fresh guacamole if you wanted some. Overall this place was really good and I would defiantly go back again. :)
