Killer.  Great salsa, chips and stuff.  Packed on a Friday 7pm.  30 min wait....but well worth it.  Bar area was busy and looks like a good spot to hang out and watch the game.

Had the....

Beef fajitas - amazing.

Cheese enchiladas - awesome.  Great red sauce.

Tacos el Pastor - close second to Tacos el Gordo.  Different, but amazingly awesome.

And last, but not least, service was great.
