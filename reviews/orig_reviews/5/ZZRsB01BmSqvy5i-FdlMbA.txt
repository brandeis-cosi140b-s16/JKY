I've been reading and hearing a lot of good things about Dos Hippies Beach house and let me tell you, it was amazing.  I got three tacos, chicken, pork & carne asada.  All of them wrapped in a warm panini grilled style flour tortilla (corn if you want) and stuffed with fresh meat and organic vegies.   Accompanying them was some salsa verde and regular red salsa, both were super flavorful and I assume home made.  3 tacos was too much for me but I devoured them all.  The pork aka carnitas was my favorite.  Next time I plan to try out their burritos or quesadillas.  This is place is excellent and affordable.  The scenery is cool, reminds me of a place I used to eat at in Ocean Beach when I lived in San Diego.  It's a must try!!!!!  Nice work Two Hippies...you've got something good going!
