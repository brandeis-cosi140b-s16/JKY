This is one of those Yelp finds that lives up to its hype. A little dumpy dive in the depressed west Vegas burbs. I wasn't expecting much. Oh man, the food was really good, really unique, and cheap. Had tacos, tostada, etc.. They bring a salsa spinner to the table, and it's all excellent. And at the end, you get a fresh, cold orange for dessert.
