I tried going to other taco places to search for the best, but I just keep coming back here. If In N Out is to burgers then Tacos El Gordo is the champion of all taquerias in LV. Simple, delicious, no-frills menu. You can't get better than this. 

Since my last review I've been here numerous times and I always order the same thing: CABEZA, ADOBADA, and LENGUA. If you have not tried these yet, please, step away from your carne asada and discover the sheer pleasure of these juicy, flavorful meats. Out of this world delicious!!!
