Paz was a pretty awesome taco eating experience.  The place has cool art everywhere, the staff was extremely friendly, and their taco's were super amazing.  And if you love flan, I highly highly recommend you try this places, it was out-of-this-world.  

I also got a chance to meet the owner, who was really nice and down-to-earth.  I witnessed him helping a few customers out by serving them himself. Talk about having a heart of service.  Five stars, I totally recommend this place!

P.S, there are outside activities like ping pong and corn hole, which I thought added a cool, relaxed, fun-filled vibe, making a great place to hang out for a couple of hours.
