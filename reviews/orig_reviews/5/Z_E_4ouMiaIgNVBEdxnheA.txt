This place is worth every bit of this five star rating. The prices are good and more importantly the food is delicious. The free nachos and salsas make it even better. 

You can't really go wrong with whatever you get here whether it's a burrito or fajita--it all tastes authentic and way better than any of the other campus restaurants serving Mexican food. Wait times aren't bad and the staff is friendly as well. If there's a place where you want to be known as a "regular", this one's it.
