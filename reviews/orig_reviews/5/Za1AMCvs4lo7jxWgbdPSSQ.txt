Awesome! Service was great! Ambiance was great! Food was amazing! Highly recommend: crispy fish taco, braised beef taco and shrimp ceviche. This might be my new favorite spot!

One thing I would change, is I would love for these tacos to be a crispy shell. The soft was good, but crispy would have been the BEST (for most tacos, not all). Maybe the option to choose???
