Yum! This place is consistently good and one of the only two Mexican places that I like almost everything on the menu. Shrimp & crab enchiladas? Delicious. Service is good. I've gotten one weird waiter once or twice that likes to point at you with his pen when taking your order which bothers me. But people are weird, everywhere. I'm a frequent customer.
