Carlito's is a very unique restaurant with familiar items on the menu.  The new mexican cuisine is based on mexican food, but with inspirations from native american and southern cuisines.  I have been here many times, and have many favorites on the menu.  The carlito's burrito is a large burrito with only meat, and red or green chile.  The grilled steak burrito with green chile is my favorite.  The green chile is bold and flavorful, and the steak is grilled fresh to order and cut into big, tender slices.  
The tacos are another favorite of mine.  I usually get the grilled steak tacos, but the chicken and the ground beef are also very good.  The tacos are fried slightly to make the tortilla crispy.  The only criticism of the tacos is that they are served with a very small amount of salsa.  
The specials at Carlito's are also very cool.  Tuesdays is Taco Tuesday where they serve tacos for only a buck.  They have an everyday special for their Carlito's Beer which is also only a buck.  Their best special, though, is on saturdays.  Every saturday they serve a 10 oz. Ribeye Steak with cheese, green chile, mashed potatoes, and calabacitas (squash, corn, and tomato succotash).  This ribeye is only 10.95.  
Overall, if you enjoy unique new mexican cuisine, you should definitely try carlito's.
