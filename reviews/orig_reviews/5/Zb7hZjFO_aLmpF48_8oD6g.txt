Had an amazing early dinner yesterday on one of the most awesome patios. It was cozy with a wonderful fountain. I was craving a taco and ended up having the daily special... a taco, enchilada beans and rice for $4.99! Their house margaritas are only $1.99 I had a fantastic server named Wesley who I learned will be leaving soon to the Air Force. I'm sure he will be missed as part of the Arribas crew... thank you for your service Wesley!
