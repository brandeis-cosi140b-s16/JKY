Best tacos in Las Vegas. And I've tried quite a few.

While El Gordo is the big name joint, I think Taco Tijuana is better for two reasons. One is freshness: for some reason El Gordo's taste a little old, while Taco Tijuana is always juicy and tender and amazing. They have the same style and menu, so the nuance of preparation is key. The second is portion. Taco Tijuana tacos are MUCH larger, bursting with more meat, than their competition. I was disappointed by the skinny taco I got at El Gordo last time. You get double your money at this place, so it's become my go to, and I figured it was time I wrote them a much due review. The staff is friendly as well.

Al Pastor, Cabeza, Lengua, and Buche are my favorites, in that order.
