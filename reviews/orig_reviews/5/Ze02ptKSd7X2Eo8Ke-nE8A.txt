I'll say it, I like Nacho Daddy. Come at me bro. 

Look, we are all adults here. Nacho Daddy is a novelty joint with the name "Nacho Daddy"- what is up with these negative reviews that are like "the menu is primarily nachos, not a lot of variety". Um, that's not a problem with the menu, the problem is you suck. 

Things I have had that are good

-Cuban. I mean, not really an actual cuban, but a good sandwich nevertheless.
-Wings- shockingly good. Really good blue cheese to boot
-Queso- OMG WHITE QUESO I'M SO HAPPY
-Burger Nachos- basically chips, cheese, and ground beef... so 10/10 would bang
-Sliders- I didn't actually get to eat any of these as my dining companion killed them all. Looked good though.
-Pork Tacos- I'm not ashamed to admit these were insanely good. Caramelized onions on top, some kind of delicious sauce, pretty pretty pretty good

I have never actually been in there because I live 5 feet away and order it from postmates cause ballin, but I would assume the decor was subtle and sophisticated.
