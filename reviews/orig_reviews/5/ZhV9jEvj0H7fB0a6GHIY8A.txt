For any poor basterd who thinks that "the Crazy Chicken" is good, i say try this chicken who isnt so crazy (or expensive) and your sox will be rocked!
El Pollo grabs el pollo loco by the throat and stangles it into submission. if these two restaurants were in a cock fight you'd be foolish to place your money on the corporate backed "crazy" bird!
Previous Yelpers have summed it up pretty nicely; The charbroiled red skinned chicken is roasted to perfection and the carne asada is grilled but not so much to make it tough, retaining its lovely hue of pink in the middle. 
The combo plate is by far your best choice, giving you the advantage of both their delicious cow and bird meat on the same plate with accoutrements of sauteed red onions, pinto beans, and a uniquely homemade salsa fresca. Your choice of flour or corn tortilla.
The chicken is unlike any other i have had, the skin is crispy and delicious and a crimson colour which screams eat me!
If you've ever stepped outside of cartel and thought to yourself "what is that mesmorizing aroma!?"
that my friend is El Pollo tantalizing you to step on in and have a wonderfully homecooked meal for under $10
Beat that El Pollo Loco!
