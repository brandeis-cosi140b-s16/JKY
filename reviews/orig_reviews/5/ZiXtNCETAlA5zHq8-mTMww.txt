I recently had friends in town and they were staying at Planet Hollywood and wanted to eat at the hotel. So we went to Yolos and couldn't have been more pleased! From the hostess to the bartender everyone was on top of their game! I had the chicken tacos and they were delicious! We also ordered gaucamole which had just the right about of heat to it! My friends had the steak nachos which is done a little different than most people and they loved them!! Also we all drank margarita's and they were some of the best ones I have had in a long time. Nadjana was the bartender and she was so nice and friendly! She attended to all our needs! I will definitely come back because I always have friends in town that stay on the strip!!! They also told us that they had just remodeled and the place looked great!!
