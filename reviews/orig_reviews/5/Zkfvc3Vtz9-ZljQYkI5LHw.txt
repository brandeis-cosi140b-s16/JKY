I love Javier's out in Orange County so was so happy to find out they had one here in Vegas..my mother sister & I went on cinco de mayo..service was great (wish I could remember our servers name) we always get the same thing because it is SOOO good that we can never switch it up, chicken nachos, trio enchiladas (which are lobster, shrimp, and crab) and the house margaritas! Must try!
