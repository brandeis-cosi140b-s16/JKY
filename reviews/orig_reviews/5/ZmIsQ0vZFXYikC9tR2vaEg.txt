Los Reyes de la Torta has the best Mexican sandwich as advertised. The deluxe torta with a lime agua fresca is just about all you need when you're hungry and want some great food. Not fancy, but it's clean, the people are friendly, the kitchen is open (and again, clean) and best of all the food is really good. The interplay between the meats on the torta are wonderful. The place doesn't look like much from 7th Street - in fact we drove right past it the first time - but turn in and enjoy. Highly recommended.
