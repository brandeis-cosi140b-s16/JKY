WOW! This place is good. I found a 2nd favorite Burrito place. My favorite is Carlito's Burritos but this place ranks right up there. Its a little cute place and gives off the home feel when you walk in. They have a basic menu, Tacos, Burritos, Quesadillas, Carne Asada Fries, Nachos and etc. Very clean and they even make the tortillas fresh. The staff is very friendly. Had the Chicken Burrito with rice, beans, cheese and pico de gallo. So damn good. I had to stop myself from inhaling it. I wanted to enjoy it. My wife had the Carne Asada Nachos. Them and the Carne Asada Fries are among the best in town. Just every layer has so much meat, cheese, beans, and im guessing they use Mexican Crema instead of regular sour cream. So dang addicting. We been there a couple times and we keep going back to what he had even though we keep saying we gonna try something different lol. If your tired of Roberto's i say give this place a try. Nice to have a place that has food that tastes like mom or in this case, Grandma makes :-) Until next time, Let's Eat!!!
