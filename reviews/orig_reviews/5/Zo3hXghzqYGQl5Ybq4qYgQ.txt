Not much to say here, except that, in a town full of mexican restaurants (some good, many mediocre), these are the best tortas.  And the family who manages it couldn't be nicer every time I go there.

I always recommend this place...I've even taken business clients there, even though it's a order-at-the-counter type of restaurant.
