My wife and I went to Isabel's Amor last night, just because we were in the area and decided to try someplace new. We were rewarded with one of the best meals we have had out in a long time. The restaurant was very warm and inviting, and the staff friendly and welcoming. The service was attentive and pleasant. 

We ordered the House Made Pico De Avacado, which was a delicious citrus flavored avocado dip. I had the Chile Verde, and loved every bite. The meat was tender and flavorful. The rice is very good and the refried beans were some of the best I have ever had. My wife had the Poblano Chile Relleno, which was delicious. 

The price was very good for the quality we received. We will be returning to try other menu items, no question. I would highly recommend this restaurant.
