Have been eating here since Guy Fieri had it on his show, Diners Drive-ins and Dives, but have failed to Review this extraordinary little place, only a mile from my home. Maybe subconsciously I wanted to keep it to myself. Of course, with over 200 Reviews here they do NOT need mine, unless you want to know a secret.

THE SECRET: Having fallen in love with Tacos Pastor (and Mexican Coca Cola) at Asadero Norte De Sonora   (See my Previous Review) three visits ago I asked if they served Tacos Pastor (they are NOT on the menu) and one of the beautiful sisters advised that they did indeed. Oh my word! Nirvana, so close to home (Asadero Norte De Sonora is ten miles away). I knew I would be in trouble.

They are little (The Tacos) here, but have three or four and you will think you are in Heaven. The morsels of Pork are just right spicy and absolutely delicious! Wash them down with Coca Cola from Mexico and call it FABULOUS! 

Prior to discovering Tacos Pastor I hade been VERY happy with the Carne Asada Tacos and as good as they are, NOT close to Tacos Pastor!

Do NOT miss this wonderful treat!
