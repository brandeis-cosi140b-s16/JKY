I would give this place 4 stars for the fact that my burrito seems to increase by $1.25 when adding potatoes to it...ridiculous. However, they have THE best chile relle√±o burrito you'll ever consume...I'm pretty sure my co-workers would concur. Also, there's a guy that works the cash register that provides THE BEST customer experience, period. I can't believe this guy is working at Los Favs. If you own a local restaurant and happen to read this, you should seriously consider offering this man a job! I literally looked him in the eye as I was leaving and let him know that he has a great attitude. Amazing burritos and superior customer service...kinda weird saying that about a fast food burrito shop :P keep up the stellar work guys, and gals!
