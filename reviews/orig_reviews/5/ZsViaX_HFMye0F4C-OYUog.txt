First time at this place and was glad I stopped in on my way back home (Utah). 
I was greeted the minute I walked in by both employees on the line. Carmelo (sp?) gave us about 30 seconds before asking questions and giving us information on the items to choose, the way Braddah's works, the extra cost of things so I'm not surprised at the end of my ordering. If I say I've never been to an establishment, it's probably good to ask the customer questions to uncover their wants/needs to help them along and Carmelo did just that. She was very friendly and didn't have a "I hate my life" look or attitude that you get from many people working in the food industry. I was offered samples of the meat to assist I choosing the one I want for my soon to be amazing burrito. I used a Yelp coupon for the coconut bark which was BOMB. That thing is crack in bag. My burrito was under $10, got free bark, free samples, great service and I was full and ready for a nap by the time I was done. Note to self: Do not drive eating your burrito. You will drop rice on the floor and your shirt and you will be tired because you ate the whole thing because the guac and sour cream combo tasted so good with the meats and nori rice.
