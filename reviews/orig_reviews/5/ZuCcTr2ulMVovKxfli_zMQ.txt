First things first The Blue Adobe Grille is a New Mexican food joint not to be confused with Mexican food- totally different! I love both, but there is something about the heavy influence of ancho & green chili that drives me back again and again! I have been multiple times and yet to a bad experience, even when I had a bad experience! Confused? Let me clear air-
   Headed out on the town one evening with wifey, we decide to start the night @ Blue Adobe. We started off with a few drinks and then placed our order, few more drinks down the hatch. The waitress walks by and tells us just about 5 mins left, cool no prob! 5 mins more she comes by apologizes and tells us more mins, um ok. Next thing you know, there's a loud argument in the kitchen and the owner (who has been bussing tables, playing hostess, & well just all out helping her staff) comes to the table and tells us the cooks lost our order, What???? She then apologizes and tells us our plates are next and tells us dinner is on her. Ok that's cool, we have all been there and any place with tact will do that, but we've been drinking and as we all know that adds up quick especially with shots! So when we get the bill, she had taken care of everything, I was shocked, she had come back by several times to apologize and thank us for coming in. That was the only bad experience we've had and it still turned out awesome! A owner that cares about the customer+ class + great food = a 5 star great place to eat!
