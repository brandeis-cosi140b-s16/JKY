For my money one of two or three best Mexican restaurants in the valley. Work downtown eat lunch out 5 days a week. Always go here at least once a week. Some of the best green and red chili I have ever had. Also great beans made with bacon grease. Also has menudo and posole which are wonderful. Try this joint do not let the appearance or location scare you a way.
