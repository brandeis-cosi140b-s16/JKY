I love this place! Great food and great service. The green salsa is terrific with fresh chips. I usually get one of three things: filete a la plancha (grilled fish), tacos al gobernador (shrimp tacos) or the fish ceviche. The shrimp cocktail and shrimp culiche (baked in green sauce with cheese) are also amazing. I've been coming to this place for years, and the quality is always outstanding.  I'm just a bit surprised that it isn't more crowded--with food this good, you'd think people would be flocking here!
