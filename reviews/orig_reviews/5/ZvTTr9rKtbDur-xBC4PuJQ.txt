Review of the Enchilada Verde....Really good! I had not tried it yet but I still like the Mole better but not all people like Mole. We went on Saturday night and right now the Mojito is the special and I won't say it was bad but stick with Mexican drinks! Guac was very good. 

A note to people...I took the hubby and he is not and adventurous eater. He thought it was ok but I had gotten him tacos to go before and loved them. He did Fajitas this time and said they were a little bland. BUT he was too scared to try the green avocado salsa that is amazing. His loss. 

So as said before...if you think think taco bell is typical Mexican food than this may not be the place for you. 

BUT I think we have established that the Tacos here are for everyone!
