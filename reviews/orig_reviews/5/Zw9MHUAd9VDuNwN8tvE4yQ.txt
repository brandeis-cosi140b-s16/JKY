What a great concept and place to eat! It was our first time visiting Gadzooks and didn't know what to expect. We were greeted by Jessica who was so friendly and walked us through the entire process. All of the staff there were so nice, helpful and friendly that I will be back because of their great service and good food! Even the other customers were so nice, giving us advise on what to get! We sampled many sauces and toppings! We can't wait to visit again and try new combinations!
