UPDATE, June 2015:  Julia's has become an almost weekly stop now, just can't get enough!  One of the most amazing things they do is allow customers to sample the various meat options before deciding.  And this makes it even HARDER to choose!  You'll want them all, and you are simply forced to return to try them all. Super delicious food!
-----------------------------
Have eaten @ Julia's 4 or 5 times now, and they never disappoint!! If you're looking for a Mexican restaurant that has FLAVORFUL MEAT, look no further.

Beef,  pork & chicken are mesquite grilled, providing a fabulous aroma that greets you in the parking lot. Chile verde pork & pollo adobado are favorites. Choose how you want to enjoy these meats--in tacos, a burrito, in a salad, or simply as a meat plate with beans & rice.

Haven't tried breakfast yet, but they serve it! They also, surprisingly, serve hotdogs & hamburgers,  I guess for your friends who don't like Mexican food but want to hang with you!
