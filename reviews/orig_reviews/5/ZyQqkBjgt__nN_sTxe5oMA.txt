I had an awesome diner here this evening. The food was awesome and the waiter was very warm and friendly.

This family restaurant makes authentic southwestern food.  The hand made corn tortilla's were excellent as was the entire meal.  The proprietors family has been making this food for generations and the restaurant is full of their memorabilia.
