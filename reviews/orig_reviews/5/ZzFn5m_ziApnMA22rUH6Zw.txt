Probably some of the best tacos I've ever had outside of Los Angeles or Mexico. The key here is the homemade tortillas. Dear God they were wonderful and delicious. Tacos are on the cheap $2/each and you gotta love the free drink refills (including Horchata, Jamaica, Tamarindo). Have a huge selection of meats including chorizo. Everything was fresh and the cooks and staff were incredibly helpful and accommodating. Would definitely be back when I'm in Vegas. Another plus? Open until 4am!!!
