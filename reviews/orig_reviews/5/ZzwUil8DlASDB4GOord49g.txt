Had the table side guac, pork shoulder tacos, roasted corn, and black bean side. All very good. At first I thought the pork taco serving was small for two people but once you add it to the small corn tortillas and other toppings its plenty. Service was excellent we were seated outside under a heat lamp and someone came over and placed a cloth napkin on the ground where my purse was to protect it. Drinks were my only disappointment but since this is based on personal preference I still gave 5 stars. The mojito mint was not muddled and the wine selections were limited. I tried three different drinks and none really wowed me but the food more than made up for it.
