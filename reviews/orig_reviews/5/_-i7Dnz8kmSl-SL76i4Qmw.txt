Taco y Taco is probably one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas: I'm a psuedo regular, and there at the very least bi-weekly if not weekly.

It occupies that perfect space between Tacos el Gordo- authentic, gloriously affordable real non-tex-mex tacos you can't really get outside of the southwest, and Mercadito- fancier riffs on said authentic glory for a premium price. 

The tacos there are SO good, and SO cheap...its easy to justify coming back again and again and again. And the fun, clean atmosphere make it easy to lure your "Chipotle only" friends and family into experiencing real mexican.

If you come here for the first time, do yourself a huge favor. Grow a pair. Be adventurous. Don't order the chicken. Try lengua, or suadero! You will be amazed at what you have been missing out on. The carnitas and Al pastor are pretty goddamn amazing, if you need a comfort blanket, but try something from window 2 you're not sure you'll like. At worst, you waste 2 bucks.  

At best you open up a Wide and Wonderful World of Offal... 

Oh, and lest I forget; Delerium Tremens on tap (you heard me, tap.) and a house Margarita that features jalapeno infused tequila. And corn! Get the corn! And the Guacamole---oh hell just go. Often.
