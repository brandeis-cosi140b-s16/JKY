Viva Michoacan has amazing food for amazing value. We went there for brunch on the weekend and got chips, salsa, beans, soup, quesadillas, and choice of several entrees including chiliquilles, Mexican eggs, chorizo with eggs, and a few more all that came with rice and beans all for $14.99. The abondigas soup had great meatballs and the pozole had pork on the bone with gave it wonderful depth of flavor. The quesadilla was sooooo good, the flour tortilla was freshly made and it had the white Mexican cheese which I can't seem to find anywhere. The chiliquilles were pretty good and so was the chorizo with eggs. I night recommend this place. Great value for great food.
