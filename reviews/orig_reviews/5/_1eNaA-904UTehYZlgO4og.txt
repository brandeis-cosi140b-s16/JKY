I don't think I have ever scarfed so many tacos down my throat in so little amount of time before in my life. These were some of the best tacos that I've ever had. The meats are so juicy and have so much flavor, and there are so many to choose from. I love how you can build your own tacos and customize them whichever way you'd like, and if you're not sure which meats you want, they allow to sample each an every one of them.
The servers were incredibly friendly, and the prices are great for what you get.
Amazing food. Amazing place.
