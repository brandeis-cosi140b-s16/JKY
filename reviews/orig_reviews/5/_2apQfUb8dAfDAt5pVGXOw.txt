Starts off you off with free unlimited chips that is served with guacamole and salsa.. Delicious! It is definitely worth the price of the tacos. I ordered the bulgogi, daegigogi, and the asada tacos. Definitely worth the price. Each taco was $1.29 and it was very delicious. After your meal they give you a half sliced orange as a dessert.   Their service was perfect, the food was excellent, and the price was incredibly low for what you get. I will definitely come back for more.
