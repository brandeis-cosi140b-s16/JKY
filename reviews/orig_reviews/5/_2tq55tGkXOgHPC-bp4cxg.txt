First off, HOORAY for taco Tuesdays! I've been going to Joyride for months and months. For margaritas/drinks, for tacos, for burritos, and obviously for the music.. Whether it's a date night or with a bunch of friends, I always enjoy my drinks and food here. I've also always received excellent customer service both at tables and at the bar --on top of the delicious food. Especially tonight. 

Weird story.. another customer ended up pulling the garage door (which I love the concept of) down on my shoulder tonight because his wife was a bit chilly. The guy wasn't paying attention and the door ended up landing super hard my shoulder. For starters I am accident prone and it's something that would happen to me. IT WAS NOT ON THE STAFF AT ALL, buuuut they were SO kind and overly concerned. Our server and the manager went above and beyond to make sure all was good. I shrugged it off, but they did not. As if I could love the place any more... they outdid themselves tonight. Which doesn't surprise me.

Love it. Highly recommended. 110%!
