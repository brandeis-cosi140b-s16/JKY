Better than Chipotle? Si! I was very impressed with this place. Not only was the chicken fajita burrito delicious, the prices were very reasonable, and the staff is exceptionally kind. They give you complimentary chips and salsa while your food is being prepared, a variety of chips and salsas (the verde salsa is muy bueno). Lastly, they make some pretty good lemonade as well. Highly recommended.
