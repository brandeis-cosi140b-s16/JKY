Followed prior reviews and had the street tacos and was not disappointed as the El Pastor was excellent. Neil was an excellent waiter! Had the flan and it is as good as advertised! The deep fried ice cream was also good. Chef Paco makes a very nice presentation on your plate. He let us try his new creation of a cheesecake chimichanga with Mexican chocolate. Believe it will be a hit too! Hear they will have a Mariachi band on Tuesdays and Wine Down Wednesdays  that are 30% all wine and 1/2 off appetizers with live music. Give them a try!
