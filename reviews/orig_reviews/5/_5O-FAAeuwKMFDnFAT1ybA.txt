This place is amazing! 

I'm usually not a huge fan of Mexican cuisine, but this one is definitely done with taste and health in mind!!!

The salads are out of this world and come in soft tortilla, fresh veggies/lettuce, beans, authentic cheese, cilantro and choice of dressing (cilantro lime dressing is not only healthy it is also very yummy!)

I love their steaks as these are done right and often right in front of you on the grill. They also have a customer appreciation program where they stamp a frequent buyer card and you get your 10th item free!!! Also, each receipt comes with free coupon for chips and salsa.

Everything is so fresh here it became my favorite lunch spot anytime that I work on the West side. I highly recommend this place to those who enjoy this type of food and setting.

Decor is casual and clean. Prices are good for the volume that you do receive.
