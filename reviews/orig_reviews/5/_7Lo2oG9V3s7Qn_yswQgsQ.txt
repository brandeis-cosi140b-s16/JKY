bit of a line, but worth it. greatest tacos ever!!! especially since they are open 24/7. if you geat sick of the Vegas buffets and are fiending some o.g. tacos come here and gets some! they make their tortillas fresh right in front of you and hook you up some cooked scallions and chillis at a reasonable price. must go to in vegas.
