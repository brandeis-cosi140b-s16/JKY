Every year in the dead heat of summer I retreat to Hilton Squaw Peak and my first stop (after the lazy river of course) is Aunt Chilada's. Oh, the atmosphere, the history of the restaurant, the food and the friendly faces make me feel at home every time I am here. Whether it is sitting outside at the outdoor bar or seeking refuge in the air conditioning it is simply the best part of my trip. All I have to do is follow the painted chili peppers from Hilton ( I actually use them to get home if too much patron was consumed .....just kidding. I call the Hilton to have the golf cart pick us up! Duh! No, really that is available for hotel guests!) The fish tacos are the best I have ever had and I am a snob from California.  The salsa is southwest style and really good. Very good beans and rice and free buffets daily at happy hour. Who can complain! Bands on Fridays are fun too. Overall this is a gem in the desert. Always featured on Fox TV  and was also spotlighted on Drinking Made Easy. If you haven't been then you are missing out! Live. Love. Eat at Aunt Chilada's.
