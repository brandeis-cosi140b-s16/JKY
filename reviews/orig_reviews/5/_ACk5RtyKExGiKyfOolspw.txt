I crave the Mission daily! I have been quite a regular of this unique Latin American restaurant and cannot wait to go back and experience more dishes. I enjoy starting with the Cheese Plate. Let me tell you, this is no ordinary cheese plate. The dish is a mixture of Yucca bread, Peruvian aji, apples with warm honey, and more. Extremely tasty. I enjoyed the Almejas al Vapor (Peruvian seafood stew), skirt steak tacos, and now my new favorite pollo a la brasa. The chicken is marinated in red aji rocotto (spicy) and served on top of a mixture of french fries and sweet potato fries. 

The entire staff here is always knowledgeable and will make the best recommendation. Thank you Brian, one of the owners, for always making myself and my guests feel welcome.
