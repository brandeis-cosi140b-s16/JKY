The food is as good as everyone says it is...it's just another level here. Guacamole is a must- with the seasonal pomegranate seeds or without. Order the Cochinita Pibil and experience what Mexican food is like without a ton of yellow cheese melted on top of it. Enjoy the gorgeous art on the walls inside and outside of the restaurant.
