We used to live in this neighborhood and this was definitely one of our favorite places. Then we relocated and now we barely make it here once a year : (

We initially found this place because of an Entertainment Book coupon. I think they still have it (at least the 2013).

We do not drink so we cannot say about the margaritas, but we have a few favorite dishes here.

This time we noticed the bean dip was kind of runny, but it was still good.
Fresh chips, good salsa.

Hubby had the Arroz con Pollo, which comes with a creamy sauce.
I was adventurous and didn't order any of the usual.. I ordered Shrimp Las Glorias, which are the ones wrapped in bacon. They were really good, very crispy.

Some other times we have fajitas, sopa 7 mares, or tostadas de ceviche.
Service is very friendly, although this time we didn't recognize any of the ladies.

Hope to be back soon. : )
