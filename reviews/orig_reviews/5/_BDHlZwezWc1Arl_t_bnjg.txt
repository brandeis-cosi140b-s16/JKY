First off, I want to give a HUGE shoutout to server, Ty.  He is AMAZING! 

For ladies night on Thursday night, My boyfriend's aunt, mom, his brother's girlfriend and I like to get together and grab food and drinks together and try to win the amazing prize of the night.  Although none of us have ever won the beautiful purse or watch, we still love to come and catch up.

We all haven't gathered for a ladies night together in a few months and Ty remembered us and even remembered what we drank! That is very impressive and the type of service I love to receive.  He is very fast, friendly and always makes us feel special and welcomed.

I love the burger here! Sounds strange to order a burger at a Mexican restaurant, but trust me, you won't regret it!  The lobster jalapeno sauce that is served on the side is amazing to dip your fries in as well.

Ty was nice enough to bring us a complimentary dessert, which was a coconut flan. Delicious! The service and food keeps us coming back! One of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas.
