Rokerij is our never-fail for great food, a relaxed, cozy and unique experience just for two or for a group of good friends. The small bites plates are great to pass around, or if you just feel like grazing for your entire meal. Crab Louie salad is unreal - big enough to share. Fish specials are always tasty with well paired seasoning, chutney or sauces. The meat options are plentiful and hearty. We always have great service and a fantastic dining experience. One of my absolute favorite restaurants in Phoenix!
