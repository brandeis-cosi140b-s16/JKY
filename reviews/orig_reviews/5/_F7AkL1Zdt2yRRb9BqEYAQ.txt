Family and i and friends were visiting from the St. Louis area and were in the mood for some burgers so I found this place and it was off the chain amazing!! Lol.. The burgers were awesome, I had the paradise burger chz it was tasty! I never liked sweet potato fries BUT their sweet potato tots were to die for !! Over all this place was a great choice :-).. This is a must go when we come back to visit... Only thing is that I would take it to go, the place isn't really a din in .. Thanks for the great food we loved it!
