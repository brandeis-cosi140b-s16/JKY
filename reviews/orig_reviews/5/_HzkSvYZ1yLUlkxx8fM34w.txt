As you read this review, please keep in mind I am a conservative mother of two small children.

This place is so effing good.

Since moving to Phoenix two months ago, I have been in search of a down and dirty taco place, but one that didn't leave me feeling like I had just eaten a corn tortilla full of grease. This is that place. Authentic Mexican food with a gourmet twist. So so yummy.

I ordered the el gaucho steak taco and the cabo shrimp taco. Add in a $2 Negra Modelo, and life was good. If we didn't have two kids in tow, my husband and I could have kept ordering tacos and beer. 

Be prepared to go early, and the place is small...so seating is limited. Not good for large groups. 

Such a great place. If you aren't happy with your order here, then that just might be a personal problem. And I can't help you with that.
