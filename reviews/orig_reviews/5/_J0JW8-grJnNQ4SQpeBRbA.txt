Stopped in for a Cold drink during a walk and ended up having a Bloody Mary and the Roasted Garlic Plate. Phenomenal!  Bloody Mary was so good I had to order another.  Wasn't sure what to expect with the Garlic Plate and I still can't explain it other than phenomenal!  I'll be back for breakfast tomorrow!
