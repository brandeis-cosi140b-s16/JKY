I recently went in for dinner and was extremely pleased with El Dorado! Our server Neil was friendly, attentive and knowledgeable on the menu. He suggested the street tacos which were amazing! Later, my guest and I were greeted by Chef Paco who came out to see how we were doing, and how we were enjoying the meal. It was really nice to see a Chef who came out and table touched. I felt this really illustrated his passion for his product and ensured that his guests were pleased with his products! All of the food tasted so fresh and was presented beautifully! We will be back again to this incredible restaurant!
