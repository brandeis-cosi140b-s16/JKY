It was between Blue Adobe and TQLA in Gilbert but Blue Adobe appealed to me Bc it looked more down to earth. We were in for a surprise. It was not only very welcoming, our waitress was so kick ass! She was witty and nice. The food is bomb and we have never tasted flavors like this. At first we thought it was a typical Mexican restaurant but it's more New Mexico style. My man had the ancho rubbed ribs and it came w a wedge salad and cornbread, pecan cornbread, that is. It was so unique, we couldn't stop eating it! I got the Oscar Medallion meal w blue crab and jalape√±o on top a cut of meat and hollandaise noodle sauce thing. Again, never experienced the flavors like that in my life but my palate just got more and more used to it. There were three TV's at a quaint bar but they were super quiet. So glad we didn't go to TQLA to get some Chilli's like quality and type of food/service at ridiculous prices. We paid $20 per meal but we were given two days worth of food and the bill came to $50 total, which was crazy Bc we had drinks and appetizers. I seriously wish I could've left the waitress a $50 tip her service was that great. This establishment has been here for 14 years! They r obviously doing something right.
