Came in a referral from one of the tattoo parlors downtown. Needless to say, I wasn't disappointed. Staff was on it and didn't hesitate to get done whatever you asked for. Had the fish tacos and hands down they were the best I'd ever had. Instead of the typical slaw and tartar combo you see elsewhere, they infused sweet and spicy all while keeping the fish adamantly known amongst the flavors. Love the ambience, the setting, all of it.

Only critique - just a tad more attention to the drinks (or lack thereof). 

Thanks for having us, guys. We know the next time we're in Vegas we've got a spot we know we'll enjoy.
