Oh Fat Boy... Where do I start? Let me just say, I love you... Everything about you. Whenever I see you I get this warm and fuzzy feeling. I know you can give me what I want, and lots of it. I love your smell. I love your taste. When you give me chencho fries and I gobble them up... Mmmm... So good. The crust of your pizzas is simply amazing. I came to see you just the other day. I wanted something a little... Weird and I was nervous to ask for it, but when I did, you served it right up with a smile on your face. CHENCHO FINGERS!!! Are you kidding me?!? Oh Fat Boy. You are what's good on the east side...

Seriously, this place is awesome and the guy who runs it is always super cool. The food is... It's just... It's delicious, plentiful and cheap! I couldn't ask for anything more! 

The place is small, but it seems like a lot of their business is take it. Try it... You will fall in love!
