I'm coming back again! The food was great (done by Chef Ricky) service was excellent given by Laura and the margaritas were delicious. Laura took the time to explain the menu. Was extremely welcoming and knew what she was doing!! Chef Ricky we will be back to try your great food! It's a 30 min drive but well worth it!!! :)
