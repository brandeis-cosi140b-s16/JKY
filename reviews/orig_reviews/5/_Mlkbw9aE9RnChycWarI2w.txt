Hats off to the great staff at El Hefe!  There was a miscommunication on when myself and 100 more of my friends were supposed to show up. We showed up an hour early, they were a bit overwhelmed as they should be. However, they all kicked it up a notch, big time. The staff was friendly and the managers were making sure that everyone was taken care of. 

The Mahi Mahi Tacos were outstanding, I will be back.
