John Lee, who already owns what I consider to be the best sushi restaurant in Las Vegas (Soho) has come up with an amazing fast-food concept in Jaburrito, a Mexican-Japanese-California fusion product that is absolutely amazing!  We had the Rockport and Kodiak, one sushi style wrapped in seaweed and the other with cooked salmon and cream cheese. (See photos). The flavors were unique and delicious.  Also try the taro chips with cheese.  This place has become my new (and healthful) lunch choice.
