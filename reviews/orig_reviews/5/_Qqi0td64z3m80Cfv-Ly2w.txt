I had an amazing time here at coconuts! My family & I went in last night & tried the "mexican sampler" which had a little bit of all the appetizers! The food was incredible & the service was superb. I saw a few of the managers walking around asking how the service was. I am thoroughly impressed with my experience here & will definitely be back!!!!
