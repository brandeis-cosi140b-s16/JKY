I honestly don't know how anyone (who ate what I ate at least) could give this place anything BUT 5 stars.  I am giving it 5 stars even though I did not like the salty chips or salsa - that's how good the main course was .... I had the special "3 course meal" thing they had ... started off with some nacho things that were AMAZING ... SO GOOD - pork ones by far were my favorite - then onto the main course which was a steak and enchilada - the meat was so flavorful on this it was crazy, and it was ended with flan for dessert ... very tasty.  I can't wait to go back and try other things on the menu.  This is probably  my new favorite spot for Mexican food in the east valley from now on.  GO TRY IT
