I don't go to Papi Chulo's very often, but when I do I am pleasantly surprised.  It seems like other Yelpers have a bad time, but the food has always been flavorful, fresh and hot.

We had a Groupon for breakfast or lunch and decided to try breakfast on a Saturday morning.  There was one other table with a couple from the hotel, after they left we were the only customers there.  We both ordered Papi's Breakfast Skillet, one with egg whites and the other with chorizo.  I asked for chips and salsa and got warm chips with salsa, salsa roja (awesome & spicy) and green chili salsa.

The skillet had crispy, seasoned home style potatoes (Papi's potatoes), peppers & onions, jack cheese and egg. It comes with three flour tortillas.  Comparing their skillet to Village Inn & Perkins, Papi's is easily the best.  Hot and tasty and adding some of the salsa roja made it spicy and extra awesome.


Give this place a shot.
