We just moved out to Gilbert and have been trying to find some great places to eat but haven't had much luck. Until one day we stumbled upon Nando's. Let me tell you, this place is AWESOME!!!!! My husband says is going to try everything on the menu. Everything that we have had has been perfect. My three and four year olds love it too. Every time we pass Nando's they ask to eat there. Oh and the margaritas are soooooooooo GOOD!
