I went here for $1.25 taco Tuesday with a friend and I am so glad I did. I had 2 beef (steak) tacos with lettuce and cheese but they will make anyway you want. The meat was well seasoned and vary tasty. They have a big selection of hot sauces and the beer was cheap. Coors light for $2.50. Great place to go on a little budged. I will go again.
