I've lived less than a mile from this place for 3+ years and I'm just now finding out about it?  WTH?   Searching for good, quick Mexican food shouldn't be hard, but I'm so over Filiberto's, so took a quick glance at Yelp and stumbled upon this place. After looking at the photos of the food, it was a no-brainer. 

Chheng L.'s photo of the 1/2 carne 1/2 carnitas was what did it for me. Call me a copy cat, but I'm pretty sure I ordered exactly what was pictured and I'm SO glad I did. It was amazing!  

Let me just say that the burritos are HUGE. The couple in front of us ordered several, and they stuffed one so much, they had to re-wrap it because the tortilla wasn't big enough!   We ordered 2 burritos and 1 veggie tostada. Out the door for under $15. Nice.  

We will definitely be here again!
