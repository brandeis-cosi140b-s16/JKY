Tried this place out for the first time last night, will definitely be back. Tip, make reservations as the wait was 1 1/2, but plenty room to sit and have a drink in front of the fire. I had the rotisserie chicken (tasty and a lot of food) and the hubbs got the enchilada plate...the green chile chicken enchilada was d'lish.  Make sure to have a drink in the basement.
