Great service!  Our waitress was always near and stopped at all the right times. The $3 margaritas were also great and several. The nachos were tasty, I've had better. The same goes for the fish tacos.  Those two dishes more than slated our hunger and in fact some of each was still on our plate when we finished. We'll  be back.
