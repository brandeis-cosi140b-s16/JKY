It's funny.  We've been kicking off our weekends here for nearly 10 years now.  In all that time I had never tried the seafood enchiladas. Shrimp, scallops and octopus in your choice of ranchero or green sauce.  In a word...WOW.  This dish is a little more daring than the rest of their menu and well worth ordering!  Beats my usual bean tacos!
