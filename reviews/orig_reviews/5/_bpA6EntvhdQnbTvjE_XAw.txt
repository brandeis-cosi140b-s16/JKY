AMAZING FOOD AND SERVICE.
The food was amazing and they even have a vegetarian meanu.  The drinks were great, the margaritas were the perfect size and made with quality.
Had a great time, the waiter was so helpful, so responsive, and organized. We got our food on time so fast and it was the best mexican restaurant in Vegas.  Downtown Las Vegas is a great place to check out. With Zappos moving into the area, the nightlife has changed. I am a Los Angeles native and was in Vegas and staying at the Wynn/Encore  i got tired and wanted out and came to DTLV and found La Comida a few months back. So everytime I come to Vegas, I check out La Comida.
