Ate here 1.29.13

Best dinner the whole week we worked in Las Vegas! Had a booth at the Mandalay Bay convention center right around the corner from this place. 
  Seriously so good! :o Everything is fresh, fresh, fresh! Service is extremely attentive, friendly, and prompt. Chips and salsa are super tasty plus they give you a variety of 3 different types of salsa. 
  I ordered the chile renello, by far the BEST chili renello I've EVER HAD! Sorry mom :/ I also got their seasonal mojito with lemon and blueberries! Yamaaah! 
  My husband got the skirt steak, he said the "cut was premium, flavor was amazing, and was cooked to perfection!"
  He also loved his blood orange jalape√±o margarita, which he said," was a welcomed distraction from the average margarita!" ;) 
  We will be back for sure next yr!
