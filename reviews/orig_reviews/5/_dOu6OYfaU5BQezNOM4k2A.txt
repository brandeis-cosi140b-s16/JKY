Great food and service. They're clearly branding themselves as not being a fusion restaurant, but a restaurant that serves Mexican and Chinese dishes, of which the flavors compliment each other. It's not your typical sit down restaurant and that's fine with me. We had duck tongue tacos, carnitas tacos, fried rice, dan dan noodles, and some pork pot stickers. The pot stickers were very juicy inside and crispy outside, but the flavor was nothing special. Everything else was exceptional. Also ask for the hot sauce. It was a nice touch.
