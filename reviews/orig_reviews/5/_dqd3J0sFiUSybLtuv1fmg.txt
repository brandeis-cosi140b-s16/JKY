This place is great. 

They are doing a great job considering they haven't even had their grand opening yet!

Food is delicious, staff is helpful and nice and they all really want to know how to make everything better and are actively working on it. I did not find the menu confusing, you choose your tortilla, filling, cheese sauce and topping ... not hard. 

Keep it up! You're doing a great job and you can only get better from here :)
