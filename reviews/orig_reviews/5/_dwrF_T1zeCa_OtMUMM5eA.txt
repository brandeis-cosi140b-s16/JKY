I never thought I would like beans in a taco but Omg their tacos are tdf! I tried the carne asada and didn't think they could be better but the carnitas and el pastor are amazing! Tacos are huge and the green sauce on the table, so good! Agua Fresca is the best we've had in awhile!  Our go to spot anytime we go through Vegas! Wish there was one closer to home!
