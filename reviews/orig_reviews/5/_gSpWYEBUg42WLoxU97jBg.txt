We come to this happy hole in the wall just about every time we've gotta be on this side of town. Easy service, and food that has been consistently great or at worst very good every time we've been by. $3.50 Hawaiian, and $5 pastrami: just the right seared crust on the patty, and just the right softness in that bread.

A part of me would like to give 4 1/2 stars for unimpressive drink options, or the kinda sketchy local experience ― today we had a guy walk in and work some hustle trying to sell cheap perfume to diners ― but even with those little reservations, I just plain love this place and always look forward to coming back.
