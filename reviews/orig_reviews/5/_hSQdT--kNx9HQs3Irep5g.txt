Tried this place after reading the reviews and I wasn't disappointed.  No problem with the ordering system and the service was great.  I has the abodado and al astor tacos loaded.  Love that they give you a whole plate of grilled peppers and green onions.  Total bill $8.  I paid more for one beer at the Palazzo.  Nothing fancy but a real solid value.
