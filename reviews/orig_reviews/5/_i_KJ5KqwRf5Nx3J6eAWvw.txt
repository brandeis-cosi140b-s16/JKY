One of they few places that gives class A fries.

The place is located next to the wynn, and parking is never hard to find as they most of the customers that come walk in from the strip. The interior of the place is surprising clean. The place also offers inside and outside seating, more than likely you'll eat inside cause it's either boiling hot or goosebumps cold outside.

Ordering the food was confusing at first only because you're greeted by the register as you come in. But just go up to any of the workers, order, go back to the cashier, and feast on your food. The prep time for food is miniscule only time you would have to wait is if you order fries.

From your first bite you can tell the quality of the food is far beyond any regular ole taco place. The sauce & adobado just go so damn well together. But to me the main star of this place are their adobado fries. THAT THING IS SERIOUSLY PACKED. Guac overload!!!!! The fries crispy, the cheese cheesy, the sour cream & guac perfect amount, and the avocado on top? Equivalent to a cherry on a ice cream. 

Personally the price of the taco's a ripoff. But the price for the fries a steal.

PRO TIP! You can call ahead of time and order so you don't have to wait in the long lines!

If anything could change in this place, it'd be for them to add heaters in their outside seating, it's just too cold out to eat outside.
