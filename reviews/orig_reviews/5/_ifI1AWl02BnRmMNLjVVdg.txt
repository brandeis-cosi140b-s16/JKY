Today was Father's Day & my Mom's Birthday, so we decided to grab some lunch here.  Here's a tip.....if you want to come here on a holiday and you don't mind eating lunch early, stop by between 9:30-10:30 am.....it's open and there's no wait to get in.  If you come after 11 am, it will be jam packed.

I ordered the Nachos & Mom ordered the Playa Combo....which is a Chile Relleno & Chicken Taco.  The food came out quickly and of course everything was fresh and delicious.

I love how they have complimentary unlimited Chips & Salsa w/Beans.  The Salsa is spicy, just right and the Chips are homemade.

This place never disappoints!

Happy Father's Day to all the Dad's out there!

¿Voy a volver? ¡Por supuesto!  (Will I return?  Of course!)
