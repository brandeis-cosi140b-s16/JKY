I was enchanted just upon entering this place (see pics)

It only got better once I was inside even though it was a pretty small place , approx. 10 tables. 
It was dark for ambiance but brightly decorated, white linen tables, fresh flowers on each table, parrots mirrors etc.etc.

We started with the Guacamole and tostadas with a salsa trio 
(see pics) Pico De Gallo, Chipotle and the most Divine Fresh Tomatillo Salsa I have ever tasted, I was literally eating it with a spoon once the chips ran out!

Everything was so fresh and tasty! 
We also ordered a Watermelon Agua Fresca which was so refreshingly delicious, even though I'm not sure it was a good mix with Mexican food (we took it to go)

I ordered the Enfrijoladas: Homemade corn tortillas filled with chicken and topped with a black bean sauce (see pics)
WOW! This was so Perfect I can even begin to tell you how Much I LOVED it!

My guest ordered the Farolitos Al carbon with Chicken (see pics)
The taco came with rice speckled with fresh veggies like corn and chiles along with a bowl of soupy pintos.
Another Amazing dish even though the tacos were pretty spicy overall it was all very fresh and flavorful.

Unfortunately we did not have room for dessert , but that's just one more reason to come back.

Did I mention the waitstaff team.......Impeccable service! 
My glass never emptied, in fact It never even got half full.

I can't forget the man on guitar ,I mean  who doesn't love being serenaded during Lunch!

A Definite Must Try Folks! You Don't Know What Your Missin'!
