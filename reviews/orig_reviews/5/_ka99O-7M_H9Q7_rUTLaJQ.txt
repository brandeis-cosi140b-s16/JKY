YUMMY YUMMY YUMMY, I got love in my tummy!  This place rocks! I have to say, we almost skipped over this place, it just sort of gave me the eh, who cares vibe. Boy am I glad we tried it anyway! The prices are good and the food is awesome, plus these guys were open in the wee hours of the morning. SMART. I will be back!
