I can't believe we are just trying this place. Where do I begin? Happy hour, happy hour, HAPPY HOUR!! My hubby and I had heard that appetizers were half off between 3-7 so we decided it would be a good time to try it out. 

First of all, the house margarita ($4.50 on happy hour) was fantastic---not too sweet with a nice kick. They also had a ginger peach margarita on special that was very good too.

For appetizers we enjoyed the crab cakes, calamari, and the fresh guacamole. The crab cakes were out of this world. The sweet corn sauce was the perfect compliment to the crab. I would definitely order this again. We consider ourselves calamari snobs as its one of our favorite apps, and TQLA's gives other restaurants a run for their money. The batter was crisp and light and to our surprise they added fried jalape√±os and onions to the basket. It was a huge portion and the spicy sauce and garlicky aioli was a nice touch. Chips and salsa paired with the guacamole was enough to push us over the food coma edge. They serve two salsas, green and roasted tomato. We ordered an additional habanero salsa as well...EPIC! We asked our waitress what the base was because it was deliciously sweet with a nice heat. To our surprise the base is carrot with pineapple, apple and of course the habanero. I could've made a meal on the salsa and tasty guacamole alone.

All in all, I think we found a new place. The restaurant was beautiful, the service was friendly, and the food was excellent. We will be back again soon :)
