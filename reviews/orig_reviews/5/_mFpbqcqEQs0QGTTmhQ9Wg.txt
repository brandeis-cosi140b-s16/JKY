It doesn't get much better than this. This place has a small menu but great items you will keep coming back for. The green chili chimi...mmm so delish. You won't find good food like this many other places. This is one of those hole in the wall word of mouth places you will never forget.  

HUGE PLUS.. This location is now accepting cards and cash. 

This is a small family business so they have some funky hours, but it's worth the work to make it in. 

My family has been coming to the downtown location since I was little. They all taste the same. We are super happy that there is one closer to us.
