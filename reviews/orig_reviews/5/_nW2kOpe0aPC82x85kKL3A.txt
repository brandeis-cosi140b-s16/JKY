"Mexican food" is such a loose term in Madison. Some people think that Pedro's or Laredos are good places to find the elusive, delicious and authentic fare but they'd be wrong. If I can hear the staff speaking in mostly English then I know the food won't be what I'm looking for. If my tacos come with lettuce, tomato, and sour cream then I'm looking for the nearest salida.

Taqueria Guadalajara is hands-down the best place to find authentic and tasty Mexican food. 

They do it right: fast, friendly service, authentic meals and a very reasonable, if not underpriced, price point. This place is a home run and it's somewhat unassuming from the outside. I haven't had a single item from the menu that didn't make me want to keep eating. This place is the epitome of Mexico. Come here and eat some good food but don't be "that guy" and order flour tortillas. That's what Taco Bell is for.
