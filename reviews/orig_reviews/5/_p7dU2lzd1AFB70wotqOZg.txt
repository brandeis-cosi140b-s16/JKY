Awesome shrimp tacos!!  I am really picky and have very high expectations when it comes to fish/shrimp tacos and these totally passed the test.

STAFF: very attentive and nice without being suffocating.

ATMOSPHERE: quaint with a clean and nice beach feel.  The place is small, so you might have to sit outside under the misters.

FOOD DELIVERY TIME:  drinks immediately (including quick refills),  appetizer within 10 min. of ordering and entrees within another 15 min.

FOOD: very hot and crispy fish and chips for my kids.  Both kids loved the cod and wanted to go back. I even tried a bite and thought it was great.   Our shrimp tacos were filled with hot, very well cooked shrimp with crispy, cold cabbage and their own creamy dressing on top.  We thoroughly enjoyed the small sides if rice and whole pinto beans that came with the tacos. (Didn't taste "canned" to us, like others accused)

When I read some of the other nasty reviews, I was shocked and couldn't believe it was the same place I just ate at.  I did not have any complaints and am excited to go back soon!
