Fabulous food and amazing decor - and food is just as spectacular!! The guac is a must every time! I MUST recommend brunch... I split the cinnamon waffles (like desert) and the chicaquiles (sp?). I got the best of both worlds a south of the border breakfast with eggs and the waffles were like a dessert. This will be a regular brunch spot for me on the patio. Thank goodness they are off the noisy and busy Scottsdale road! 
See you soon at The Mission - I'm the cute one with the bloody mary on the patio.
