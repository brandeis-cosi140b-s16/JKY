Beautiful restaurant with fresh plants and excellent lighting. The restaurant is open and has authentic paintings, fixtures and furniture. Most importantly the food is phenomenal! I am a regular at the Manhattan Beach Panchos and the new Panchos in Las Vegas is beyond belief! Excellent food and service in an authentic, beautiful atmosphere! The bar offers top quality cocktails and wine and the bartenders are professional and experienced. Just what Vegas needed!
