OMG THE CREAMY RICE. I can't get over how delicious it truly is; some blend of white rice, sour cream, grilled onions and magical unicorn horns or something because it is awesome! I always get the Chicken Fajita Rice Bowl and it's great every time. The chicken is always tender and perfectly cooked, the vegetables are great...and now we all know how I feel about the rice.

I've heard their fish tacos are to-die-for as well, but I've never had the opportunity to try them because I'm so loyal to my beloved rice bowl. 

The ambiance is super cute too; this is just a great place for a quick bite to eat or for takeout. The counter people/runners are always very friendly and helpful...sometimes almost too helpful! We had one food runner who loitered near our table the whole meal and kept asking us if we needed anything, it got to be a bit much - but that's okay, I'd much prefer that to being neglected as customers so often are these days.

The Deluxe/Zen 32 folks have another winner!
