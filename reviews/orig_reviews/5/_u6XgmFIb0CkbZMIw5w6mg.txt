Anyone who gives this place anything less than 5 stars needs to reevaluate their priorities in life!  I've been eating at Casa Don Juan for years and the food has never changed and is always top notch!

We were promptly seated and asked if we want cheese dip of guac.  Of course we said yes to the guac!  Your crazy if you don't say yes!!  I love that the cost is "market price" like we are ordering a lobster or something.  It's not crazy expensive and so worth the $5.95 we paid.  The chips and salsa were brought out quickly along with our drink order.

My mom enjoyed her meal as did I.  I ordered the "super burrito" with chili verde.  It was the perfect amount of spicy.  It was gigantic and I was only able to eat less than half for I was full from the bomb chips and dips!  We had margaritas to add to the great meal!  

The service is always great!  They are friendly and give you the feeling that they are pleased you are there dining with them.  Even the guys who fill your water and refill your chips are friendly and efficient!

They have a small outdoor dining area which would be ideal on a First Friday!  Parking is ample both in front and out back.  

Don't listen to the negative ninnies on this place!  They don't know good Mexican food!  Can't wait for my hubs to bring me back here for our anniversary next week
