Best nachos I've ever had. They're fast and efficient. The service was great. Back to the nachos.... Cheesy, meaty, saucy, and perfect. The condiments came on the side which was unusual but much appreciated. Their enchiladas were super cheesy, the sauce was yummy and homemade. The hot sauce tasted just like Valentina hot sauce but the homemade version. Our server was sweet, a little rushed at first but we came in at the end of a lunch rush. It didn't affect how quickly everything got to is though. Highly recommend this place.
