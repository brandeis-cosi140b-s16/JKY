We had great modern twist mexican fair in a relaxed atmosphere. The portions were modest for American standards but not the normal style you get anywhere else. The place is on the -1 (street) level and it's great to people watch and enjoy the Caesar building. Our waitress, Jaclin (Jac) was great fun, very relaxed and wonderful; we liked her a lot. The large TV screens with sports are a bit distracting but hey it's America and it's the Vegas strip so the TVs aren't even that distracting. All in all a great find on the strip.
