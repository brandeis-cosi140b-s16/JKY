Had my Birthday Dinner at Los Dos tonight and it was great! Friday night about 6:30pm, greeted with big smiles and seated quickly. Host and servers were extremely attentive . Great Kickass Margs, chips with the classic Red n Green salsa's. It was a Pasole /Pazole night for me with "Christmas". Spouse had the Carne Adavodo Enchilada dinner and just because they are soooo good, aka carte Rellenos! We were talked into the Pumpkin Flan which was Yummy!! Great way to finish off an awesome dinner.  Yes! We like it here!
