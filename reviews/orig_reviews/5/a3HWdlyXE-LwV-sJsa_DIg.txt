Best al pastor street tacos in the U.S. I visit Mexico City 5 times a year and this is the only place that come close to a real street taco. The gourmet ones are good for gringos but not this gringo. Try the Jamaica and horchata waters. Don't forget about there happy hour deals. The service is mostly bad, they have one good server, but the food is worth it. Come with an open mind and don't come if your used to be pampered.
