What an absolute gem of a breakfast spot. No sign at all outside even indicating it exists. 

We saw that this place had great reviews on Yelp and wanted to give it a try. The inside is really cozy and charming. They cook the food on a wood - burning grill which you can see from your seats. I ordered the Carne Avodavo with eggs sunny - side up, hash browns and added some level 2 green sauce on the side for some kick. The portion was massive and I could barely eat half of it but it was delicious. 

I saw others at the restaurant drinking mimosas which looked incredible (all the juices are fresh-squeezed apparently)

The bar looks really cool and I'd love to try the dinner place next door, which is surrounded by wine racks and has a large wooden table in the middle great for groups. 

I will definitely be back here!
