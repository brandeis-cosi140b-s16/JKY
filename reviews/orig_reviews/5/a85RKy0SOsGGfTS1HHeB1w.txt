Went to Los Tacos on Sunday March 22.  I made sure to Yelp a mexican food place before we drove to Vegas, and was not at all dissappointed with Los Tacos.  The food we received looks exactly like it does in the photos that some have posted - which is what I was looking forward to.  I ordered the loaded chicken taco, my husband ordered the not loaded carne asada tacos and a chicken quesadilla with a side of rice/beans for the kids.  We were so hungry when we got there, but so not hungry and happy when we left.  Everything was very fresh and staff was friendly and yes, they are bi-lingual which we appreciated.  Yum.  :)
