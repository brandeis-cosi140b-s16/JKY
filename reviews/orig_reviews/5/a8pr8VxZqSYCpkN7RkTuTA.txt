I was in Phoenix for a conference and ended up at Joyride on a Tuesday afternoon. I was with a friend.   We had each had three of their $2 tacos. I had two chicken and one steak. They were incredible. Unlimited chips and salsa, banana pudding on Graham cracker crust with caramel sauce,  and $5 pitchers of Dos Equis completed our meal.   The best part of the experience was the service. Our water glasses never went below half and they brought me a new chilled glass each time I poured a beer. I will revisit Joyride any time I am here in the future. 

Btw, we took the train out from downtown and Ubered back. Easy trip and an enjoyable time. Highly recommend.
