So, I'm sitting around all day Jones-ing for their food again.  It's crazy how nice they are.  The order was short rib taco, the Standard burger with cheese, and a Standard burger with cheese wrapped in lettuce.  After I signed my credit card receipt and they were getting my order ready, he opens the window and asks I would like a gluten-free bun, obviously noting the one that was wrapped in lettuce was most likely due to a gluten allergy.  He was absolutely correct.  They wrapped it in lettuce, as originally requested, and sent a gluten-free bun also.  Both observant and kind.  Come to find out, 99% of their menu is gluten-free so people with allergies or Celiac's will be happy to know that.  Thanks again The Stand-Eva, Ron, and staff.  

Please go and support this place for my own selfishness of being able to keep going there myself!
