I've been to this place a couple times and it's been really good both times! Today my friends and I were served by Pete who was really cool and definitely a great server. Very personable, quick, and professional. The best part was that he had good knowledge of the menu and made great suggestions!

I had the Parmesan Pecan-Crusted chicken salad which was delicious! A little bit on the sweet side but all in all a great salad. It filled me up and then some and I'm 6' 200 lbs and eat a decent amount of food haha. 

One of my roommates had the chicken artichoke and mushrooms and catfish beignets which he enjoyed. His girlfriend had quesadillas which she liked. And my other roommate had the ribs with a side of fries which he devoured and loved. 

We also are 3-4 cornbreads which is one of the best parts about going here. I was too full from the salad to try a dessert but maybe next time. We will definitely be back here.
