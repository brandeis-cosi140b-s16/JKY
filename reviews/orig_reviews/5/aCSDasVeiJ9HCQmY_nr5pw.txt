We went here for a later lunch before our show in Mandalay Bay.  Everyone from the hostesses, to our waitress, Tiffany, and the other wait staff (chips and salsa guys, etc.) were very nice and attentive.
The free chips & salsas here are really good and addictive, it was hard to stop munching on them.  Until we got our meals, that is, which were also quite good.  For vegetarians, they have a tasty avocado taco dish that I really enjoyed- it was unique and fulfilling.
Our server, Tiffany, was really excellent and made our meal that much better.  She was fast at refilling our chips&salsa and sodas.  At the end, when I mentioned we had to get going for a show, she said she'd bring us our last refills to go- how nice!
