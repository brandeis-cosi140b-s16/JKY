OMG. Yep, I said it.

Food was outrageously delicious.
Ambiance was authentic, creative vibrant and lively.
They have a live mariachi band that sings current songs in English and traditional songs in Spanish. 
They have a lady in the dining room making the tortillas, beans and soup.

It's a little bit off the strip, so the wait time was non-existent. 

Oh, & if THAT wasn't enough... It has held the title of Best of Las Vegas for 6 years.

Just go.
