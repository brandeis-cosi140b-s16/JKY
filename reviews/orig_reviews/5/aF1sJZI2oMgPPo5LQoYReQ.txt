Great well made, quality Mexican Food!  We all had a great meal, great service by Mark and even got to tease Karen the hostess, when she scared my friend by walking by close to the table, too funny!  
But seriously come for the food, I had the Mole and the Flan, all delicious and prepared with care by Paco, who came out of the kitchen to meet us, great place!
