This was the very first place I dined in AZ when I moved here to attend Arizona State.  I've gone there about 125 times in the 15 years since.  

the place isn't much too look at, but there's enough to look at in Tempe to worry about that.  I'm there for one and only one reason - the finest grilled chicken in Phoenix (all competitors fall flat) coupled with some outstanding tri-tip.  I honestly feel like the tri-tip in the late 90's was better than it is now, but it is still very good.

Tired of the usual?  Try this place.  Very easy on the wallet, too.
