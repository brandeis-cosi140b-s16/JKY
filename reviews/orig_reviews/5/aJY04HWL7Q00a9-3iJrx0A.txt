The tortillas here are awesome, and every time I visit Carolina's, I walk out with a dozen.  The green machaca is excellent and quite possibly my favorite item on the menu after the tortillas.  I can't say I really didn't enjoy anything I tried here, except maybe the enchiladas, but I hate enchiladas, so it's not really fair.  The chicken chimichanga was very good when I had it, and I love getting a butter tortilla when I go in as well.

A few other things, seating can be quite the pain when the place packs up, and it really gets packed around noon.  However, I do think the atmosphere is definitely part of the experience, I have been to the other locations, and there was something lacking there.  The food wasn't quite the same and it didn't feel quite as authentic.  This is the location I will consistently return to.
