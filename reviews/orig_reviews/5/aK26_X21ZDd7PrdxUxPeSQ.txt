HOLY FUDGE!

Best TACO EVER. I am a native Texan and I haven't ever had a taco as good as El Gordo. Honestly I wasn't even drunk when I ate here. I came here around the dinner hour and it was busy but not slammed. I ordered the adobada based on the Yelp recommendations. SO SO SO SO GOOD! The meat is roasted on a spit and carved off with a huge knife. It is served on two small corn tortillas, topped with onions, cilantro and an avocado cream sauce. I also ordered the asada which was good too, but not amazing like the pork. 

So yeah, I came here twice in one day. Both times got tacos and the 2nd time got tacos and  tostada. NOT EVEN SORRY. At $2 a pop El Gordo won't break the bank and will fill you up and leave you wanting more. Just remember they are smallish so don't feel bad if you have 6. lol. 

Come here sober the 1st time and most definitely come back if you are drunk.
