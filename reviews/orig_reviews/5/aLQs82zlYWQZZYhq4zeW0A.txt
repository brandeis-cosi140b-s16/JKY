Celebrated my birthday here last night. Food was amazing. I stuck to my old standby of cheese enchiladas, which were great. The red sauce had a unique taste, it tasted like it had pot roast drippings - it was the best red sauce I've ever had. For appetizers we had the cheese crisp and guacamole. The guacamole was very good with chunks of avacado and a light hand used with the seasoning. The place is huge and the staff are very friendly. This is now my go to Mexican food restaurant.
