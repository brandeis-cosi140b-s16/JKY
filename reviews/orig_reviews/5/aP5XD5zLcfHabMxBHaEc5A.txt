If you're in Vegas and craving Mexican food this is the spot. The bartender is very knowledgeable and can whip up an excellent drink. As far as the food is concerned it's absolutely the best Mexican food I have had so far. The dining room service is top notch and the staff is very knowledgable about the menu. The front receptionist was cranky and I thought for a minute she might own the place but I was wrong. She was very rude but everyone has a bad day. I can't take it away from the rest of the staff who are very humble. (MGR) if your reading this, hiring a pretty face is great but do some one on one training so they know how much their snobby attitudes towards customers can hurt the overall greatness of your establishment. I recommend this place to put on your bucket list of must eat places. Keep up the excellent cooking. Cheers!
