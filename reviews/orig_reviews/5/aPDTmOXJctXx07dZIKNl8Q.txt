Very tasty, high quality food made with top shelf ingredients...perfectly seasoned, awesomeness.

I'm a picky eater, I have high demands for everything, and I usually need to self-season and tweak most dishes, but not here...everything from the tortillas to the beans and garnish were delicious and perfectly flavored, no need for even salt or pepper. 

Order anything you want, heck even order with your eyes closed, and it will be good. Nice staff, cool ambience, not too loud or obnoxious, and you will probably see a celebrity or two walking around.

If you want something different while visiting the area, try this place...much better than the typical boring steak and potatoes you see all over vegas. Thumbs way up!
