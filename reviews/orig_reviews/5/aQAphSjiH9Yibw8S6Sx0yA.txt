My husband and I have been twice now with friends and have loved the food.
The 5 stars are basically a rating for food and ambiance alone, which is well worth the higher price point.

Service both times was mediocre, both times, different waiters forgot items and took a very long time to get us our drinks. The servers all seem to be predominately male and all around the same age group and ethnicity which kind of seems odd for Vegas but they really could use some brush up skills in terms of service.
