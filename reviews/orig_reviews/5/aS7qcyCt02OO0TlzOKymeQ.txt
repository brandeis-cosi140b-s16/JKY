This place is amazing! My fiance had the country fried burger and I had the burger burlee, they were both the most incredible burgers ever! The sweet potato tater tots with the house made spicy ranch is delicious. I will be coming back here often since the price is so affordable for how yummy it is! It's just the right amount of food. The one guy I met behind the counter was very nice and courteous as well!! :) can't wait to try something new next time.
