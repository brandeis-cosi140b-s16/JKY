If you look at my reviews, you will see I'm kinda stingy with my 5 stars but, this neighborhood spot deserves it.
Our server, Amy told us to take any seat on the patio. As soon as we did, the sprinklers went on soaking the table (no food yet) but, enough for Amy to offer a free round of drinks. 

The food was wonderful. We got short ribs, shrimp tamale, and a quesadilla dish. All were excellent. 

Comfortable place, good service, great food, reasonable prices. Can't beat that combo
