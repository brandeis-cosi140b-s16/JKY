I was craving legit tacos al pastor from the Mexican Riviera and Taco y Taco definitely came through for us! The tacos al pastor were delicious. We also had the Mexican street corn, a novelty - but equally as good! The salsa bar had tons of variety including two tours of ridiculously yummy beans, at least half a dozen salsas, roasted peppers, pickled & fresh veggies. Top it all off with a fully stocked bar and I am sold. We will be coming back for all of our authentic Mexican food fixes. At their low prices, that will be often!
