I make the visit to this location every time I work in Centennial Hills.
This is my favorite location, just seems so much cleaner than the one on Rainbow!

Love the drive-thru and also their Hawaiian "Chipotle" concept!
1) You pick from bowls, tacos, salads or burritos. 
2) Your choice of meat : Kalua Pig, Huli Huli Chicken, Pulehu Steak, Grilled Fish or Veggies. 
3) Your choice of Brown Rice, Seaweed Rice, Veggies or Beans. 
4) Your choice of Mango & Roasted Corn, Pineapple Verde, Tomato and Onions or Guacamole
5) Extras to choose from Lettuce, Cheese, Lime, Cilantro, Bean Sprouts or Sour Cream.
They have chips, sauce/vinaigrettes, and also their infamous Coconut Bark.

The two visits here, I've ordered the bowl with Kalua Pig, Brown Rice, Mango and Roasted Corn with lettuce and cheese! I find it so easy to eat right before going to work!

Hawaiian food done semi-healthy! 
The drive thru is so quick and the employees were very helpful and patient when I was clueless on how to order, also very nice!

I'll be here every 3 weeks, because that's when it's my turn to head to Centennial.
Must try if you're in the area!
