I have not Yelped in a while because quite frankly it has been a long time since I have been impressed enough to care... I AM IMPRESSED! And that is saying something because I am from Hawaii and my father has been a chef on the Big Island for 40 years. In short, I love this place. The only downside is that they do not have "Mac-Salad..." Kind of strange for a Hawaiian joint... However, the meats were excellent and I will bring my dads Mac-salad the next time I visit :)
