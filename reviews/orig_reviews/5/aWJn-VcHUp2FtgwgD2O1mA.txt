We were warmly welcomed by our very friendly server Jose which set the tone for the whole visit.  The food was very nicely prepared and the decor was very warm and inviting.  I've been to El Sombrero BEFORE the current iteration and this is a really welcome improvement to the oldest Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas.  I will definitely be back.
