Came here for some awesome menudo. First time ever! The service was amazing. Hand made tortillas. The Agua de Limon bombness in its self. Great for hangover food. Customer service on point. Went around 12pm and it starts getting packed. Come early for the afternoon type a feeling. Atmosphere was like you were in that setting of amazing culture!!
