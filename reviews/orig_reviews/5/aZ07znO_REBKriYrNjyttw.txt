Long before Cabo Fish Taco was featured on the Food Network, one of my friends raved about it, and still does.  I don't live all too close to NoDa, so I don't make it to the hood to often.  When I do, the line is usually backed up out of the door.  Recently, I won a free dinner for Cabo in a raffle at a Charlotte Checkers game.  Today, we hit up NoDa since I also had free tickets to the UNCC basketball game and it was on the way there for us.  

We went about 5 o'clock, so there weren't too many people when we first got there.  The young man who sat us seemed stoned, drunk, hungover, grumpy, or all of the above.  That was the only negative of our experience.  My wife had some tuna tacos which were delicious and I had some steak tacos which were also delicious.  Our waitresses were very nice, friendly and helpful.  Cabo is probably a better place to go for lunch based on the portions and price, but it was fine for dinner for us.  Very fresh, very tasty, and overall just a cool place with a good vibe.
