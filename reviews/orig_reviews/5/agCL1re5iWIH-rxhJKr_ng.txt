Crescent is definitely one of my favorite venues for shows but their lounge is great as well. They have small but comparable drink menu, I love the Four Peaks Peach Ale. As for appetizers I also go with their chips and salsa, a favorite snack of mine. It comes with fresh thick and crispy tortilla chips and two types of salsa. One is a salsa verde that is very fresh and delicious and the second is a red salsa that is spicy,  garlicky, and delicious! In the past I ordered their chicken tacos for dinner which were very good, last time I ordered their Sinaloa Seafood Chowder and I was wonderful! It came with perfectly cooked chunks of fish, shrimp, tomatoes and other yummy vegetables. My boyfriend always orders their bean and cheese burrito which he always loves. If you're going for a show definitely come early to catch a yummy bite to eat!
