I'm a huge foodie. I love trying out new places and when I read about a restaurant that serves Mexican/Asian cuisine, I was pretty excited to check it out. First of all, the restaurant itself is amazing! It's beautifully decorated. You can tell that there was a lot of detail and creativity put into the design. Our server, Nicole, was incredible! She was sweet and very funny. She definitely made my first time here very welcoming. Her knowledge on the menu was great, and she was able to recommend the green chili pomegranate chicken enchiladas. They were AMAZING. I will definitely be checking this place out again and recommend it to family and friends.
