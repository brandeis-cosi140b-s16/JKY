I've lived here for 6 years and FINALLY made it to the Rokerij.  I have to say I was intimidated because I had no idea how to pronounce it.  How would I tell people about it without looking the fool?  Well, it's pronounced Rowkurree (long O, long E and silent J at the end).  Now there's no excuse for you not to try it.

Definitely go downstairs and hang out in the basement.  Very loungy and killer peeps to chat with.  Food is just amazing.
