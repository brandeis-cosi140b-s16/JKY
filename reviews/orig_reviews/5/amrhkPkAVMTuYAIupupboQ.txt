(Lyrics - Billy Ocean - Caribbean Queen)

She served me drinks during Happy Hour
And all heads turned cause it was Patron
In one bite of her dish I knew the rating and the name yeah
Ah they said I was the Yelper they wanted to tame

Barrio Queen
Now we're sharing the same drink
And Bo Bites I'll rate them number one
No more hunger on the run


Barrio Queen is located in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale.  I've heard many great things about their food and I was even here for the Yelp Elite event gathering.  Though I only reviewed the event itself; I had to come back to do my own review.

Needless to say, I was not disappointed. I came here after an art and wine gathering with some friends.  The wait for our seating wasn't too long and overall the place was popping!  On one side a full bar and the other another bar with dining area and patio.  The place we decorated with a Dia de Morte theme and old Mexican style setting.  

I shot for the House Margarita to start as my mates order some appetizers -- Barrio Guacamole; which is made right at your table.  Fresh avocado and pomegranite to your thick and chunky style guacamole is definitely a treat and delight in my book!  I would recommend everyone to start with it!   I was debating on a street taco since I had it during the Yelp Elite party and found it pretty darn tasty and street indeed.  However, I shot for the Torta with their signature dish Cochinita Pibil; their award winning banana leaf wrapped and slow cooked pork with sour orange, pickled onions, and pico de gallo.  This torta had some pop!  Warning! The green chili atop is extremely butt kicking hot.  Taste at your own risk!  Overall I think you can put the pulled pork in a torta or a tortilla cause it would have worked.  It was that just darn good and delicious!  

In the end, Barrio Queen was a hit and I would definitely welcome and recommend this gem anytime to anybody. - Enjoy!
