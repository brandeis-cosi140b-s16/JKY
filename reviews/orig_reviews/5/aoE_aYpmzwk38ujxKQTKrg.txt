First time at this restaurant and I couldn''t believe how big this place is... The parking lot was packed and cars were parking on the street.... I thought it was going to be a long wait but to my surprise we were seated right away. The frozen margarita was perfect like my favorite restaurant in Cozumel except I wasn't looking at the sea but the beautiful Las Vegas strip. The guacamole was made tableside and the waiter Angel made it 1/2 spicy to please our friends and 1/2 not for us. It was delicious. Our meals were also good. A lot of food so next time I will order a smaller portion. It has a party atmosphere and is not the place for a quiet dinner. This may just be our new Mexican restaurant!
