My cousin comes into town from Chicago like once a year and the first place he wants to go is Yo Rita. Besides the great drink and happy hour options the food is to die for. My cousin walks in and orders 4 Taco's and they are some big taco's. My most recent favorites are the Chorizo and Lamb. Get over to Yo Rita and eat some quality food.
