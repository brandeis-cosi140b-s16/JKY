I am really impressed by this small place with great flavor. Cool vibe and genuinely friendly folks working.  I got 3 tacos chicken, red beef and fried fish to-go - it gets a bit toasty in Phoenix this time of year. Food was  flavorful, fresh and delicious. It was my first real 5 star to-go experience. Highly recommended.
