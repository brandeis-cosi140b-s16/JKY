I was taken to Cantina Laredo for a birthday lunch and was lucky enough to take advantage of a tremendous Restaurant Week special!  The food was very fresh and very flavorful and had complex flavor profile!  The margaritas were great as is the patio and cool modern decor!  I loved it overall and will be back very soon!
