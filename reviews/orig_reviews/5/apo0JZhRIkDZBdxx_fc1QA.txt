Let me tell you something, disregard every other review here. This place is great, I have been here over 10x throughout my 3 trips to Vegas. This place has cheap authentic mexican food and I emphasize CHEAP & AUTHENTIC. Cheap as in breakfast starting at 4 bucks. They also have omelettes and huevos rancheros for 8$ with large portions that will FILL YOU UP. Great value, great taste, the other people here are insane. Definitely go here for breakfast/brunch.
