So good. Amazing. 5 stars. I got the tecolote plate, which is on the Spanish not English menu, and shrimp empanadas. The waitress was great in recommending a dish. I love Mariscos and I will definitely be back here. Salsa was fresh and spicy. It's hidden in the corner of a shopping certain. 100 percent recommend.
