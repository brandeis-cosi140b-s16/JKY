Do you hear that? That's the sound of every broke college student squealing in ecstasy over TACOS FOR $2.50. Come hungry, because these are filling. You can order as many tacos as you want (though three makes for a heavy meal), with as many toppings at you want. Let me repeat, FOR $2.50. I want to emphasize that the appeal does not lie only in the price. I'm unashamed to say Las Palmas has made up a considerable part of my diet for the past year, and I've consistently been impressed by the freshness and quality of the ingredients. 

I suggest mixing it up - try a different meat for each taco base (there's usually a selection of 5-6), and challenge your taste buds with their range of salsas and fresh toppings. Brace yourself, they mean business with the spicy salsas. 

Warning - It's a stand, not a restaurant, and offers no seating, so you'll have to take your tacos on the go. But despite being covered by only a small awning, Las Palmas is opened year round. (Yes, even when Pittsburgh becomes an arctic wasteland.) 

Overall: believe the hype. This place is the stuff of dreams.
