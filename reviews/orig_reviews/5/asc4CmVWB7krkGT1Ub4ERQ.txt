So my boyfriend and I ventured here for some prime time World Cup viewing as well as  some delicious noms (or food, if you will).

First thing's first. This place has the coolest atmosphere  ever (As far as restaurants go). Complete with laid back tunage and retro decor, I was instantly enamored. The smell that emerges from the kitchen is also to die for. Did I mention that they have a weekend happy hour that includes alcoholic agua frescas as well as local pitchers of beer? My goodness... could it get any better...

The food options are plentiful and everything is extremely fresh. I can't even begin to describe to you the wonderful appeal to the senses that each bite provides. My boyfriend ordered a make your own type of burrito and I ordered the chicken.  (Which sounds plain and boring but is anything but!) Inside the chicken burrito was butternut and chayote squash, spinach, mushroom, avocado, corn, queso, tomatillo salsa, pico gringo and aji amarillo. (i'm salivating just remembering it!) I also washed it down with an ice cold glass of some Four Peaks.... 

Overall, if you aren't in the area, this place is worth the drive. Devine food, amazing customer service, and extreme satisfaction all around. I will DEFINITELY be coming back.
