I've never been to a Mexican Restaurant like this one! First, the view is great. You have a great, high view of the strip, I'd suggest come here to eat at night. There are large windows on the wall that's facing the strip so that you can enjoy it while eating inside. Second, the food is amazing! We had a spicy shrimp dish, fresh guacamole, and tongue tacos. Everything tasted delicious. You can feel and taste the quality of the food. Third, the ambient is very nice. The decor is very tastefully arranged with Mexican culture and the waiters where very nice. 
You pay for what you get. It's not pricey, but it's not cheap either. I believe the shrimp dish was around 17-18$.
