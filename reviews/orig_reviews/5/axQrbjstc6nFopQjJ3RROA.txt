This is authentic mexican food and if you have ever been to Mexico, then this place will make you feel like you are back down there.  Everything is put together in front of you, there are 5 different lines depending on what you are looking for.  There is little they do not have in the selection of meats.

Last night we had the Mole Fries, AMAZING and if you know how real Mexican corn on the cob is supposed to be served, you can get it here.  In the many years I have lived here, I have not had real Mexican food.  

Yes there are many places here that claim to be mexican, but when you talk about authentic, this place is as authentic as you will find and the food is excellent.

Oh yes, they have a full bar as well, so like 6 tacos, corn on the cob, Mole Fries, a fountain drink and a freshly made margarita, $30 dollars and a very full bellies.  You will not go wrong here, this place is awesome....
