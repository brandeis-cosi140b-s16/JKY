This is the best Mexican food ever. Holy moly. Like, not even a competition after I ate here. The food is unbelievable, authentic, and delicious. The location is a bit sketch, but don't let that deter you! Nice and modern on the inside, and can we talk horchata? We should talk horchata. fresh strawberries IN THE HORCHATA. It was like experiencing your first orgasm. You guys are amazing, keep it up, I will for sure be back many many times.
