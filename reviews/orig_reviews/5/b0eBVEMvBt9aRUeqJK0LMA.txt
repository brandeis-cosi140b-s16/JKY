Loveeee this place! I've had almost everything on their menu and it is all WONDERFUL! You definitely have to try the bacon wrapped dates, rollo chingon, pomegranate guacamole and mushroom tacos.

Love the ambiance! Servers are great and know their stuff. Drinks are really good too. 

Best Mexican Asian fusion I've ever had! Great place for HH.
