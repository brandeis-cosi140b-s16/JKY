Cute little place! Outside looks a little sketchy but as soon as you go inside that all changes. Amazing service. The servers are so sweet and wonderful. Always complementing people and making them feel comfortable. 

Now the food. What a burger. It was so good!! The butter grilled onions are delicious and their guacamole is outstanding!
