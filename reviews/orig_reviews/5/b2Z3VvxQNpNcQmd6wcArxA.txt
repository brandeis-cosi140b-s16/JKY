In Vegas, where you have SUPER expensive, divine dining options (Joel R.) and VERY mediocre somewhat expensive dining options (say, Rain Forrest Cafe)... Border Grill is a VERY refreshing alternative. People complain about the prices, but considering all the other restaurants in that wing are $59 pre-fixe... it's all relative. 

Tucked a bit farther away towards the convention center, it was MUCH less crowded than other dining options in the area. Our service was excellent, and the food just as good as their location in Santa Monica, CA. 

The Sweet Corn Tamales and Ceviche were excellent. If I ever find myself back in Vegas, I will definitely go back here.
