The place is the happening place for try best tacos in town!  The al pastor tacos are the best!  They have beef heads, beef to tongues if you are into that.  
This place is very busy so expect to wait for a good 10 minutes due to the long line.  Be aware not all lines are for three food you want, so q up based on the tacos you want.  There are three lines.
