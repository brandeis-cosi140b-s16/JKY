Where to begin?! 

El Dorado and Ariana made my wedding day super special for my husband and I. We were looking to do a small reception for 50 guests and it was absolute perfection. They worked with us via phone, email, txt, and always catered to our every need with a smile on their face. The space is just perfect, roomy yet cozy, contemporary, casual yet fancy. Whatever you need, they can make it happen for you. They printed personalized menus for us, had a cocktail hour set up for us, and were open to changes up to 2 hrs prior to our event. 

THE FOOD- OMGOSH the food!!! Every single guest of ours, from grandparents to two year olds loved every bit of food, so tasty, so fresh, and the presentation is phenomenal. This is some of the best food I've had even in comparison to some nice places in LA. 

DRINKS- the drinks are just as fresh as the food and are all so tasty. Margaritas/mojitos made with real fresh lime and pi√±a coladas with fresh blended pineapple. I just can't wait to go back. 

El Dorado is a must go to restaurant in las vegas, hidden right behind the mall near the wynn and behind circus circus. So near the strip and far enough to avoid the large crowds trying catch a table. Probably a 5 minute drive away and Such a quiet relaxing place to enjoy great cuisine and drinks.

My husband and I cannot thank you guys enough for all that you did for us, and we will be sure to make a visit at least once every trip we make out to vegas.
