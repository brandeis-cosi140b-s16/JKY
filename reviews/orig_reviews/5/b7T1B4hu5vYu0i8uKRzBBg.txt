Best lunch specials during the week. Great service. You will get chips and salsa before your meal and the plate is a decent portion. I highly recommend having lunch here if you have only a few dollars.  I like this place because the atmosphere takes you out of your work zone.  I did see that they have huge margaritas.  They look good.  Didnt try one because I was on my work lunch hour.
