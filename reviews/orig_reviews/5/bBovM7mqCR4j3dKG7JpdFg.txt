LOVE MIXTECA!!! 

We live very close to here and eat here regularly!!  The food is authentic and great!!  Both breakfast and lunch are well worth the wait.  The staff is friendly and the owner is very involved in the restaurant!  

Only downfall is that the drive through is incredibly slow...much faster to go in.  :)
