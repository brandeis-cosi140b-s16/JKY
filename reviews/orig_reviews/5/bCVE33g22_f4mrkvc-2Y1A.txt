Oh my delicious! My husband and I had an amazing lunch at Distrito and I cannot wait to go back. We came in at 11:30 on Friday with a reservation and there were just a few other people in the restaurant. We had attentive and prompt service, quickly getting seated, drinks, and food. We were in, stuffed, and out in 50 minutes. The lunch special is out of this world and I hope it never goes away. For $15 you get a full sized app and entree of Distrito's amazing food. As a vegetarian, this was one of the best Mexican meals I've ever had. The flavors were so fresh, interesting, and satisfying. I had:

- Guacamole: Of course this is hard to mess up and Distrito's is spot on creamy, fresh, and bright. 
- Nachos: This could be a meal in itself. I found the red sauce to be a little too spicy for me, but it mellowed out when mixed in with the plentiful cheese and some guacamole from the other appetizer. Solid dish.
- Chili Relleno: Highlight of my meal! The red sofrito sauce was out of this world - so many complex & layered flavors, and such a complement to the pepper and quinoa. It's hard to describe but it's a warm, smoky, savory, spicy sauce. The quinoa was barely noticeable in a good way - very soft and almost buttery. Quinoa at home never tastes that good! I LOVED the black beans that came with the dish too - very flavorful (cumin I think) and good. The crumbling of mexican cheese over the dish gave it the perfect salty touch. This is an amazing entree for a vegetarian.
