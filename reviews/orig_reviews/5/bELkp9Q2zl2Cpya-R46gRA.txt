A hole in the wall but amazing quesadilla!!! The tacos were alright, the star of this restaurant would definitely have to be the quesadilla, you can't go here and not order one or two or THREE!! Lol the bread/crust/dough if the quesadilla is amazing! The salsa bar for the nachos they provide while you wait for your food is fun and there are some good selections, esp the cilantro one and I don't even like cilantro.
