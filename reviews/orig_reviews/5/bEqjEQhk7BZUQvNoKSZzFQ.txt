Are you kidding me? (Insert an array of scrumptious like eating noises). Build your own mini enchiladas with fresh and tasty ingredients. 

Several times I'll go for a family platter and just say, "surprise me" and see what they come up with. It's always tasty and their always very generous with all the free toppings and dressings. 

We come here a few times a month. Never dissapointed. I recommend getting whatever meat choice you like and adding a bit of the spinach mushroom to it. The cornbread stuffing is a nice dessert.
