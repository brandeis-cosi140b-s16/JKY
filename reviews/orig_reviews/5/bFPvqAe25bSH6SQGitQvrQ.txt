Our favorite hangout, we even used them to cater parties.  The hot salsa is simply the best.  Sonoran Enchiladas are my personal favorite though I haven't had a meal my wife and I did not like.  Patio/Bar atmosphere reminds us why it's great to be in AZ and  when it's too hot we can head indoors or do take out.  Hidden gem!
