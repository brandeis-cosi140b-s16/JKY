Taco Guild is brand new, which could explain why some of the reviews here talk about slow service. I didn't experience this problem, but it would make sense for those who visited during the first week. They were probably still leaning the ropes! For me, the service was great. The staff was friendly and efficient, and I would definitely recommend their food and drinks. 

Anyway, I had a sampler platter of three different tacos, and all of them were equally delicious. Easily some of the best tacos I've ever eaten, and you HAVE to try the spicy cheese dip. SO GOOD.

I was really impressed by the bartender, Kristin, who I bet knew more about different tequilas than even Wikipedia! Seriously, the amount of tequila in this place is insane. I don't remember the names of the drinks she made me, but both me and my friend loved them. In fact, I bought several gift cards from that bartender to give out for Christmas presents. Not to mention some for my own use, because I will definitely be back in the near future.

The experience was ultimately unique, and the ambiance inside of this place is amazing. If you like good food, or if you're looking for a rare ambiance with some amazing drinks, definitely try this place out.
