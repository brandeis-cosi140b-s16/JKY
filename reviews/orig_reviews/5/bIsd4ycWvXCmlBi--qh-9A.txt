Favorite Mexican food in town. Can get very busy, but they have great specials. The fundidos are awesome. Great hot chips and the salsa is clearly fresh and made daily. I love the giant shrimp they have for fajitas, salads or the fundidos. Taken many people there, no one has ever disliked it. Prices are very reasonable. Wednesday nights kids eat for a buck!
