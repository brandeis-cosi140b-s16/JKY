I went here for the first time yesterday with a friend.   We had a great experience - first of all, our waiter was one of the best I have ever had in my life!!  He was there when we needed him and so pleasant and knowledgeable.
The salsas, bean dip and chips are the best in Phoenix (and believe me I have sampled more than a few)
I had the Tostada Compuesta which was superb, really nice greens and very crispy corn tortilla - fresh - served w guacamole.  My friend had the carnitas salad and she was most pleased.
Finally I have found a Mexican restaurant that has a nice atmosphere with top food and some native dishes - not just the formula chain stuff that is everywhere.  The menu is extensive so you have a lot of choice.   I can't wait to go back.
I LOVED this place!
