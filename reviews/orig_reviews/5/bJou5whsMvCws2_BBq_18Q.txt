This hole-in-the-wall location is perfectly lovely. Believe the hype, people. My Texan friend complained that their tacos weren't spicy enough, but I'm sure you can let them know to up the spice level for you. I love that they make their own corn tortillas (which are gluten-free, friends). They also fry or grill any meat of your choosing. I met the owner once to interview him for Best of CU for Buzz, and he was the sweetest guy from Mexico City. He recommends the authentic fish tacos. I love their pumpkin flower and corn fungus quesadillas and their chicken volcanes, but all their menu items are perfectly delicious. All orders come with a side of chips with two types of lip-smacking salsa.

Rather long wait sometimes, but just go at odd hours or endure the wait. They have an array of authentic Mexican sodas waiting inside as well. Seating is rather fickle and sparse, so get ready to carry out unless you're eating plus one. Enjoy!
