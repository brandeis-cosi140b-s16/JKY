Barrio has issues, but the fare is unusually satisfying. Masterful even. Sure, it's busy and loud, a little too expensive, they dont take rezzies and the parking's cramped, but this is the kind of inventive, non-formulaic food  that makes dining out memorable, even joyful, and the other stuff worth enduring.  

Tacos look small and naked on the plate, unflanked by rice or beans, but are delicate, yielding and delicious - overstuffed with marvelous fresh ingredients; not the "fresh" touted by Taco Bell, but dreamy cheese, flaky halibut, exquisite slow roasted pork, fresh avocado wedge, secret sauce,etc.  Messy, surprisingly filling and an absolutely first class oral shindig, completely divorced from "tacos" elsewhere, and well worth the 12 or 15 dollars or whatever it is they charge. I like the fish tacos at Cheesecake Factory (which are bigger), but Barrio's are gastronomically in a different league. 

Soups are flavorful and textured.  My companions rave about the mole and the duck.  The pork torta is amazing.  To call the warm churros with ice cream a "treat" is a criminal understatement.  If you're on a budget, take your date just for the churros. Later, you will have sex.  It may not trump dessert, but you will have sex.  ( If for some reason, you dont, leave that person at once. You will never please them. ) 

Not everything on the menu elicits quite that euphoria, but there are half a dozen items that flip my feral bioswitch from "eat" to "devour", like a wolf over fresh kill.   It's like a click in my head, and this Silvana Salcido Esparza Comida de los Dioses, or whoever she is, deftly holds the switch.  

I'll forego comment on the bar because, surprisingly, I dont drink.
