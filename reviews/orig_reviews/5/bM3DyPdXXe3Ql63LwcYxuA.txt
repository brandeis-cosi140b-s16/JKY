Definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte. Their guacamole made table side is always a staple along with a fresh margarita to wash it down. They always seem to have at least one nightly special to overwhelm your taste buds. Tonight I had the flash fried tuna tacos with avocado and tomatillo sauce which were amazing. Highly recommend the tacos Marco polo or the barbacoa as well. I always leave with a full belly but never seem to have room for dessert.
