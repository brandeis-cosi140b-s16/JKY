Often crowded, and for good reason - fresh ingredients and hearty portions at great prices. The servers are all friendly, helpful, and easy to get along with.

Their menu isn't as expansive as other Mexican restaurants, but their quality beats quantity. Fajitas come out sizzling, the meat is tender and juicy, and vegetables are cooked to just the right level of crispiness. Great place to relax and hang out.
