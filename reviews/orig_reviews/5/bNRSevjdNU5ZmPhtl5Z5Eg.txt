Yessss.  THIS is what I'm talking about.  

Sometimes, I just want to feel like I discovered some little-known local gem, unpretentious and amazing.  That's what Dicks Hideaway is to me.  

Food, Great.  
Service, Great.  
Ambiance, makes me proud to live in the desert.  

Hard to find spots like this in our ocean of stucco sprawl, and when you do, ya just gotta cherish the moment.
