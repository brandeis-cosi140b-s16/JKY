We ate an early dinner at Popo's after a Spring Training baseball game at Maryvale Park.   We arrived at about 4:00 p.m., which was a good thing because the parking lot was almost full and there was only a short wait to be seated.   

It was a Saturday, and thus Popo's served .99 cent margaritas with dinner.   Each of us had a specialty salad, complete with sliced meat (chicken or beef) and sliced avocados.   The salads were fresh and plentiful.   They were delicious.   Our server was prompt and attentive and we finished our dinners by 5:30 p.m.

To top it all, our meal came to only $23.00 plus the tip - an almost unheard of price for dinner these days.

The fine quality of Popo's food and their prices showed in the many people who were already eating at Popo's when we arrived.   We don't hesitate to recommend Popo's to anyone who wants fine Mexican food at affordable prices.

Popo's is located in a reasonably safe neighborhood on West Indian School Road.   We will eat there again when we next visit Phoenix.
