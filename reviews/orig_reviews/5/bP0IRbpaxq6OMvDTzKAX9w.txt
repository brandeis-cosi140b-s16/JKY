This place cannot be beat on their green chile stew.  It's AMAZING.  I eat here about 2-3 times a year (not often enough!) with friends and it is always fantastic.  

I don't eat a lot of meat and they will turn any menu item into a vegetarian item for you - happily.  I never feel awkward ordering here.  The meat I *have* had at Richardson's is always perfectly tender and wonderful.

If you are downtown and looking for a good, warm, FUN meal - stop here.
