Went here last night for my fathers 60th birthday, by his request. He suggested this place because he said he went there before, he said "I had a fish dish, it was really good for the price...

I loved it. 1st of all its the best view imaginable, the food was delicious and the service was better than expected - fast, and friendly. 

 the birthday song they sing is amazing!!! I will be back.
