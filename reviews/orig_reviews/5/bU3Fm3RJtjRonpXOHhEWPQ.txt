Excellent spicy mango cayenne and rsaberry chipotle margarita.  My mahi mahi tacos were great, fresh tasting.  My husband got the mole also good with nice flavor not overly chocolatey like some I've had.  Tortilla soup was more brothy than I've had at other Mexican restaurants but had really nice flavor.  Prices were very reasonable.  Good service.
