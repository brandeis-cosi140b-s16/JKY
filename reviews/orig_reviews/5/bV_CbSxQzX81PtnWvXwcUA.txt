I'm not sure how they don't have 5 starts. But this is absolutely the BEST Mexican food you will find in phx,AZ! I have been going here for as long as I can remember! I also go to Rocky Point every year and to be honest, Popos beats some if the places down there! I love their chips and salsa (both of them) and 3 way burros!! Mmmmm definitely a must!!
