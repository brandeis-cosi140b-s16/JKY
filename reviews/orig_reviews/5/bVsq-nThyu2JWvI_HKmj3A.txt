Love this place! My boyfriend took me here for lunch & the ambiance was a treat itself being seated at a booth where we have an unobstructed view of the lake...the food was good, the server was attentive with our needs. My boyfriend ordered the guacamole dip, it's heaven! Avocado mixing w the citrusy taste of lemon & cilantro, the best! I ordered for the steak fajitas and they're soooo good! Next time I visit him in Phoenix, I'll ask him to take me here again...we are coming back:)
