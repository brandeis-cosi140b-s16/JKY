Had dinner before a concert.  Food was delicious.  As a party, we had enchiladas, ceviche, tortilla soup, tamales and bacon wrapped dates.  All of it was exceptional.  The service was friendly, the waiter recommended awesome drinks, dinner was served quickly and it was in the mid-price range compared to other restaurants at Mandalay.  Planning on taking the hubby back for date night!
