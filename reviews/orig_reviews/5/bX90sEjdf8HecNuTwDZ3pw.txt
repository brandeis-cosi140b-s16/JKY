I haven't been to this location in about a year, but last time I was here the food was da bomb! The spicy beans are beyond delicious. I always get the cheese enchiladas with rice and beans. Queso fundido is delicious. Pretty good Mexican food to say it's not California or Mexico who has the best Mexican food around. I will give them credit, it's not TEX MEX...still confused about what that even means? LOL
