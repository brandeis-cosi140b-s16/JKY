This is not only the best Mexican place in Arizona but the best Mexican place we have ever run across in the van (which is hard to admit as Californians raised on exceptional Mexican food - except Dave, the Phoenix native who discovered this place, and delights in its dominance). 

Chips and Salsa are top notch, always a good sign to start a meal. The menu suffers from the common Mexican restaurant problem of offering too many dishes. Sometimes you just want to know what they do well. and the giant Denny's menu is not usually a great sign. But to their credit, everything is always delicious. Highly recommended!
