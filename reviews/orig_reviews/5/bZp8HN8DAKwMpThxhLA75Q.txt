The food is really good the tacos are on point I just wished they had variety of salsas. The Carne Asada tacos are awesome but I wasn't so much into the salsa. It was not a deal breaker the tacos were great.Tortillas are made on the spot. The place is cool and people are friendly. 


I am a cachanilla I know good tacos de Carne Asada!
