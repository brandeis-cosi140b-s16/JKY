We went on a recent Saturday night.  Four of us were racking our brains, trying to think of somewhere different to go to dinner together. We were tired of the same old places near us, so I finally remembered about Dick's Hideaway.  The other couple had never been there. My husband and myself had been there about 4 times before, but not in a long while.
  We had always eaten at a table in the bar area, which is so cozy! But, we actually were sat in the private dining room, which we had only been able to peek into before. It was really a treat!
   we started with the roasted garlic platter, which we have ordered as an appetizer every time we have been there. It is quite a lot of food for 4 as a starter. It is amazing!! You know that you are going to pay for it  the next day, but we just can't resist!
  There were 12 specials that night. three of us decided on a special for our dinners. My girlfriend & I had the fresh sea bass.  First we got a salad included, which was very good, with a house dressing. The portion of fish was very large, and so amazingly delicious. My friend said it was some of the best she has ever had, and I have to agree. The plate is filled to the brim with a medley of fresh vegetables and their special green chili pepper mashed potatoes. My husband had the mixed grill special, which included medallions of pork tenderloin, filet mignon and a couple of lamb chops. The meats were perfect! My girlfriend's husband had the surf and turf from the regular menu, and I figure he liked his as well, since the plate was clean!! 
   I am always a bit nervous recommending to eat out somewhere that is a bit on the pricey side, but they can't wait to go back! Neither can I !!
