Well, where do I start? I have been coming here for almost two years now and have tried almost everything. I love the fish tacos, potato tacos, chicken taco, and the surf and turf burrito. Their prices of food and beer is spot on! 
   The staff is excellent. I am always greeted with friendly demeanor and have growing to enjoy coming here even when I'm not working. This place will always be a prime spot for me when I want some great food, cheap beer, and laughs.
