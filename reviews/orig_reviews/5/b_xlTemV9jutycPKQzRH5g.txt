First time we tried Bario Cafe in Phoenix and it was a great meal. Not your usual refried beans Mexican! The guacamole made at the table was a nice touch, never had pomegranates in my guacamole before! Their acclaimed pork dish cochinita pibil was superb and the pescado del mar was nearly as good. Go hungry as the portions are very generous. Will definitely visit this Mexican favorite again on next trip to Phoenix.
