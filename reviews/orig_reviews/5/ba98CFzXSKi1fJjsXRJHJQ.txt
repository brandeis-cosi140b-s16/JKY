What a great meal we just enjoyed at the Border Grill in Mandalay Bay.  We are local to Las Vegas, and like the Border Grill because you can get in and out of the place without having to valet park or use the garage, so its convenient for locals.  That is just one of the benefits, the food has always been great but tonight we had a tasting menu and we were very impressed.
I had the Fillet and my wife had the scallops as the main course, but the appetizer and deserts were just as amazing.  The price is very fair - locals ask about the VIP discount plan.  Great enjoyable place.  Check it out.
