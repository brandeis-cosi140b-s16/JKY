AMAZING!!! I ordered the Carne Asada, Chicken, & Shrimp tacos since it was my first time eating from there just to see what would be my item of choice if I were to return again. I have no clue because everything was great. Very flavorful & fresh!!! A tad bit pricey but worth it. Not sure if the cashier was flirting with me or they just have great customer service. I'll take it either way. A MUST TRY!!!
