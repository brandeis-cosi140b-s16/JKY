Absolutely excellent.  Good honest margaritas, fresh chips and tasty salsas.  Food is plentiful and outstanding. Doesn't seem to be a tourist spot, but more of a locals hangout. All of the wait staff was friendly, especially Estaban. We are only here for one week, but will return to eat here again before we leave. If you want good Mexican food, this a place not to be missed.
