Again, this is a great place that serves great food. Since they remodeled, they can seat more people. The food might take a while in the small kitchen but it is worth the wait. I have always had good service here along with good food quality. I HATE when people give places One Star solely based on the service and not the food. I understand the service goes in hand with the food but the food is more important to me. I know these mom and pop places are struggling and it is a hard business to operate just to make a living--give them a break! They are working all the time. I know most of you don't work 80 hours plus a week on your feet. I surely don't and that is why I have respect for these hard working business owners.
