This is a wonderfully cozy restaurant with spicy, flavorful and unique dishes. Why do I love this place so much- almost all booth seating w/ throw pillows, candle light, and they advertise that they do not have booster seats or high chairs.  It is always packed, you should probably make a reservation or good luck getting a table. 

Try the elephant garlic appetizer- it's kind of like chips and dip, but the elephant garlic takes the place of the chips. It is delicious and gooey. Of course, you might want to refrain if you are on a hot date. 

I've had pasta and enchilada dishes, all wonderful. It's not really traditional New Mexican, I think the menu just borrows ingredients and flavors and makes new creations.  I like spicy food, so I personally wouldn't say it is too spicy.  But, all you wimps out there might! 

This is a great place for a small group or a date (as long as you make a reservation).  A true Phoenix treasure that you must try.
