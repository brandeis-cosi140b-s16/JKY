We dined alone at the weekend brunch this trip and between the two of us we consumed 7 mimosas and 11 tapas size plates. We were served plates of fresh fruit and guava empanadas while reviewing the menu I printed from their website. I also asked the server if the chef had a special this week and indeed he did, but it did not sound appetizing to either of us so we took a pass. 

We ate, in no particular order, the short rib hash w/egg, chilaquiles, brisket omelet, churro tots and sweet potato pancakes. The weak sister being the sweet potato pancakes though the chilaquiles were not crispy as billed.  The stars of this performance were the bread pudding French toast and the fig and blue cheese quesadillas drizzled with chipolte aioli. These were so delicious an encore performance was deemed necessary. 

Our seven mimosas included a nice cross section of the ones (watermelon, pomegranate, peach, passion fruit, cucumber) being offered this day with the best in class designation going to the cucumber. Though I failed to note our delightful server's name, you will recognize her by the blue hair and assorted tattoos.

A rating of 4.5 would be the most appropriate.
