I had dinner at täkō with a friend a couple weeks ago, and I can't wait to go back and try more dishes!

We started with chips and salsa - generous portion and all three salsa varieties were unique and yummy. I had the mushroom takos as a main course, and they were SO good - easily the best tacos I've ever had and I'm still fantasizing about them! Also had a delicious michelada.

The decor is really interesting and fun. It was kind of crowded and loud, but I guess that comes with the territory for a hip new restaurant. You'll definitely want a reservation, even for a weeknight. 

I'll definitely be back!
