I went here last night for a burger and tried the standard with cheese and added the jalapenos. I loved the burger and it was definitely one of the best burgers I have had lately. The service here was exceptional, they seemed like they really wanted to be sure I was happy and it worked, They came out and gave me a free sample of their banana shake while I was eating and it was really good. I'll definitely eat here again when I'm in the area.
