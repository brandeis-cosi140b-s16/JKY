What a great new addition to central Phoenix!

Inside the historic bungalow, the bright and airy space is immaculate. Peppy Latin music surrounds you as the smell of fresh carne asada wafts from the kitchen. A selection of Mexican waters, beer and "Mexican coke" makes for excellent drink selections while waiting for your food.

I ordered chips and salsa to start. The salsa was amazing. It was fresh and you could tell it was made from whole tomatoes. For my meal, I ordered three carne asada tacos. They were fresh tasting and very satisfying. I would say they are "street style" or more similar to what one would get at Baja Fresh than Taco Bell.

From now on, I will never go to Baja Fresh for my taco fix and visit America's Taco Shop instead. With its friendly service, charming atmosphere and delicious food, others would be smart to do the same.
