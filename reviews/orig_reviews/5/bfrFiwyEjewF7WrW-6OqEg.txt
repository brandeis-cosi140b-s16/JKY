I dig this place.  Working folks and families.  Huge menu and the staff will work with you for the perfect item.  24/7 and safe.  I've been here maybe 50 times and have never been rude to, never received anything but great, real downhome mexican chow.  And did I mention the great mariachi jukebox?

spotless.

Most under $10, salsa that will change your life, man.
