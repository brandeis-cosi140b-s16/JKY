This is our first stop every time we go visit my father who retired to Las Vegas some years ago. Usually for lunch, but dinner won't disappoint, pace yourself on those chips and salsa, because the food here is awesome and save room for desert, our favorite is the flan.  Like it hot, ask for the habanero salsa, comes in a small bowl with a tiny spoon. Good heat. Thanks Frank & Fina!    Will bring those CA lottery tickets next visit.
