We've been here for lunch three times now and have NEVER been disappointed.  To start, the decor is super.  It makes you feel like you are in a little cantina along the Mexican coast.  The menu is extensive with a wide variety of choices and very good prices.  The wait staff is great and very attentive.  The food is so amazing.   We've gone to a  lot of different Mexican restaurants and this is probably the best and most authentic.  You will not be disappointed with anything you order.  The combo plates are super deals and come with whatever you choose (taco, enchilada, etc.), beans, rice, salad and a really refreshing orange slice.  We absolutely LOVE this place and will come back often.
