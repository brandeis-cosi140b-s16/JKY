Seriously this is about as cool of a vibe and as good of food as you will find at this price. Richardson's upstairs or Rokerij downstairs are both a blast! I love how many different seating styles there are, and the staff's enthusiasm is contagious. The food is remarkable - we went crazy and tried several of the $5 plates after 10pm. The spicy scallops are really hot (and spectacular) - see photos.
