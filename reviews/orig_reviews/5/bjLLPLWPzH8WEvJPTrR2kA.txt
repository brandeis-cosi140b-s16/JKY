Wasn't sure what to expect. You pull in and immediately think it's fast food. I almost didn't go in because if it. I did go in and was very pleased. The food was EXCELLENT. The chipotle shrimp burrito and steak taco were so good. Better than anything I've had on the strip. This place is a hidden Gem.
