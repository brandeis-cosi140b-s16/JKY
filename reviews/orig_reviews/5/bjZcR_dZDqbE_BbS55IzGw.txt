This is the real deal.

If you are looking for a small hole in the wall joint that serves clean, delicious, authentic tacos, this is where you want to go. It costs $5 for two a la carte large tacos served on fresh corn tortillas that are filling.

There are a variety of choices, you cannot go wrong. The meats are all prepared with strong spices, and cooked appropriately without being dry. The seafood is well seasoned, and kept moist after preparation and frying. Best of all, there is a salsa bar with over 10 different types of fresh salsas to accompany your dishes.

My only gripe is that there aren't additional "authentic" cuts of meat like lingua or tripe. But still, everything done here is done exceptionally well.
