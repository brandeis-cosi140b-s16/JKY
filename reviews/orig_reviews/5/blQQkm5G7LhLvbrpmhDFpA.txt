This place has come the closest to making the wet burrito that I love in Austin, TX. Fresh ingredients and SO MANY MEAT choices! They even let you sample all the different meats if it's your first time there. My favorite was the green chile pork and my husband liked the chicken tinga. The serving size was enormous as far as the wet burrito goes. There's also a nice salsa bar, though I did not need to add anything to my burrito... it was already so delicious! Seating is easy and clean. Their decor is interesting to say the least... you will see when you get there! Definitely will come back to try the rest of the menu.
