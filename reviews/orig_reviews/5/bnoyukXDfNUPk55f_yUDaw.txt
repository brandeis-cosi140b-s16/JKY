Excellent Mexican food! Ordered the chorizo gorditas (delicious! Didn't leave anything in the plate) tortilla soup was great! Don't order the green pozole, is bland nothing a can soup can't satisfy. The reason I didn't knocked them a star is because our waiter was kind enough to take back and bring me some beef flautas, they were the best I've had in the US. The great thing is that I never return food back because I hate the attitude they can give you, our server noticed I didn't eat it and offered himself to get me something else and came back to check on me. Overall great food and great service, I'll be back
