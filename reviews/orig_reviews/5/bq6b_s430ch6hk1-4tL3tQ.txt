There are so many fantastic things I can say about this restaurant. First off, AMAZING view during the night. Second of all, the food is lovely. They kept the salsa and chips flowing as we had our beers. Ordering was easy (they even allowed us some swaps) and the wait and bus staff was not only super-genial and accommodating, but whoever hired them has a touch for the dramatic. So many handsome guys all in one place!! A lot of restaurants in the area shove you out after you finish eating, not here. We stayed over an hour after the meal and there was absolutely no pressure to leave. Quite a wonderful place for a family dinner, a date, or just anything... it's special for any occasion!
