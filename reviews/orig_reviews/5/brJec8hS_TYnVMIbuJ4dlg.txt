I've been here many times and have never been disappointed! The staff is always friendly and they have an open kitchen so you can see your food being made fresh. The price for the amount of food you get is amazing. The most I've ever paid was $10 with tip! It's a 35 minute drive for me to get there but it's so worth it.
