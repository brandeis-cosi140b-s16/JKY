Back and better than ever! 
How do you take an already solid place and make it more remarkable?
A new sleek space. 
New furniture! 
New paint!
Stunning... I'm talking stunning stainless steel!
A really cool storefront that's a bajillion times better than the old. 

But what hasn't changed? 

Still (in my opinion) the most authentic Mexican joint we have in Madison. It's meat on a corn tortilla. With some pico and cilantro. That's what I ate for 7 years, I'm thrilled to keep the tradition alive, and I haven't found anything better in the 608. (People try though... why does everyone want to convince me to keep looking?)
