So good! Went here based on other Yelp reviews and yes, it is next to Sapphires strip club, but like others mentioned, there is a separate entrance to the restaurant. Get a margarita! They are so good and not acidic. We tried the street tacos and the shredded chicken burrito. Both delicious. Would totally go back next time I'm in town.
