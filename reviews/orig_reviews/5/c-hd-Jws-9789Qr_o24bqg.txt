If you are craving tacos go to Las Palmas. Trust me, they are delicious. I'm Mexican American, grew up in Southern California and ever since we moved here I have been in search for a place that sells good tacos. I have traveled through Mexico and know all about delicious street tacos and this place has them. My only complaint would be the tortillas. They are not that great, they don't make them on the spot like I am used to but at least you don't have to worry about your taco falling apart. Everything else is amazing, the meat, salsa, all the choices you have to fill your taco with. I hope they stay there forever.
