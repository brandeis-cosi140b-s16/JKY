Like Vic G said ... This is the BEST MEXICAN FOOD on the Vegas strip! Get the taco platter or the quesadilla, you will not be disappointed. Seriously, great food, great service and amazing prices seem to not exist on the Vegas strip! DJ Tacos makes it happen folks!!! Tons of options on menu and you can mix up. Example, undecided then have chicken, pork and beef tacos instead of 1 meat option.

Niki K and I hunted this place down for lunch one afternoon. It was hot out and honestly I almost caved in and said forgot about it. So happy I didn't. 

I ordered the taco platter with an old school big bottle of soda. She ordered the quesadilla and same soda!

Man this food is off the hook! Flavorful and finally non hotelish food! I was in utopia... 

The Taco Platter:
- came with 3 tacos rice and beans.
- I choose pork, shredded beef and chicken. All cooked and seasoned well.
- then you have sauces, lettuce and toppings to choose from.

Quesadilla:
- a lovely cheesy and meaty quesadilla slice into 3 huge pieces.
- same choices of toppings and sauces to go inside quesadilla.
- I had to assist mi lady with finishing it. Ha ha

In close all of this with tip was low $20's! I would live here if I returned to Vegas as I love Mexican food and awesome service. Check them out and enjoy people watching on the strip if you decide to eat outside. Enjoy y'all!
