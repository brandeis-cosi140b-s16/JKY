We were waited upon by the fabulous Tommy.

He suggested the cactus pear margarita, which was excellent.

He told me his favorite entree was the grilled chicken, and he added a side of enchilada sauce, Chris as style. It was wonderful!  Others in the group got the Carnitas, the Farmer's chimichanga, and the enchilada combination. The three year old rocked a crispy taco.  Everybody said their food was excellent (OK, the three year old just happily scarfed her food and then dove into her parents' dinners).

Highly recommended by a Washingtonian.
