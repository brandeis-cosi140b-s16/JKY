The best guacamole on the planet!  It also, had pozole, and a great ribeye steak.  This would be the perfect place for a romantic dinner.  It is ultrachic, and has a great wine list.  The desserts were also to die for.  The service I must admit was a bit amateurish, but I must give them 5 stars for effort, and sincerity!  What has really sold me on this place it has a good combination of street food, as well as classic dishes.  If you are looking for a great restaurant in the Phoenix, AZ area this is at the top of the list.
