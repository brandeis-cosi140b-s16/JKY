This place is one of my all time favorite restaurants. I visited on 12/9 at night before Cirque Zarkana and had a slow-paced dinner for my date and I. The food quality was just mind-blowing. The one thing I look for in restaurants is their ability to blow me away in any of several parts of the dining experience. I don't use this term loosely either. 

The drinks (jalapeno margarita and margarita that had chambord and something else in it) were so perfect. The Seafood nachos with shrimp, guacamole, dungeness crab also blew me away. A must have appetizer. My date and I shared the most tender filet and lobster tail marinated in this incredible garlic, poblano, butter sauce that made it worth the $60 it cost us. Together, the bill including gratuity for 2 cost me $210 which was the most expensive dinner I ever had for 2 people..but it was worth it without any hesitation. Props to our server for being so friendly and chatting with us and helping us decide on our selections. I'm pretty sure his name was Juan. (he was hispanic, mid 20s, and ultra knowledgable).
