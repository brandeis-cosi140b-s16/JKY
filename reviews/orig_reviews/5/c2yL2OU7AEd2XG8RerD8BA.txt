Oh, yes.  One of my favorite restaurants in Vegas, I've been coming here since it was there (in a little strip mall on Flamingo).  Things I love:

-Food - everything I've tried on the menu is delicious
-Salsa- great variety, from 1-10 chiles.  If you're a chile head like me, get the habanero salsa, you won't be disappointed.  If you're not, don't worry, there are plenty of milder choices so pick your heat level & jump right in.
-Chips- fresh, served w/mild salsa & bean dip.  Restrain yourselves, as portion sizes are quite large & you need to leave room, trust me.
-Tequila- Good selection, but pretty basic list.  Still, good choices to be found.
-Location- If you visit Vegas & want to get off the strip, great choice.  There actually is a real Las Vegas.
Service- Always solid.
