Joyride Taco House is AMAZING! We ate there last Sunday and I have wanted to eat there every day since. 
-Trio of ceviche is delicious! So so fresh and the flavor combinations are wonderful.
-Mexican street corn, yummy!
-We tried the shrimp, carne asada, carnitas, and carnitas tacos and they were all good.
-Banana pudding and churros for dessert, I'm in heaven.
-The drinks were insanely tasty. Must trys are the Key Largo and Pineapple Mojito. Also tried the Strawberry Agua Fresca with Rum. I wanted to try them all but we were so full. 
Everything was so fresh and delicious and the vibe of this place is do cool I felt like I was on vacation.
