Big Daddy and I came back for Happy Hour. Awesome as the first time.  Sat at the bar with Jeremy, who was slinging drinks, recommending food and chatting up customers better than Tom Cruise in Cocktail ( he is not old enough to know that movie.:). We had Chicharron de pollo with Miso Mustard.  The miso mustard balanced the crispy chicken.  Next was Rock Shrimp Tempura with a truffle aioli that we loved.  The secret sauce, In house made Mango Habanero sauce that Jeremy shared kicked it up a notch.  Finally we ended with the Chinese Style Crab Garlic Noodles.  Foodie food for sure.  Delicately composed, with a nice depth in flavor.  The garlic was surprisingly subtle, but there.  The spice was just right.  A dish we will order again! We will be back!  Atmosphere is crowded but bearable. We will be back!
