This place was really great.  Brought the Mrs. here for her birthday date.  Made reservations ahead of time but even so on a Saturday it was packed! They asked us to wait a couple minutes but that was no problem cuz it gave me a minute to grab a drink from the bar.  The bar was packed but the bartender still got to me a couple seconds after I walked up.  Food was really good.  Anyone who goes here has got to get the table side guacamole. It was awesome. And despite how great the food was, it wasn't back breaking.  Perfect place for a special occasion or date night.
