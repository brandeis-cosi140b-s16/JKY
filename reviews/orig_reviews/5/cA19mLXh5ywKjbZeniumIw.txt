This place has AMAZING Mexican food!!! Serving portions were big and the prices were right! Be sure to check in on YELP for a free margarita, then vote for them through text and receive a SECOND free margarita!!! Can't beat that!! 

I showed up with a friend who was having his birthday dinner there and our server "Richard" took great care of us. He was funny, entertaining, and attentive to our needs. He recommended the prime rib carne asada plate and it definitely did not disappoint! He kept the drinks coming and even showed us how to get the free margaritas on the house by voting on text and checking in through YELP.  He also recommended the sampler special and made us fresh guacamole and dip at the table side. Real funny guy also.

If you show up at dinner you also get treated to listen to their one man mariachi band on the keyboard doing his thing lol. 5 stars for EXCELLENT service. Will definitely be back if I'm craving for some Mexican food!
