So good, I had the "beach house" and LOVED it!  No need for anything other than what it comes with.  The burger was cooked perfectly, and the green chili was cooked even better.  The jalape√±o ranch was just the right amount of heat. Finished it off with a side of sweet potato tots.  Even got to listen to some Cake - The Distance as I made quick work of it all. Great experience!
