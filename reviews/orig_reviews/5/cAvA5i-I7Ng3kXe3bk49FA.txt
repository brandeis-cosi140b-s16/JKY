Seriously the best tacos I've had in a long time... maybe ever.

I know they are famous for their tortas, but it was a late night stop and I didn't want to eat some beastly, 11lbs, torta.  So, I settled on the Bistec Encebollado tacos.  

The flavor was spectacular and the meat was tender and easy to chew through.  I hate when you take a bite of a taco and pull all the insides out... 

The only downside, IMO, is that I couldn't have a beer with my tacos.  It's not enough downside to warrant a 4 star rating, but maybe a 4.5 star if that was an option.
