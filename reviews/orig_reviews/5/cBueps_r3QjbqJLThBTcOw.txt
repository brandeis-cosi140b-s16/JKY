Que sabrosa!! Why there aren't more Mexican restaurants of this caliber in the Phoenix area is beyond me. The house margarita was better than expected. My husband and I split the Especialidad de la Casa ($14.50). We got through about 2/3 of it (huge portions) and it was delicious! Tasted as good as our friends' authentic cooking. Also a festive and clean atmosphere. It's a bit of a shame that its in a rougher neighborhood. Lock your car. Otherwise, go in hungry and prepare to be delighted. :-)
