One of my favorite Mexican restaurants!
I've been here several times, but haven't tried too many things as it's so hard to stray away from my faves. I absolutely love their chilaquiles, they're amazing stacked with cheese, green chile sauce, and a runny egg. Some of the best pancakes I've had are from here, they're made with sour cream and are light, fluffy, and amazingly good with real maple syrup. Their tacos are awesome too, and are a good deal on Tuesdays. Don't miss their guac either, it's made to order and stands out due to the citrus flavor.
