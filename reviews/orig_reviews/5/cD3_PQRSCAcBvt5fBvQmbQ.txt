This is a "5 stars in its category" not "5 stars among all restaurants." it's categories are:

1. cheap very casual cafes 
2. gourmet but not haute cuisine mexican (e.g., not your local grimy Tacqueria, but not your over-priced "fusion" place either).

Here is what I had.  The quantity alone testifies to its excellence.  Asterisks after the stuff that really blew me away: 

- Elote Callejeroe*
- Guac
- Chorizo
- 4 tacos: Cochinita, Carne Asada* (2), Veggie** (WOW)
- Postre de Chocolate*
- the Tecate and lime drink
