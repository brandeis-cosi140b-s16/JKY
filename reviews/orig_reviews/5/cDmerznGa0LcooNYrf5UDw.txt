Definitely upper end Mexican food - meaning price and most importantly, quality. First of all, the service was EXCELLENT. They have either shaped up or other reviewers had bad waiters. We didn't see it and are glad we gave them a shot. Ambiance is chic and dark with a good flow. Food was well prepared. The salsa was extremely tasty with a nice spicy punch. Enchilada Poblanos was filling and had lots of flavor. Margaritas were top shelf. Would definitely recommend to others and plan to come back next time we're in town.
