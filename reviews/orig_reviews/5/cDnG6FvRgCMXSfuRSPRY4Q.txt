I was here in Vegas for vacation and I found this restaurant with the best Mexican food!! I love the chilaquiles, the green sauce was just perfect. My friends got the chicken Milanese, gorditas, empanadas.. The salsas are most delicious, LOVE the green one (perfect spicy) the service is great and the people really lovely. Thank you so much we'll be back for sure in the next trip.
