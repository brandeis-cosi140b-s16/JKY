This place is perfect.  First and foremost, the food is delicious.  I've tried 5 different kinds of tortas, and they've all been amazing.  My favorite so far is the Alahmbre with carne asada.  Their pastor is also amazing.    They do NOT skimp on the avocado, which I appreciate.  The fries are just ok, but honestly, it doesn't matter.  They have a salsa bar which has some pretty good salsa.  The green one was my favorite.  The staff is INCREDIBLY nice.  They're also super helpful, patient, and seem to genuinely want you to enjoy your time there.
