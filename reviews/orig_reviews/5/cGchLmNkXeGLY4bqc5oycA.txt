Was recommended to this restaurant by a friend.  My sis and I went in for a much deserved long lunch together and had the best time.  Our server Kellan took excellent care of us and helped by bringing us some of his fav's... we started with the pumpkin seed topped guacamole that was served with small tostada-like chips with a great spice on them... then we had the bacon wrapped medjool dates - delicious, rich, but too much for a party of 2 I must say as they were pretty filling... and lastly he brought us the mushroom tacos that were amazing!  Super fresh soft homemade tortillas wrapped around mushroom-y deliciousness!  Wish I weren't so full as I would have ordered another round of those!  Oh, did I mention the Sumo-Rita?  That was over the top delicious and worth every penny!!  I thought the menu was reasonably priced for what you got.  I will most definitely be back!  Good job guys!!
