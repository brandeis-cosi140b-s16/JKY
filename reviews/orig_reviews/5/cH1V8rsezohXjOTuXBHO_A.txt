This is a great little neighborhood taco shop! I had carne asada tacos and wanted more 2 hours later. They are fresh and flavorful and priced very well. 

They also have great happy hour specials and weekend long beer specials. I think it is like $2 for pacificos all day long saturday and sunday! Amazing!
