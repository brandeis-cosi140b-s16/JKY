I'm not Mexican (really? yes really) so I have no idea if my authenticity gauge is accurate, but I do know that I have never had a bad meal at Lindo.  The chips & salsa are exactly what every Mexican place should serve, you can't go wrong with any of the entrees, and margaritas always leave me happy.  This is definitely the place to go if you're in Vegas and craving Mexican that isn't Strip-ified.
