The food is awesome. It has become my go-to taco place in Phoenix. Try all the different meats and get a feel for the place.  I prefer to get the meat on the side and build my own tacos just because the meats have so much sauce so the tortillas can get a little moist.  The flavors are delicious and you cannot go wrong with this place.
