This place is amazing! I am visiting Las Vegas and am vegan, and when I said that I was vegan (to Frank, the owner and our server) he knew what I meant and had a suggestion. I went with his suggestion, the homemade vegetable tamales with a red sauce without the dairy, served with rice and beans. SO. GOOD. I also go the guacamole and that was also amazing! 
The staff was friendly, the place was comfortable and the food was delicious! Can't wait to come back to Las Vegas now!
