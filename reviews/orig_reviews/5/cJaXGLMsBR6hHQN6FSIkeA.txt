I grew up in AZ and I've spent a lot of time in Mexico so I consider myself to be a Mexican food expert!

Saw this place on Yelp and realized it was near my house. After reading the reviews, I decided to take a chance and have lunch with some out of town friends there.

Sitting in a strip mall, the interior is pretty sparse. My girllfriend thought we were in an ice cream store since the counter has a large selection of frozen gallons of ice cream. 

The woman behind the counter was very cheerful and made some suggestions and between the four of us, we tried a lot of the menu.

The food was amazing. The taco meats were perfectly cooked and seasoned. The nachos had flavorful cheese. The guacamole was fresh. Even the tea tasted great. The homemade salsas were the highlight. The roasted pepper version was fantastic.

Despite its pedestrian location and decoration, this place is a great find. Highly recommended.
