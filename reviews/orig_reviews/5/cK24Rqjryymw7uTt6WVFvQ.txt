Even though the prices went up a wee tad, and a few of the menu items were taken off to make way for their franchise expansion...KoMex is still one of the best!  The quality of the food is never lacking here.  And...I still get to enjoy my monster-sized Beef Bulgogi Fusion Burrito with extra, extra kim chee!  Happy mouth means I'm still happy to pay just a little bit more.  Tasty, tasty!

We still go to KoMex regularly, I'm pretty sure my wife is on a first name basis with the owner!  She never fails to take her pick-up order of lettuce wraps and Jim's Beef Fried Rice!  Fast and friendly service is the name of KoMex's game!

While KoMex does serve some darn tasty Mexican food and Asian food, you gotta go for their namesake, the Fusion!  Stick with this part of the menu and the Favorites and you pretty much can't go wrong.  I could eat just about anything on their menu with their fusion salsa/hot sauce and be a happy camper.  For me...if there's spice, it's nice!  That fusion sauce is killer!

Looking forward to their franchise expansion, but this one isn't too far from home.  I bet the folks in Henderson will be happy when a KoMex is opening near them!  KoMex...you guys ever hear of a food truck???  If so, I might want in!!
