We had our monthly group dinner at Las Velas on Sunday, Dec. 8. The space was great, bright and clean. The staff was friendly and attentive. There was a Steeler's game on and plenty of TV screens gave everybody a perfect view of the game. It wasn't the reason of our outing but still was a nice touch to the overall experience. The presentation of food was great and my fajita salad with shrimp was just fabulous! The service could have been a bit faster but since we enjoyed our conversations and chips/salsa/guac we didn't really suffer :)
Overall, everybody was happy with the restaurant, service and food.
Definitely coming back here!
