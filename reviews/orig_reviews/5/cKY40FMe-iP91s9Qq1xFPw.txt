Great deal amazing bottled beer selection. Best ICE Tea of any restaurant ever. He mixes two type of loose leaf teas and then chills it. Restaurant has great decor which were all hand made and the walls consist of all hand drawn art by customers. Tacos are EPIC to say the least and seriously CHEAP price tag. 4 tacos 2 sides and a drink is like 7.50. This meal is a LOT of food can barely finish. I always get quinoa and fried plantains which are exceptional! The owner is super down to earth and incredibly chill. He is knowledgeable about the massive beer selection. Everyone I have brought her has only great things to say about YaYo! Anyone who has anything negative to say about this place is a clown shoe.
