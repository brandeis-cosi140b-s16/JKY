This has been one of our favorite places to eat for many years! Once again, our entire family, 12, had a fantastic time. Also, Eric a manager there helped make my sons birthday very special by making a reservation for our group on a Saturday night, for the next day at noon!! Our 4 Grandchildren loved the beautiful pond with all the turtles and ducks, which also kept them entertained!! You will never be disappointed eating this delicious, authentic food!!
