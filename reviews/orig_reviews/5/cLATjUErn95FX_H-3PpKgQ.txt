As many close to me know, I hold Carolina's in very high regards as it is cheap and delicious and I have claimed many a time that it is my all-time favorite. However, until I tried La Condesa, I had no idea what the hell I was talking about. La Condesa Gourmet Taco Shop has surpassed Carolina's - nay - EVERY restaurant I have ever known. I write to you with a mind blown and blurry with recent memories of an unreal salsa bar and horchata topped with pecans, melon, strawberries, and cinnamon...  I can die happy.
