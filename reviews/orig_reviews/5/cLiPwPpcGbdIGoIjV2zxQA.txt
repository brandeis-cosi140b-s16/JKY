Stellar! One of my favorite places to eat in all of Phoenix. Sunday Happy Hour is rock solid - $5 small plates (many) and half price wine. 

The menu covers everything you could want - steak, chicken, fish, sandwiches, veggies, etc... I have eaten a wide variety of items and have never been disappointed. 

You should stop reading this and go there. Pony up to the bar and enjoy yourself.
