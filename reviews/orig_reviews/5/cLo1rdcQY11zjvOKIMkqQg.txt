This is a very casual inexpensive old-fashioned Mexican food restaurant.  The food is really great and authentic.  Salsas are delicious, and the guacamole prepared tableside is wonderful.  I had cheese enchiladas with onion both red and green. They remind me of the enchiladas that I grew up with here in Arizona.  It was a drive to get here to be with family, and we will willingly do it again simply because it is that good.  Service was great.  The menu is varied and has many seafood dishes.  We will be back that is for sure!
