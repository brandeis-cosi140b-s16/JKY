Wow. I've been hearing good things so I decided to do some firsthand research and I must admit, I was worried about walking into a completely empty restaurant. Well, let's just say that by the time I left, the place was packed and for good reason, this is *literally* the best Mexican food you can get in Champaign-Urbana. 

What I would recommend is the Tacos Mexica which are like regular tacos except there's some grilled brown cheese on there. The cheese adds a bit of saltiness, the browned part adds some crunch and the melty part underneath adds a nice creamy texture to the party. The carne asada is salty and has some nice savory bits from the char of the grill while the pastor is spicy and crunchy.

This place is as good as the stuff you'd get at little taquerias on the southside of Chicago so I very highly recommend you stop in.
