I think I found my new favorite Mexican restaurant! What a great menu of upgraded of Mexican fare with familiar selections such as street tacos, chicken tortilla soup, enchiladas, carnitas, and very tasty sangria with fresh seasonal fruit! 

However, you MUST, MUST, MUST order the the Mexican style street corn. Can you say, HEAVEN on a plate?! Morsels of de-cobbed corn kernels mixed in with a buttery tasting sauce with a little kick of spice. 

Service was good, and ambiance even better. The decor composed Moroccan style lanterns fused with gothic velvet curtains. Great for a romantic dinner for 2 or even a catching up with a group of friends. 

This one will definitely will be on the repeat visit list!
