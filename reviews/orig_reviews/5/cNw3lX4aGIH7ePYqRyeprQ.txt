Came in here with my family we all ordered different burgers and we all loved them. The burgers are juicy,  flavorful and have a nice smoky flavor. The fries and sweet potato tots are delicious. Great service and great food. Even the malts and milkshakes are amazing. Must try the maple pecan bacon malt.
