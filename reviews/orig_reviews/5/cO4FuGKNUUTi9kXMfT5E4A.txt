Proud to call Mi Patio a neighbor since moving to Phoenix in 2002.... Have enjoyed the same great food since - consistency - such a seemingly simple thing, but apparently very hard for most to achieve - Mi Patio should give seminars to other restaurants on this point.

Great atmosphere - staff on board for years - kind of a mexican Cheers - keep going and everyone will know your name.   The Guacamole Beef taco is to die for, the Albondigas soup will put your Grandmother to shame, the Margaritas are a party, and the chips and salsa are, in my opinion, the best in town - the chips are light and fresh - most of the time warm - and the salsa is the perfect combo of flavor and heat.
