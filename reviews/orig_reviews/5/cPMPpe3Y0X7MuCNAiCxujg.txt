I've been passing this place daily for 3 years. Finally stopped in for a chorizzo burrito. What a mistake. Now I know that the best breakfast burrito in the world is right there waiting. Time to either change my commute route or buy bigger clothes.
I would have stopped years earlier, but from the street it looks a bit scary.  That's obviously by design, and I wouldn't let that stop you if you have been considering trying it out.
