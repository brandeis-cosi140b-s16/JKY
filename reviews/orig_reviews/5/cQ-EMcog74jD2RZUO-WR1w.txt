First off let me just help you understand how much I love Mexican food.... I would eat it for every meal if my husband didnt protest and ask that I cook something else for a change. .. that being said I have dined at many many mexican resturants all over Arizona and today I added a new one to my dining experience! Casa Reynoso !!! BEWARE VERY ADDICITING.. I had a bean burro enchilado style with red sauce and a side of rice... it was... do I dare say it ?  HEAVENLY!!!  This is my new favorite mexican food!! The price is reasonable... but as for pretty much all mexican food it is not low fat to say the least!! But that wont stop me from going again and again... the salsa was more runny rather than chunky but fabulous taste! Not BLAZIN hot but had the perfect kick to it. . .  salsa can either make it or break a resturant in mine opinion!  I cant wait to go back!!!!
