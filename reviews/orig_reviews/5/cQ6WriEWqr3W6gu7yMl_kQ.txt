My wife and I got takeout from Komex and they were nice enough to make our order even though we arrived a couple minutes after closing. The food was delicious and what I was hoping from a Korean/Mexican place at a very reasonable price. 

My only complaint is that the menu is a little hard to read since all of the items start with the word Fusion. I get that it is the brand and all, but it is hard to scan a menu when everything starts with Fusion.
