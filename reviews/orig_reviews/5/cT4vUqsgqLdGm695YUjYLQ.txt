I think this is the best fast mexican food in Chandler or the surrounding area.  The food quality is high and consistant.  The prices are downright CHEAP.  I really like the bean and cheese burritos and the chili relleno burritos.  The jalapenos and carrots are a must and I am thrilled that they started selling Tamarindo.
