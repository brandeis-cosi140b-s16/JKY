This place is amazing! The good was delicious and different. So are the drinks. I went with a friend who was visiting Vegas, and she wanted to come back to this restaurant the next time she's in Vegas. The hospitality was amazing. The hostesses and waitresses were all very welcoming and polite. Especially miss Christina who works at the host stand. Her hospitality was extremely off the chart in the positive direction. The atmosphere of this restaurant is very relaxing. Overall, if you haven't tried this restaurant yet, do so!
