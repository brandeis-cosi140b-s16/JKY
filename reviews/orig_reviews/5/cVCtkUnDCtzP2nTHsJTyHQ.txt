Definitely make a reservation and be prepared for the darkness inside - kind of noisy too. If you don't mind those things, this place is amazing. The service is top-notch and our server (Tony, I believe) recommended some great dishes. In fact, we ordered pretty much everything he suggested and loved it all. 

First, the tableside guac. SO good. We got medium and wished we got spicy as it was barely spicy, but it was still delicious. Huge chunks of avocado and the chips are amazing - and the salsa is unique and tasty. They're also very generous with extra baskets of chips. I had a couple of their signature Primaritas, which were delicious and the rest of the drink menu looked great as well.

For entrees, we ordered the marinated jaribo chicken and the chorizo porchetta. I only tried the rice from the chicken dish, because apparently it was too good to share :) The porchetta is a generous portion and very rich, but incredible. The edges are so crispy and amazing and the garlic sauce is great. We were too stuffed for dessert, unfortunately.

It is a little pricey, but very worth it.  Fantastic place for a cozy date night - can't wait to go back!
