So, random Monday off and we wanted to try somewhere new.  We saw that Rokerij had 1/2 off wine on Mondays....perfect.  We have had bad luck with new places lately so when we walked in and the place was so dark it looked like a basement, we got nervous.  Only negative about our entire experience is that we wanted to sit on the patio, and we couldn't bc technically the patio is only for their sister restaurant 'Richardsons'.  

After our initial reservations, our experience quickly became one of our favs.  We ordered from the small plates, 3 apps for $25.  Everything was seriously amazing.  We did order a 4th app which again didn't disappoint.  Service was amazing.  Our server was really passionate about the food, saying he himself only got a job after eating here and loving it so much.  He also pointed out that happy hour at the bar includes every app for $5 and wine for $5....seriously?!  These apps are not your standard bar apps.  They include, salmon, oysters and more.  Seriously so good.  

This will be our new hang out.  So glad we found this new amazing place.  It's definitely a must.
