I don't know why I gave this a 4 earlier. I've been dozens of times in the last few years--sometimes twice a day--always loved it, never had any problems at all. I only wish there were one of these outside of Arizona so I could still enjoy it in the summer. O:-)

Besides the chicken tamales and rellenos I love the breakfast burrito. Also the vegetarian tamales are great.
