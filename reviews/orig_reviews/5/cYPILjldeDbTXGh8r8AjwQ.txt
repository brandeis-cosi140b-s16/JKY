If there was 4.5 stars, I'd give this place that since I wasn't a fan of the Skinny Margarita. But the food was AMAZING so that made up for it. We had the Chinese-Style Chile-Crab Garlic Noodles, which were great and reminded my boyfriend of the food he used to have growing up. We also had the Korean tacos which were great, as were the mussels--I'm a huge mussels fan. The ambience was great (LOVED the decor) except the fact that we were seated outside in the summer in Phoenix and it wasn't quite cool enough on the patio for that...but we got over it.
