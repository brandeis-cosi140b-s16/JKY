Great food.  We started with the cops and salsa trio,  very good,  then we had the Asada Tacos,  probably the best steak Street Tacos we have ever has.  We the had the Chicken Brass,  now this was amazing,  and I mean amazing!! I have heard some negative reviews on this but cannot see how , but I guess to each his or her own, this place is a must go to from our viewpoint.
