Look, I don't care what people say: this place is awesome. Am I biased for being Latino? Definitely. But this is good cheap food. Comparing this place to Qdoba, Chipotle, etc. is not fair. Because comparing the street food from any country versus an Americanized joint is unfair because it is not the same -nor it tries to be-. Not saying the competition is not good, just saying the style is different. The food is cheap (about two dollars per taco) made in front of you in the street. No sitting, just street food -may be that is why it is so cheap?-

My favorites are tongue and rajas (potatoes, cream, and chiles which is a vegetarian option). 

They also make tamales, which are not necessarily the best tamales in the world but they are the standard tamales you find in any Latino grocery store.

The meat section at the back certainly caters the Latino community -or those interested- as the cuts you find are the ones we constantly use, especially in Mexican cuisine.

Other than that it is a small grocery store that has products from Latin america. 

COMMENT: they have fresh baked goods (pan dulce).
