My little brother and I decided we were hungry, so I quickly yelped what was near me, and Fat Boy was one of the first to show on my nearby list.  I quickly read a couple of reviews and found that all were 5-stars. My curiosity sky-rocketed, I looked up the menu online, and we called in to order. (They were going to close in 20 minutes, but were still undoubtedly happy to take & make my order. THUMBS UP!)

WHEN: They are open & available from 10am-9pm. Dine in, take-out, delivery!

WHAT WE HAD:
-Guacamole Boyger: This was my pic, and yayyy!! I did it!! This burger was satisfactory indeed!!! If you are a fan of avocado, this should be your pick!
-Hawaiian Boyger: This was my brother's choice and of course I had to snag a bite!! This burger was like CRACK! I seriously wish I chose this burger as my first pick! It had the perfect amount of pineapple, plus that bbq sauce! Gotta love that bbq sauce on a burger!
-Chencho fries: Now this is a must try!!! You can choose either fat or skinny fries! It is drenched in that delicious green sauce and covered in melted mozzarella! NUM NUM NUM

WHY: You will not be disappointed!!

*NOTE: I was chatting it up with the dude that worked there, and I was explaining what yelp was to him. He said he gets a lot of yelpers!! Muahaha, YELPERS SPREAD LOVE!
