This is by far the best Mad Mex, for some reason the food tastes better here than any of the other locations. My husband isn't a huge fan of Mexican food, but he always finds something delicious to eat there. The tofu tacos are so amazing! The valet it great too, since parking can be crazy in Shadyside!
