I love this place! It's too bad there's only one location because I live in San Francisco and would love to have one here. The chips were pretty tasty. I had a burrito and a side of mashed sweet potatoes. My friend had the tacos and she loved those as well. It was also a lot of fun watching everyone ride the mechanical bull! Our server was very sweet and thoughtful.
