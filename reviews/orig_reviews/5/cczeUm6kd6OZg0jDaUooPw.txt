I drove from the east valley for their chocolate shake (and ate here twice in one week while i was working over here - something I never do). Awesomesauce! The shake isn't overly sweet and still has the occasional ice crystal. And the fries are some of the best I've ever had. I like the burger, but the others are the stars.
