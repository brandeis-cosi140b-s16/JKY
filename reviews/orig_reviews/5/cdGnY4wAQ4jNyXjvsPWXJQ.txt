I have been to Sumo Maya twice now and both times was phenomenal. You know how people say your wedding day is the happiest day of your life? Well Sumo Maya is better. Period. 

I split a meal with a coworker of mine and every plate we got was better than the last. 
Let me start with the lump crab guac with homemade tortillas. The crab was perfectly cooked and extremely fresh. I felt like they went into the ocean to get this crab and chopped it right out of the water. The handmade tortillas were so soft and warm and such a great pairing with the cold crab and guac.

Next we shared the pork belly ramen. I felt like I should have been in a japan. The broth was rich and the noodles were ala dente. The pork belly was fatty but that is the main reason one gets the pork belly. It was so juicy I was angered I only got 2 pieces.

We finished our meal with the duck breast served Mid Rare with pickled veggies. The Duck melted like butter in your mouth and there were hints of truffle oil on the outside.

Hands down best meal of my life.
