This place was amazing!! My wife and I were visiting from LA. I was very surprised to find this beautiful gem:) The food was so delicious my "Coctel de Camaron" was so good. I ordered it warm and it was bomb! We also shared the Camarones Al Mojo de Ajo they were fantastic! The lovely waitress was very polite and checked on us frequently. A must go! I will be back whenever I'm in Vegas again.
