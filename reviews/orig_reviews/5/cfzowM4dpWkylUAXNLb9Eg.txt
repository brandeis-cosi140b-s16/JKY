Ordered the border brunch for $35 and received plate after plate of amazing food. Great presentation. Great taste. Great environment. The view was great. The servers were incredibly nice. 

Absolutely would recommend. 

Try the fried green tomatillos, egg white oyster rockefeller, and everything else.
