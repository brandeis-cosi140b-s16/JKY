Stopped on the way back from Red Rock and wow amazing food for just running across it roadside
Bathrooms exceptionally clean
Big booths. Nice decor. Super friendly service 
I had the taco salad with steak so yummy
My husband had three tacos he said the they were all great and different but the chicken one was in a super good sauce
The rice was really flavorful 
Awesome!!
