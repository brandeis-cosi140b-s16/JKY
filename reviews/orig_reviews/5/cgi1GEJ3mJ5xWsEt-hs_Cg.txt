Growing up six miles from the Mexican border, I'm convinced "authentic" to me is not what others consider "authentic"! 
 
For being in North Carolina, thousands of miles from the border, this is pretty darn authentic by my standards!
  
It's a Sunday afternoon and the place is packed with hispanic families!  That's an automatic one star for me!!!  This usually means the food will be more homemade type Mexican food and less commercial like you would get at a Carlos O'Kelley's type place.  Then the guacamole cart comes around and fresh guacamole is made at your table!!  And BAM!  There's three stars!  The guacamole was AMAZING!!!  You get to pick all of the ingredients as well as how spicy you would like it.  

Then our orders of chile verde, a heaping ceviche (complete w Tapatio) and a combo plate of an enchilada and avocado tostada comes out just as we finish the guacamole!  Four stars!!!  The food is delicious, the wait staff is helpful and prompt.  Just when we realized we couldn't stuff out faces with one more bite, out came a perfect-sized portion of buenelos type dessert with strawberry sauce FOR FREE!!!!  And before you know it we are at FIVE STARS!  

We ate at El Charo in the same area a couple of nights ago and they don't come close to Azteca!!!  So ignore all of the stars El Charo got and go to AZTECA!!!!
