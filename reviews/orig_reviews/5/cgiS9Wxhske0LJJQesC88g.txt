This review is only for the night club part.

Looking for a mix of Latino music??? You have found the place, look no more!  We were arriving in Vegas late and we knew we wouldn't have time to get all "glamed" out, so we looked for something low key and Diego's it was (I found it on Yelp.)

No cover charge
Drinks are super inexpensive
Great Music
Open until 3P on Fridays
A little bit hidden in the MGM
