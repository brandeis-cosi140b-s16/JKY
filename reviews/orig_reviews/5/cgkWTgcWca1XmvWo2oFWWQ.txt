Went back.   This time I tried the fusion tacos.  They were wonderful.   You can taste the Korean meets with the Mexican sauces and ingredients.   It is a very unique and wonderful union of two great foods that normally you would not expect to be combined.    We also got the fried rice.   It was excellent.   Usually its hard to get a table during lunch time and thus we went a bit later and it was no problem.   The service and food were both amazing.
