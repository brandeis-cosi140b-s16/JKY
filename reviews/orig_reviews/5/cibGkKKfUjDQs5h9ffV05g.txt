What an AWESOME place to eat...total chill atemosphere, killer chips and 3 different types of salsa. BEANS OUTTA THIS WORLD.  So happy this is where we picked to have my daughters 21st birthday dinner.  The cute lil waitresses set up our surprise cupcake tower for my daughter...THANKS PINK TACOETTES.  You guys ROCK!!!  I'm counting the days when I can eat there again...and this time I'm not leaving with out at pink taco trucker hat...so i can REPRESENT in California.  Love you.
