Was starving and with my girls so we decided to come here! First time here and we ordered the chips and salsa (of course) which was very delicious btw! I ordered the pork al pastor tacos and carne asada tacos! Also with a margarita on the rocks! Their happy hour is a amazing and their staff is awesome! Kiana is a waitress and kept checking on us! So sweet! Will be back! Prices are affordable, they play great music and the food is to die for!
