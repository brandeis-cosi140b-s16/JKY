The food never disappoints; Neither does the service!

We didn't have Luis as our server this time, but he saw us, recognized us, and said hi!
Definitely a testament to the awesome server he truly is!

My husband gets the carne asada each and every time we come here.
I have branched out to other things on other visits, but I usually stick to my favorite: seafood chile rellano, as well. It is impeccable!

Well done, Viva Mercado.
We are regulars and we love this place.
