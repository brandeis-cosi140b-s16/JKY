What's the formula for good, low cost tacos in Vegas? Start with fresh-made tortillas and a variety of meats from carnitas to steak, add in a super friendly staff with plenty of smiles and suggestions, top it off with a sparkling clean visible kitchen filled with mexican music from a jukebox and you have a big winner. The al pastor with a mild avacado based salsa and a thin slice of roasted pineapple is just like being in Mexico City.  Inexpensive and good - a rare combo in Las Vegas (especially at the CES convention week).
