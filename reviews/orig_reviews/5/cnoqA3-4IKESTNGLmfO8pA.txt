Frick. This place. Yeah, it's been on Food Network or Cooking Channel or whatever. Well there really is a reason for it. Unlike other places that have gotten that notoriety and now require reservations 6 months in advance, Leticia's keeps it a hunnit. You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu. I love the quesa tacos which is their signature dish. I've always had great service. It takes some time to get your food, but it's worth it. If it were an option they might get a 1/2 star deduction for that. It's a small place so it might be busier on Friday or Saturday nights. I tend to go when I can make the trek across town which is usually a Sunday afternoon. Just something to keep in mind.
