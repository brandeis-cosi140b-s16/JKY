Just amazing, I have traveled thru Mexico, (26 states) and experienced great food, but last night I had one of the most memorable meals ever. Cochinita Pibil its a very intricate and very delicate dish, well , I was surprised and very satisfied by the results Chef Paco came out with, aside from this fabulous item we had a very juicy Carne Asada to dream for. Congratulations!!!! Your food is so fresh and appetizing I had watery mouth through out my meal. Tinga tostadas were right on point, taquitos and salsas delicious, dessert,finger licking, drinks well executed and our waiter very well informed about the dishes, great service .
Thank you for an amazing and  enjoyable evening.
Chef PACO gracias!!!
