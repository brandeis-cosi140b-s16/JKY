My wife and I used to live nearby but we left Vegas about a year ago.  Every time we go back, we always make a special trip here because it is the best Mexican food in Las Vegas.  My personal favorite is the Cochinita Pibil and my wife loves the Enchiladas Suizas.  Fantastic food and fantastic service.
