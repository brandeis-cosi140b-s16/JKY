Iv become a fan of the California burrito.  I know the California burrito is not real mexican food but it's good.  The price was right for the quantity of food.  I knew the place was authentic based on the customers I saw eating there.  The salad bar had very good green and red sauce and the pickled carrots were very good. Would defiantly come back
