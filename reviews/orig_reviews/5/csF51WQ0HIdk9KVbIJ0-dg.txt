Both times I've eaten there for lunch it has been great! Polite and quick service. The place was pretty stylish and clean. Good prices for great tortas.

I did read about the unfortunate soul below who had a slippery take out experience, but both times I ate in the restaurant. A nice mom and pop place to enjoy a good torta.
