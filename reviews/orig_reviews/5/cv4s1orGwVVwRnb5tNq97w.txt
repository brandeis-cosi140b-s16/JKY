I just got back from lunch here and this is now my favorite Mexican place in Scottsdale! The food was incredible and at a very decent price! The food was fresh and the staff were nice. The service was slower than I would have expected but nothing that was too annoying. They have a very large outside section so when its not summer time it would be nice to sit on the patio. 

We ordered the house guacamole, which was chunky and fresh. The two dips that came with it were very nice, I think my favorite would be the tomatillo green sauce which was surprisingly spicy (in the best way!). I ordered the Shrimp and sweet corn tamale which was truly amazing, so fresh and the flavors were perfectly balanced. The house rice with chorizo and pineapple is equally flavorsome. My father got a torta which he was very impressed with, and my mother wouldn't stop talking about how her al pastor pork burrito was the best one she'd had since moving here from California. The burrito isn't full of rice and other starchy fillers, its just a proper meat burrito packed with fresh flavors. The portions are large and the prices aren't bad at all, much better than across the street at Carlsbad Tavern (which in my opinion isn't much better than taco bell).

The butcher also had alot of interesting and hard to come by meats, which all looked relatively fresh. I got a center cut bone with marrow for my dog (my dog is 130lbs and eats equally massive bones) and it only cost me $3.47! So much cheaper than at PetSmart and its actually fresh.

All in all, couldn't love this place more. One thing would be the timing of the service but apart from that 100% wonderful.
