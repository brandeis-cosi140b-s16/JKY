This is my favorite Mexican Food restaurant. The guacamole is awesome. My husband likes the shredded beef tacos I love the green chile burros enchilada style with green sauce. I have tried many other things on the menu and they are all good! The salsa is great the people are friendly.
It is clean and I always know what we are getting.
