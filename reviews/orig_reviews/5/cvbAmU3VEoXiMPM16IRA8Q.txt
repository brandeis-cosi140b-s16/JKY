Great family atmosphere and fantastic food. Chips with the pico de gallo salsa is awesome! If you don't see it on the menu ask them if they can make it for you. My burrito - carnitas, potatoes and green sauce - they've made for me since opening! Maybe Roger will put it on the menu one day: the Bob Special! Ha!

Oh and for you spicy lovers - ask for the green salsa for that extra kick!

I received two jars of salsa shipped to me out of state and they came perfectly packaged and ready for the party! Order some for family and friends and they'll want more!
