My absolute favorite place to eat in Las Vegas.  Everything is delicious from the chips and salsa with the amazing grilled peppers and onions, to the delicious fideo soup, and the amazing flaming fajitas. Also, they have better service than many other much more expensive dining options in Las Vegas.
