This is one of my absolute favorite places to come eat.

I always get a frozen strawberry margarita & my boyfriend a coronarita.  So bomb.

When we're really hungry we start off with their "QUESADILLA DE HARINA" - flour tortilla with Monterrey jack cheese, sour cream, and guacamole ($7.25).

I get the "FLAUTAS" dinner - 6 fried rolled corn tortillas with beef, sour cream, and guacamole.  It also comes with rice and beans ($12.95).  

My boyfriend gets different things each time, but we have yet to order something that we did not like.

You get complimentary chips and salsa.  Their salsas are so good.

We came here a few months ago on my boyfriend's birthday.  Our server sent over the mariachi band.  They made my bf wear a sombrero as they played a song for him and then made him take a shot of tequila.  It was a really fun experience. 

The drinks are a little pricey.  I want to say the coronarita alone is like $18, if I remember correctly.
