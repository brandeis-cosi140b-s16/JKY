When I learned that PHX Burrito House was owned by the same folks that own El Sol Bakery and El Zocalo in Chandler I had to get over there to see if the breakfast burritos were as good. They are. We were frequent customers when we lived in the East Valley. Looking forward to trying the fish tacos at lunch.
