I've been to the Tacos El Gordo in San Diego as well, so I was excited to find out that there was one in Vegas when I moved here. I remember thinking that the adobada tacos at the one in SD were  great, and the other stuff was just fine (good, but not amazing). So I came to this one with the same mindset. 

Funny thing is that it kind of turned around. I like most of the other cuts of meat here; the El Pastor, Carne Asada, but my favorites are Tripa and Lengua. Tripa is a must. They get it nice and crispy, almost like chicharrones, and the texture adds so much to the taco. Lengua is really well flavored, carne has a good char flavor to it. If you want, the fries are also a good alternative, like Carne Asada Fries. Lengua fries makes it a little fattier and more savory which is also nice.

It's also close to downtown, so it's a great place to stop by before heading out there for some drinks.
