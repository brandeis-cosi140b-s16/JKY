The place is actally called Taco Saguaro   They are not cash only any more!  I was ready with cash but the party in front of us paid with cards. 

Cashier/waitress was super friendly and attentive.

No frills but delicious. Between the two if us we had taco, tostada, and burrito.  We tried all the meats. The best "street tacos" I have experienced this side of the boarder we love cilantro and there was lots on the tacos. The tostada was also delicious piled high with garnish. The burrito was also good but our least favorite of the three items. 

As for the meat we liked the carnitas and carne asada the most. Very well seasoned and finely chopped.

Being "no frills" they do not have air conditioning. We sat beneath the swamp cooler vent so we were pretty comfortable (it was a hot August day)

Thank you Yelp. I probably wound not have picked this place without all the positive ratings.
