OMG. One if the best meals in Scottsdale.  Started with table side guacamole made on the spicy side - perfect. margarita Cattalac was perfect. 
Then the skirt steak follow by the churros with side if milk shake -  perfect. 
By far the most satisfying and tasteful meal!!
I highly recommend The Mission. I WILL be back.
