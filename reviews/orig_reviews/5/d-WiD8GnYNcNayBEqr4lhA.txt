Love this place! I come for happy hour frequently and it's one of the best I've seen! $4 draft beer and $3 tacos (3 tacos to an order!). The last time I was here I came with my dad and we ordered a variety of tacos and couldn't decide what we liked better! The icing on the cake was that they carry ballast point IPA and I got it for $4 thanks to happy hour! Most places I've been to sell it for $8+/glass. Service was excellent as well. I wish I'd caught our servers name but he made some excellent recommendations without pushing his own preferences on us which I really appreciated. I'll definitely return and order the mango guacamole! Didn't get to try that since dad doesn't like mango
