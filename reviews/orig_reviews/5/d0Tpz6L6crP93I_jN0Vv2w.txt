so what the one on the strip closed. its vegas people .. drive down a bit and go to the orginal spot. Same great flavor and by far the best taco in vegas! I drive out from Henderson to eat at this place and I speak noo spanish but i sure as hell know a good street taco. I was raised in San Diego and spent many nights on the streets of TJ after hitting up the clubs.. This place is the closest you'll get without needing a passport to real mexican tacos. My belly says it all!! I can't stop at just one. If your a white and have no clue what they are chopping up behind the grill. Just ask any of the cooks and they will share a little piece of meat to try and explain what it is. I keep it simple to the carne asada and the slow cooked pork (abodabo) .
