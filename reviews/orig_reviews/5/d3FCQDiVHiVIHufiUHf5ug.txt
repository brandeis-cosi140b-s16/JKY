Great place to eat if you are tired of the expensive joints on the strip. The Potato Taco is outstanding.  Since the food seems to be cooked to order, and service is a bit slow, make sure you order all of the food for the happy hour special up front because you may not get a chance to get in a second or third order.  The owner was friendly.  The food was good. They even had food for my vegetarian.  Win all around
