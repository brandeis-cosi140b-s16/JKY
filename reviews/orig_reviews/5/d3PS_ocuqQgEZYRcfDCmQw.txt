I have been to Milagro Grill three times now and every time seems to be getting better and better. We went in for dinner this last Saturday with 7 of us in our party, we sat on the patio which is beautiful and very inviting hard to believe this was Joey's of Chicago before. We started off with a couple of the flatbreads and margaritas for the table. Let me tell you that the margaritas are out of this world, there is nowhere in the area that you can get a hand crafted margarita like these ones. For my entr√©e I had the carne asada taco's and they were delicious, cooked perfectly and seasoned to a tee! The service here is great the waiters are very prompt and everyone is very friendly. This is a MUST try if you are in the area!!!
