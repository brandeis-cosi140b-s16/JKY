Great happy hour specials. I am still not over my margarita, I tried the mango mandarin and it was probably the best margarita I have ever had. Tried the cheese y mas and it was great! Loved the salsa too! Tacos were $2 on the happy hour menu, we sampled everything plus the braised beef. Everything was on point and I can't wait to come back!
