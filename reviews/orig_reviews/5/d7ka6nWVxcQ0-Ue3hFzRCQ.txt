This place is great!  It's obvious they put care into all the food they make here.  My husband and I have had most things on the menu by this point and haven't had anything bad.  Their offerings are different from a lot of Mexican places in town; I hadn't even heard of a "huarache" before (it's like a taco except larger and in a thicker soft shell)

Admittedly, I am mostly writing this review because of the seemingly cursed location the store occupies.  Please, please go there so this place doesn't close down!!  It is a gem.
