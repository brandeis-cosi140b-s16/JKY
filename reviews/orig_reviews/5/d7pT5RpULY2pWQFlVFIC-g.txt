This is my favorite Mexican restaurant in the area. They have some interesting dishes and an impressive margarita list! If you like spicy salsa ask for the "hot" salsa, it's very good. The service and food are consistently good. This is a favorite amongst our out of town guest as well. Tia's serves up great food and great atmosphere!
