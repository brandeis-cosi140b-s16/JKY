This place is great!  We stumbled across this gem as we were starting the trip back home from Las Vegas.  Yelp gave this place good reviews so we decided to give it a shot.  When you walk in you will realize that it doesn't feel like your typical Mexican joint.  There is no mariachi music playing and no Mexican flags on the walls.  Instead there are musical instruments mounted as decorations and pleasantly soft background music.  The restaurant itself is in a little shopping plaza by a gas station.  It has a clean, newly remodeled feel to it.  Enough with the atmosphere... We went to the counter to place our orders and had the privilege to meet Phrank the owner.  He was a super friendly guy and welcoming.  I ordered the shredded beef and my wife had a vege burrito.  Everything tasted fresh and had nice, balanced flavors.  My burrito was a nice size and not overly huge like some places serve.  I will definitely make this a recurring stop for future Vegas trips.
