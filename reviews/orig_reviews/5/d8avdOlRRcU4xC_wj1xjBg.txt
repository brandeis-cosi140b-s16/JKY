idk why this place doesn't have 5 stars from everyone?!?! everything is DELICIOUS.

best fajitas in the whole world. not even joking. I have a hard time ordering anything else so I don't. but I have tried other things from friends and everything has been awesome!

they have this tequila-infused butter that they serve with stuff and it's insane. and they have the most delicious onions with their fajitas. the tortillas taste freshly made. the complimentary chips and salsa are super great. 


worth coming here for every meal.
