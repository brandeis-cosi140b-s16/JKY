This place was fun and friendly.  The service was great.  They were a little behind in the kitchen with one of our orders and the Chef came out to apologize.  He then came back with the food.  Okay, it is not gourmet, but it is good.  The breakfast was delicious.   Good drink specials, good food and very friendly service from the cashier to the chefs.   I will be back.
