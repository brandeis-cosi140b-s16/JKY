Their ribeye tacos are delicious. Their presentation of the meal as well as the culinary accoutrements accompanying the dish are well made and well flavored. 

Their flan was not too sugary and therefore hit the spot. However, I prefer mine more eggy.

Anyway, they sell all sorts of Mexican gastronomic googahs like pastries, ice cream, and Popsicles.

Over all, it's a piece of swank at inexpensive prices on Dunlap. This business, singlehandedly, will jump start the gentrification of this seedy area.
