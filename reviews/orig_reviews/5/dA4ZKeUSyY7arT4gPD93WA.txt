Favorite tacos ever!  My wife loves the shrimp tacos,  I like the halibut tacos, but we both agree the seasonal veggie tacos are the best.  Go during 3-6 and they're half price.  Also,  the elote is yummy.  Grilled corn with cotija cheese, paprika... explosion of flavor.  Service does take a little while tho
