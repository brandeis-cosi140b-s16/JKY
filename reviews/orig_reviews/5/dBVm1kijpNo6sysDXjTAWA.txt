PERFECT!!

  My husband and I just got married in Vegas 2 weeks ago and had our welcome party at La Salsa Cantina and it was AWESOME!! They did a spectacular job. They were so nice, extremely accomodating and even the DJ they use (Yameel) was terrific. Waiters were on top of everything. Before I was done my beer they were there with a fresh one in hand :) It was the best and whenever we make it back out to Vegas we will be visiting again! 5 stars all the way :)
                                                                        Thanks!!
