The customer service was honestly some of the best I've ever had and the food was amazing. The woman at the counter was super sweet and had great customer service. There was honestly not one bad thing I could say about my experience and I would highly suggest going there if you want to try something different. The green chile you cannot find anywhere in town and the carne adovada was bomb bomb!!!!
