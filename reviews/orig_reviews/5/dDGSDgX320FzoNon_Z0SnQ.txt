Amazing food and service! Everyone is so pleasant and attentive, the food comes out hot and fast, and all the ingredients are extremely fresh. The Wholly Guacamole is made with fresh avocado and cilantro and limes right in front of you at the table and it's so cool. I get the Arroz con Pollo every time I go and it's only $6.99 on Fridays (!!!). Best Margaritas in town - go Tuesday because the Fishbowl Margs are only 5 bucks. This is my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh.
