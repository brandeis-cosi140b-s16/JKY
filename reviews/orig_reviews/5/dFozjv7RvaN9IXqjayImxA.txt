I Have gone here many times, nothing but A+ food and service. Frank is an amazing person he greets most by name and can even remember what you usually order. He interacts with everyone and makes sure everything comes out aces, which it always does. The Adobada torta and Flautas are my personal favorite. The chicken in the flautas is so tender and juicy and packed with flavor. Everyone needs to experience this amazing restaurant. Very accessible as well, since it is right off the 215 freeway on S. Decatur and W Sunset.
