Ok
I LOVE this place.

Wussies beware though, its rather spicy.

My favorite are the flautas appetizer.  Its enough for a meal for me.  Two large flautas are stuffed with cheese and beef, then drenched in a delicious red sauce.

MMMMMM!!!!

OMG
They also have this berry chimichanga type dessert.  I dream about it at nighttime.
