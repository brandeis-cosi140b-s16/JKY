This new location is wonderful and you can BYOB and they have reggae music periodically.
Service always good, meals are wonderful, seasoned perfectly and pretty. Truffle is amazing. Chips and salsa awesome, not poured from a jar. 

I like the adult centered atmosphere.

THey have an awesome quinoa vegan soup!!!!   I had the vegan chorizo tacos. The texture great but it needs to be seasoned more. It tasted sweet and bland.

We love coming to this place. It has good vibes and always tasty food. THe food is expertly prepared, not just thrown together like a lot of places.

THis is truly an original!!!!!!!!!!!

Small portions that really satisfy
