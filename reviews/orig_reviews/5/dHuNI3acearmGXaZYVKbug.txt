Prices are good. Food is awesome.. The wait is not that long! I love their salads from back when I would go to St George for one! My favorite is the pork salad, but I have recently discovered the Salmon Salad- it's amazing!! Got to get your frequent card- free meal!! Love Mint Limeade and Strawberry Lemonade.
