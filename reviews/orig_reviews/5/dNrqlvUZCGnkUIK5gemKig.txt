LOVE LOVE LOVE this place and the patio. The happy hour margaritas are always on point. I normally sit outside on the patio, they have great misters and big shade umbrellas. Last time I went I got the steak bowl with brown rice and with the salsa that comes with the chip and salsa app made a perfect fit. Even when I've been here with a large group (8+) the service was AWESOME. Will be returning! :)
