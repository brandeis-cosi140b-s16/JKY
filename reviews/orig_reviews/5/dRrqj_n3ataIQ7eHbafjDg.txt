I just swiped 5 stars, and want to add about 10 more.  Get here.  Get here now.  Hurry.  Don't delay.  This is the 3rd Molinari restaurant in the area that I have been to (see The Side Door and Uncle Sal's) and holy crap do these folks have it down.  This is a non-traditional Mexican place AND BUTCHER, and the food is absolutely indescribable, and you know from my other reviews, I am a food snob - particularly with this type of cuisine.  So reasonably priced it is silly.  We started with the Pig Wings (mini pork shanks) and guacamole with chips, and the freshness screams off the plate.  Three tacos and the shrimp and corn tamale later, and I was weeping with joy.  Super fresh ingredients, combined like a well tuned orchestra; and the sweet and spice in the tamale was literally the best tamale I have ever eaten.  I do not know how they get away with such reasonable prices.  The place is small, but not crowded or loud.  It is so clean, you feel like you could eat off the table or floor - but not too sterile!  It's dimly lit, but not too dark; and the staff seem to really enjoy their job!  They are attentive, friendly, thoughtful, and greet and visit with diners like family!  The butcher was closed, but I have heard good things!  Seriously, this place is an absolute don't miss.  Next time, I want to eat outside, on the super-inviting patio with the fountain.  While the view might only be a parking lot, it is truly charming.
