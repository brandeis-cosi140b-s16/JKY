I visited PAZ last night for a little Taco Tuesday.  The tacos were very good!  I ventured out and tried a cactus taco which is something I've never had before, great for vegetarians!  The hand squeezed house margaritas are a fantastic deal....and a little stronger than they taste.

The layout of the restaurant is great and I liked effort to display and support local artists.  

I'll definitely be back!
