Definitely 5 stars.  We loved this place so much we ate there twice in two days!  
The salsa selection was awesome, the peanut was a strange choice that we had to try and it was really good. 
The margaritas are huge!  I recommend the blackberry!
Very authentic food, so hard to find these days!  Just the kind of place we have been looking/hoping for!
Atmosphere is great, rustic and fun.
We will surely be back!
