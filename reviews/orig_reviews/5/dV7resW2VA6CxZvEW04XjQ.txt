Absolutely wonderful !!! We went as a large party of 22, and we were taken care very well. Our waiters Christian and Angel were kind and helpful and knew what we needed before we did. Another STAR of the experience was NOE one of the managers. Always made sure we were well taken care of. We are all looking forward to returning , and making apart of our traditions. Thank you Lindo Michoacan from the hostess, managers, waiters, helpers, and even the mariachi's the night was magical.
Gracias por todo, La Familia VEGA
