I've always been a fan of Mad Mex - endless burrito combinations and their margaritas outpace almost every Pittsburgh restaurant - so when I found out they started a prix fixe brunch I had to try it! Only $12 for a meal and a breakfast cocktail (or even a margarita!) 

I ordered the carnitas Sunday Street tacos with a Mad Maria. Amazing flavor with the cilantro and loved how they accompany them with over easy eggs for dipping. They give you four tacos, but they are pretty small so you're not in a complete brunch food coma when you leave. The Mad Maria (Bloody Mary with Tequila) was a nice twist from the standard drink and was the right amount of spicy.

My friends ordered the chicken and waffles and the steak and eggs skillet, both of which they recommend. Especially if you sub over easy eggs on the skillet.
