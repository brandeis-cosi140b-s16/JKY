At first when I saw this place in Luxor the signage made me think it would be more like a hooters type place so I was not expecting much.  I was wrong.  Me and my partner eat Mexican every Friday so we chose this place.  The service was astounding.  Not only were we seated promptly, but there was little or no wait for anything.  We both had the Acai Pomegranate Margaritas.  They were amazing, so much so we asked for one to take with us.  The food was excellent as well.  From the Nacho's to the Taco's we enjoyed every bit of it.  

On a side note, after our meal we told the server how much we liked the food and how we frequent Mexican restaurants more then we probably should.  He took the time to review the whole menu with us for future visits.  You could tell he had a great amount of pride in the restaurant, which was a nice change of pace. This was really great experience and I think we have found our new Friday night Mexican place while we visit Vegas.
