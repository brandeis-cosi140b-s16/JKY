Had a great time at this place. Seated promptly on the patio with our two kids and our server was great. Got us chips and salsa quickly, along with water, so we could keep the toddlers occupied.

My wife had the Yucatan Pork Tacos which the waiter recommended. No leftovers for me! She obviously loved them and was very happy, since we were having lunch a little late after going to the Mandalay Shark Reef.

I had the Chicken Poblano Enchiladas which were fantastic! The charred, smoky flavor from the poblanos is unforgettable. I'm still thinking about it now. I also had a bloody mary with lunch which was really good.

After reading some of the other reviews, I think next time the wifey and I will have have to do brunch here sans kiddos!!
