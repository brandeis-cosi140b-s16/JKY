This place has been my favorite Mexican restaurant for my entire life. The cute little duck pond and cozy lighting make it perfect for date nights. My favorite dish, by far, is the pollo fundido, however, the dish is a lot smaller than it used to be for the same price. We will definitely be returning the next time we are in Cave Creek.
