On a business trip here from LA as my wife was doing an event the next day here in Phoenix.
Our hosts recommended Asi Es La Vida as a quaint Mexican Restaurant with wonderful food.
Wow, we were NOT disappointed, not by the great authentic food, nor by the warm and hospitable service provided by Irving, a class act of courteous and professional service.
Wish we had this restaurant and Irving in OUR neighborhood in LA !
Next time in Phoenix, will definitely be back
