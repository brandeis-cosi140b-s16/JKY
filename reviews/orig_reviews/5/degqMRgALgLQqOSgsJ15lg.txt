Straight out of the car from Salt Lake City. We didn't stop at the hotel. We didn't drive the strip. We set the GPS coordinates for Komex and as road-weary travelers, peeled ourselves out of the car and ambled in to the restaurant.

We don't get much (read:any) Korean-Mexican fusion in Salt Lake, so I was really looking forward to seeing what exactly it was. The food around us smelled terrific, and after eating right for days on end, it was time to splurge. Spend those calories!

So what does a fella order when he wants to taste around? The bulgogi burrito, of course. Oh, and then a couple of tacos as an add-on to taste the other meats. One dak-gogi and one daeji-gogi, just to be safe. 

It wasn't pretty the way I unhinged my jaw and swallowed that whole burrito. But it wa oh-so-delicious. The side of kimchi made all the difference in the world, too. Beautiful, baby! And the tacos were tasty as well. I favored the pork over the chicken, but really--it was all unique and bursting with new flavors.

I also got to sample the vegetarian noodles which had a slightly smoky flavor and were served in an approximate 47lb. mound. Portions are generous here, and there's plenty o' bang for not hardly a buck.
