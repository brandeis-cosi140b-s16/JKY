My first attempt to try this place out was on a SUNDAY...it is CLOSED on Sundays. Bummer. So had lunch and it was great, really, really great. The food is simple, delicious and sticks to ya, ya know what I mean?
The flavor is hard to describe probably because I have not had such fresh, tasty Mexican food like this...ever. 

So, would I ever stop and have lunch here at a gas station if I did not hear that it was so great or have seen them on the Food Network? No.
But I will definitely make the trip back. The number 8 was the 2 tacos with beans and rice. I had a chicken and beef and both were equally tasty. I added the salsa to the tacos and it just added more flavor to the whole experience. 

AND I had to give it 5 stars so to help push up the 4 1/2 stars it is averaging!
