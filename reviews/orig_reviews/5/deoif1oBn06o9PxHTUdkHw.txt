It's nice to see an El Gordo on the Strip!  If I get a little too drinky, I can just take a taxi or the Duece to the north end o' the Strip.  As a tourista, I just feel a bit safer here than at the Gordo on Charleston.

I was at Tacos El Gordo on a Saturday afternoon and decided to strap on the feed bag:  one adobada taco, one cabeza taco, and a small order of carne asada fries.

Sadly(?), something got lost in translation between the beef guy and the fries guy and I received a grande order of carne asada fries.  Yikes.  They only charged me for a small order, but still...

I devoured the tacos and made a pretty good dent in the carne asada fries.  Couldn't stop eating them, even though I knew I should.  

Had to nap up for a couple of hours after getting back to the hotel due to a carne asada-induced coma.

Lost a couple of hours of gambling time, but I won't hold it against Tacos El Gordo.  Everyone is very friendly, even to a gringo gordo such as myself.

Five stars.
