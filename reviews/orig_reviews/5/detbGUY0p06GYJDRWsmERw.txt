Being a chef those are some of the best tacos i have ever had sure i could make them myself but why there great!!  the value is there the flavor is there. I promote them to all my friends ..As a chef i am very picky!! I have crossed off more restaurants lately because of sucky food so Go to YAYO Tacos for some killer grub if you like HOT ask for there Hot creation its smokin so beware..and beer and tequila list is huge
