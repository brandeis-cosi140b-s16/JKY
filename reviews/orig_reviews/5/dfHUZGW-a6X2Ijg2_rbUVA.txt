Had an awesome lunch here today. I got the machaca burrito and my husband got the beast burrito chimi style. I recommend their burritos. The chimi style means deep fried burrito. You can also glaze your burritos with cheese!! Awesome! This is my second time here and I remember not enjoying their tacos last year so I didn't order them this time.
