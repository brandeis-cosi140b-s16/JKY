Far and away my favorite Mexican restaurant in AZ.  Food is always fast and great, carne asada is spot on and everything is delicious.  Always leave full, happy, and when off the clock with a little buzz on.  Great place to bike to as it is close to the canal path through central Phoenix.  Good for Breakfast lunch and dinner.  I don't live close but it is worth the drive. 

Cool patio when the weather is nice.  Middle of Sunnyslope just south of Hatcher, if that is too much of an issue for you well than thank you for leaving a seat open.
