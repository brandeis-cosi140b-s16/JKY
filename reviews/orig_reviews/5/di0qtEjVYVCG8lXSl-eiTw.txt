GREAT cheap eats here! They have a 3 Soft Tacos with a drink special that is not only cheap ($7.65 + tax), but absolutely delicious! For the life of me, I can't understand why anyone would eat at a Taco Bell when they have Pepe's Tacos--for starters,  the ingredients are fresh here, and I KNOW that the meat I'm eating is REAL chicken. You can see the cooks preparing the food, and they not only offer the common fountain sodas, but the cool horchata, jamaica, and pina drinks.

They also have a jukebox loaded with cool tunes.
