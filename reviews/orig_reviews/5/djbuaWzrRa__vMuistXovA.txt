I have been to this place once before and did not have a good experience the food was ok the service was crap but this time it totally made up for it. Our bartender Crystal was an absolute pleasure her spunk and personality made me want to stay there all day just to see what she could come up with next as well as Mark his attention to detail and expert customers service guaranteed that I will be back with friends. I did order the vegan nachos and o m g they were the absolute bomb I'm really excited to find a restaurant that has vegan options on their menu (more than side orders and meatless versions of their meals) thanks again for the amazing service you all deserve a rise. Be back soon  Jazzlyn
