As an ex-pat from Oklahoma, it's hard to find Mexican food that meets my standards in Pittsburgh, but I was very pleased with the barbacoa and especially the carne tacos. Their guacamole and salsa verde is also very good. The portions are small and expensive, but worth it for me. The only other tacos that beat this place is the taco cart.
Atmosphere is very comfy and the patio is really nice.
