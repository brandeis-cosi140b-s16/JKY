205 reviews and a good 4 star rating... not bad to the folks of Mi Patio.  I went there again today for the first time in many years (I lived out of state and moved back to a part of the valley that is far from here.)  Anyway, whoa... we could not complain or "meh" about any single thing.  There was NOTHING wrong.  Prices were fair.  Service was not just excellent, it was whatever comes above excellent.  And the food was really, really good.  Nothing from a can.  Salsa was dam*ed amazing!  Big chunks of meat in his meal.  No skimping on anything from them.  I hope the good folks at Mi Patio get more 5 star ratings because they deserve it.  4 stars isn't enough.
