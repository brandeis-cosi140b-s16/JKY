Really great dinner last night and our waiter was easily able to help me navigate my allergies. I was really impressed given that they're part of a chain. The jicama salad (butter lettuce, grapefruit, jicama, avocado) was wonderful and so were the braised beef soft tacos. Good service, over-all good experience.
