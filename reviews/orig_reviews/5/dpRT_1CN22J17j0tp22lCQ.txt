Absolutely one of the best Mexican restaurants I've ever visited. This place serves very creative and eclectic style Mexican food. Most dishes aren't what people would traditionally imagine. One of my favorite dishes is the wild mushroom enchiladas. They are super tender and come covered with a light green colored sauce. Very mellow flavors. They have a vegetarian torta with a thick slice of grilled tofu, and typically I'll only eat tofu if it's in miso soup. One of my absolute favorites is the pezcado veracruz. It's the 'catch of the day' in a marisco (red) sauce with rice. Imagine a fish stew, with a large cut of fish in the middle. The Vaquero beef rib is also excellent. It's a well prepared short rib in mildly spicy mashed potatoes. This restaurant is the ONLY restaurant in The Venetian that is located directly on the canal. Whenever we went, we always were seated directly next to the canal. The wait staff is always super friendly. Although the hostesses have often been unfriendly and will take forever to acknowledge your presence. Their drinks are pretty good. I recommend the sangria by the bottle. It's fairly inexpensive and very good. Not a bad way to pass an hour or so, sitting with your sangria at the canal. I think a lot of people are expecting a different style of food here. It's more of a gourmet style, with interesting interpretations. Don't expect a big sloppy wet burrito. For the amount and quality of food, I consider this place to be cheap. Entrees are around the $20 mark and they charge for chips and salsa. But the portions are generous (not gigantic) and the food and atmosphere are second to none. You would be hard pressed to find a better location than this, in Vegas. I highly recommend for a late breakfast/early lunch, when they open around 11a. It's also nice to eat at a place when I don't have to get dressed  up, seriously I am on vacation, don't make me wear something nice.
