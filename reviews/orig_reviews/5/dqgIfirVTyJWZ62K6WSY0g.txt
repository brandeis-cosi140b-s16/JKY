My wife took me here for a surprise Date Night out and What a Find. The Guac with Pomegranite Seeds was a great touch. My wife had the fish tacos and I had the pork and steak, It was just like being in Rocky point only safer and better. The atmosphere was great we went on a thursday night and had a great time, got seated fairly quick and the place was crowded and upbeat. You have to try it you will like it!
