So good.  Fresh, quality Mexican food and (by Vegas standards) very inexpensive.

The chips and salsas were great.  It was different to have a variety of salsa to start the meal.

The one thing that really stood out was my entree.  I wish I hadn't gorged on the chips and salsas, some guacamole, and an appetizer.  The mushroom entree was one of the best things I have ever eaten.

Service was good.  So was the atmosphere.  We ate outside and had a nice view of the lazy river.

Anytime I am in a city with a Border Grill, I will go there.  What an excellent experience!
