when a visiting friend says lets meet for lunch. somewhere local! I was like ok we are going to Nacho Daddy! 
It was a hit! it was myself and 5 other ladies and everyone left happy and full.
there was a mix of different nachos ordered but i will focus on my own due to i didnt try anyone elses.
I had the nachos florentine. It was amazing with the spinach chips and creamy cheese! sundried tomatoes and i think proscuttio. I had indi size and it was perfect. as you know with nachos if not eaten quickly they tend to get soggy so no left overs but i will be having these again. 
and they had lil appetizer corn muffins to die for!
