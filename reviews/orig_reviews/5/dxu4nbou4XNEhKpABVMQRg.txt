What happens when Mexican and Chinese food fall into a kitchen together? You get Chino Bandido!! I love this place! For first timers, the menu might seem weird on how to order since you fill out a paper and add what you want or create your own bowl, plate or burrito-esque dish, but the staff will help you and if you are not sure what to get, they offer samples to taste!!
My favorite is the jerk red chicken(kind of like orange chicken with an attitude), side of rice, and black beans, cooked to perfection! Every order comes with their famous snickerdoodle cookie that is to die for and available to purchase 6 or 12 pk. DIne in or takee outee(as their sign says). Love it!!
