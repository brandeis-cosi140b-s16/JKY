One of THE best places I've had Guacamole at... if not THE BEST... Its tableside... and soo soo fresh.. it was devoured !  The chicken tortilla soup was AMAZING  different with ancho chile ?? but oh so flavourful... Margaritas on point and the staff remembered our names as we had to come back the next day for more Guac!!!
