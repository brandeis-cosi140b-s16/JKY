This place is the best. I saw this place on man vs food and we decided to check it out on our way to Cali. Boy I'm glad we did. Hands down my favorite sandwich spot in Phoenix. To make things even more interesting Adam from man vs food was doing another episode on his show the day we showed up. 
I was loving it. 
It's kind of messed up how they moved all the regular customers to one side of the restaurant and filed on the other.
Anyways, food was delicious and so fresh. They give you a lot of food for the money. We've been here twice and I promised my self anytime I'm in Arizona this is gonna be my first and last stop before I leave Phoenix. 
It's a tiny restaurant so be prepared to wait for 15-30 mins depending on what time of the day you show up. It's still worth the wait.
