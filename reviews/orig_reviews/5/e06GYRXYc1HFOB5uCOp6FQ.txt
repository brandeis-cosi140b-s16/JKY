Great place to grab a good burrito!

This is an awesome restaurant.  The food is amazing.  Portion sizes were great & the atmosphere was amazing.  While having dinner we witnessed a proposal in a gandola.. The outdoor seating gives it a romantic, elegant atmosphere.  The staff is friendly and truly dedicated to their customers.  Ensuring the best quality of service!  Great place to dine!
