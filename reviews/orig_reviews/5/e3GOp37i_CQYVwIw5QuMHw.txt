Cabo never disappoints! My personal favorite menu item is the epic tuna burrito (rare) and the avocado pasta salad side! The pasta salad is so delicious I have requested the recipe before and the server was more than willing to offer it. From behind the bar the Bloody Mary is a must try. The bartender took special time to make them to the spice level that my boyfriend and I wanted. Warning: the corn salsa they start you out with is very addicting! This restaurant is a must try if you have never experienced it before.
