I dont eat fish tacos.... But I ate 4 of them here.  Torilla Fish's full taco will change anyone's opinion, even your taste buds! Everything is cooked to order so the fish comes out perfectly crispy and delicious.  All of the toppings are on the side, which was almost my favorite part.  The avocado sauce was my favorite.  The customer service was absolutely perfect.  This place definitely earned the title of best fish tacos in the Phoenix area.
