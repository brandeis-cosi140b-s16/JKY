This place is awesome! Friendly staff, and fantastic grub.  I had four soft tacos (steak)... They were delicious.  Good ingredients, made to order.  I have not been so impressed with similar small Mexican fast good joints ( like Filiberto's or Los Favoritos)... The quality at those places is not good, and sometimes the food is just questionable... Not so here!  Julia's rocks!
