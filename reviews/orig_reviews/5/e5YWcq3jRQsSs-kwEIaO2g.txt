I'm another Man vs Food follower and this place lived up to the hype! I don't usually order tortas at Mexican restaurants (too many soggy buns and mashed up flavors),  but after watching the show my wife and I had to hit this place up while visiting my family in Scottsdale. They have a HUGE menu to choose from and the four of us took forever to decide as they all sounded amazing. And....all four were! The atmosphere was pretty cool and we had good service, but when it comes down to it, we'd go back for the food even if everything else stunk. It was THAT good.
