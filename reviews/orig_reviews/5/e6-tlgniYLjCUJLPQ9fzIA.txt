taken directly from my blog -- one of the new things I am doing this year is, I want to pick out really cool interesting places to eat when we travel. This time I picked Barrio Cafe in Phoenix because I had read great things about it and seen it featured on the TV. Let me just say, Wow!  My publisher was speechless from how good the food was. I was so happy, because being the only female on the team, means, I only get one chance to make a good impression, if they hate it, that's it my vote is revoked forever! lol. I ordered Chile Nogada, Chef Sylvana's signature dish. AMAZING! My boss had the cochinito poblano, I tasted that dish as well, my God, I had no idea meat could actually melt in your mouth! If you love great food, this is the place to try!!!
