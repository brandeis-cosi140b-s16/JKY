Awesome food, cheap drinks, fun servers - what more could you want?   We're from San Jose, so only get here occasionally, but it's a don't miss, especially for breakfast.   We had the combo (1 eggs Benedict and two enchiladas with red & green chile and the enchiladas where you can pick any 3 of their six options.   Bloody Mary is pretty spicy, but mimosas were good too, and only $5 each.   

Dick's is a bit hard to find, but there are pics posted of the sign above the entrance - I think it just says cocktails and parking in rear...

Monica was a great server too!
