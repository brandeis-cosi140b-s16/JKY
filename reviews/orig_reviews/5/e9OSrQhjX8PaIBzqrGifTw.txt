I've had all their Tacos and they are all excellent.  My favorite are Cabo Shrimp & Oaxaca Black Mole Tacos.  The best way to enjoy the tacos in this place is to put them into rotation like in baseball and do the same with the multitudes of creative salsa.  The worse thing about La Condesa is their tacos made you wonder what the hell did you eat at Taco Bell.
