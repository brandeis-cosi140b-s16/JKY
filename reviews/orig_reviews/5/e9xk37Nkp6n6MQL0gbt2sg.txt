Love this place! Generous portions, workers are wonderful, and flavors are great! This location isn't close to my house but the new one on Warm Springs is. I tried the Warm Springs location and I was so disappointed with the employees & portion size there. I figured since it's new I'll wait another month or 2 to get it together like the Rainbow location. 
But this location is awesome!
