I LOVE this place!!! Not only is it fresh but the quality of the food and the FLAVOR is astonishing. There is absolutely no doubt in my mind this is the BEST place for tacos and their Mexican food.
 I agree with some people mentioning it's pricey but seriously, it's reasonable. I mean, you want quality food then you pay for quality food. For instance, it's like Mortan's Steakhouse, if you order a rib eye steak, you going to pay at least $100 at Mortan's for one. But the quality and flavor is there and thats what keeps you coming back for more. There are so many cheapsakes out there that rather eat crapy food for cheap and complain about this place, instead of comparing the quality of food to other places and realizing that this place is actually reasonable.
 Also, the variety of the food they offer is exceptional. Always FRESH!! Made for the vegetarian, the meat lover, the kids, and of course for you and me. 
Furthermore, the customer service here is phenomenal. I happened to meet the owners wife(and mother of his children) and not only is she appealing and charming, she was extremely delightful, young and reverent. I haven't seen her recently (which I hope she comes back soon) but it's ALWAYS a pleasure to walk in and see her there smiling lovely. Her helpfulness is gratifying and you can see how it rubs off on the other employees. It's great to know that this is a family owned business working together. The relaxed, at home ambiance of the restaurant is always captivating. I recommend this place immensely. You can NOT go wrong by coming here and eating.
