This place is amazing!!! A nice hole in the wall place that doesn't allow for a lot of foot traffic. So you can go in and have a  nice lunch solo or with a few people. I have been here only once but can guarantee the service this place has to offer!!

The guy behind the counter is so nice! he's very mindful! I didn't have to wait too long for my meal and I was able to soak up the atmosphere. 

Try the chicken club, very delicious!!! 

I definitely recommend this place to everyone!!
