Loved it! loved it! loved it!  No, I really loved it.

Took my lovely little girls there for lunch in the big city and based on Yelp recommendations, decided to check ths place out.  So happy I did.

Started with chips and salsa.
Perfect.

Had carne asada burrito.
Perfect - especially with the stuff in the squeezy bottles!

Kids had burrito and quesadilla.
Perfect.
And, FREE!!!!  Can I tell you how much I love free food?  Right there on the menu, typed in so they can't change it, and no asterisks, it says that kids under 10 eat free. Everyday.  And it was all day happy hour, so my little family of $3 dined out for $10. Shut the front door.

Needless to say, I will be back. Many times.
