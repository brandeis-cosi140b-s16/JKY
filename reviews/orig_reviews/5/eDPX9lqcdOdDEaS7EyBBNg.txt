Having dined here for nearly 6 years ....  Raising my children here every now and again we would feel like regulars.  All excited to say what we wanted, down to how many pieces of rice and beans with half and half chicken/steak on our burrito bowl to share.  

Today I went in alone because my children are grown.  It had been at least a year since I was there with my boys and the manager asked how they were doing.  She recognized me!  All those people she sees everyday, and she remembers me and my boys!  That says a bunch about her relationship skills.  

My middle son, Justin T. Webb, had passed away when a wreckless driver failed to yield before turning left and I shared that with her after she had asked about them.  She was touched and insisted on buying me my lunch.  

As usual, the food is fresh, the chips laced with sea salt and lime, and the interpersonal relationship skills of the female manager here was a "10"!  

Thank you for remembering us!
