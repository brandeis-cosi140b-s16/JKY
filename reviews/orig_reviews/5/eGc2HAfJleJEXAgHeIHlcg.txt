Cafe Rio, where do I start? This place is one of the better Mexican places that one can go to. It's set up like most "fast food" Mexican places. You tell the person what you want, pick your meat and toppings and then pay at the end. The service is usually good and they aren't stingy with the toppings.

Now for the food. Mark my words. Cafe Rio has some of the BEST Barbacoa on this earth. Whether it's in a burrito or topping a salad or nachos you can't go wrong. I've tried the fire-grilled chicken and steak and it just can't compete with the Pork. If you order a burrito you can get it enchilada style (covered in sauce) or regular. The burrito is huge and almost enough for 2 meals. The salads are definitely enough for 2 meals. Just yesterday I ate the greens out of the salad for one meal, then rolled it up into a burrito for a 2nd meal. The nachos are amazing. Loaded and nice crispy house-made chips.

These are great, but they can't even compare to the greatness that is Cafe Rio's Queso Dip. Once you have it, it is life-changing. I like to call it spackle for your insides. Once you eat it, it fills every nook and cranny in your stomach leaving you full and satisfied. It's hard to put how good it is in words.

So go to Cafe Rio. I guarantee you'll find something there that you'll love.
