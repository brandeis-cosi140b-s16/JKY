WOW! I just moved to Phoenix a few weeks ago and this place is near where I live. I decided to give it a try. You walk in and the staff is very friendly. They proceed to give you samples of all the meats they offer. You are almost full from all the samples! The food is great! I typically get the "street" tacos and all the ingredients are fresh. They are now expanding the restaurant and adding a bar. I know where I'll be hanging out...
