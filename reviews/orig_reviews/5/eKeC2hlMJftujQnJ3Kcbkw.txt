This place was absolutely delicious!  We went here on a suggestion from a friend and it did not disappoint.  The guac as previously stated is fresh and delicious, the margaritas and sangria were good, but the mojito was AWESOME!  The burritos were humongous and delicious and the chicken enchiladas were amazing!  I definitely recommend going here while in Vegas.
