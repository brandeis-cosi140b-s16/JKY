Remains my FAVORITE New Mexican style Mexican food place.  GREAT drinks, and fantastic food. I have NEVER had a bad meal here.  Tonight had the sampler appetizer with lobster dip, shrimp, and some of the best crab cakes ever.  For dinner; the tenderest steak and a side chicken enchilada--wonderful.  It's the various sauces that they make that enhances ALL of their food.  For the sea food they NEVER use imitation and the pieces of lobster and crab were LARGE. The prices are a bit on the higher side but for the quality of food I'l keep going back.  Love their margaritas and the Ferrari is my favorite.  Service is EXCELLENT and all of the staff remain some of the friendliest ever.  This location---there is more than one Blue Adobe--remains the BEST.
