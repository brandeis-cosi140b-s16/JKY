So yummy and the burritos are MASSIVE!!! Plus we had an awesome waitress! She was so sweet and helpful! 

During the 5 days we stayed in Vegas we came here twice! My mom really enjoyed their food and that's saying a lot because she's a picky eater with all her medical problems. This will definitely be a place we'll have to stop by every time we come to Vegas! 



Ps~ They serve breakfast all day! :D
