We had a bachelorette party there on 11/13/14 with a party of 13. Living out of town wasn't sure how the restaurant would be. 
  Needless to say we had excellent service, food and of course the drinks! They even gave each of us a free margarita and shots of tequila to the Bride to Be. We were also driven back to our hotels in their large van. Amazing night!!! We will definitely be back!!! Thank you so much.
