Look, you want authentic Sonoran style mexican food like Arizonan's are used to then Carolina's is the place.

Best tortillas in town. LOVE the machaca, tamales, even the 2 beef taco combo!

The place is constantly packed yet she can still afford to be closed on Sundays. Normally, that would be considered restaurant death but not for Carolina's. What better sign do you need?
