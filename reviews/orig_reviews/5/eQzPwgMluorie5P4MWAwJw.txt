I love yo rita.  Their food is phenomenal.  I have never had a bad meal there....  there were a couple occasions my chips tasted stale :( but other than that the food is excellent.  Love the new mushroom taco ( sad to see the velvet taco go!), but if you like meatballs...  I would recommend the bison albondigas.  We always sit at the bar and the bartender is always attentive.  Thanks!
