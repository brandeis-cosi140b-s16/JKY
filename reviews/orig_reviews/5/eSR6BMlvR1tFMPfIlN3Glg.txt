This place is amazing!  Short and very simple menu, and simple but great tasting food.  Tried the carnitas burrito and it was just perfect.  It has a slight crispiness to it without being over cooked.  The portion is big enough that I almost didn't finished it, but the food this good can't go to waste so I decided to chow it all down.  I really can't comment on what the place looks like inside because I'm so busy and so focused on stuffing my face with food awesomeness.  No doubt that it's probably one of the best Mexican restaurant I've been to.
