Great value & delicious food!  Been there quite a few times now.  I have only tried burritos and the wet burrito.  Setup is similar to Chipotle, but Santos Lucha Libre has more options and better food.  I love Chipotle, but to compare Santos to Chipotle is a slap in the face to Santos.

They have a sign out front that reads "1 pound burrito".  My burrito was massive, so out of curiosity I weighed it...1.5 pounds!

Cons:
- Their restaurant is themed around professional wrestling, so they have masks all over the place, and it's creepy as hell!  Because of the decor, I could never eat there; I always get my food to go.
