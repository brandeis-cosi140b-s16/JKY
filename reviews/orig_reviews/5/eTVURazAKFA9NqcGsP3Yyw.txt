I would like to preface my review with a little background on me. I was born in Phoenix 33 years ago. Over the years I have tried hundreds (if not thousands) of Tex-Mex restaurants in Phoenix, the U.S. Southwest, and Mexico itself. 

The first Tex-Mex I ever had was at this Los Compadres. I have had everything on the menu more than 20 times. How I feel about the food at the 7th Avenue Los Compadres I can only relate in analogy. It is Garfield's lasagna, Bert's oatmeal, Laestrygonian's lotus, Olympian Ambrosia, and Elvis's peanut butter and banana freakin' sandwiches all wrapped into a burrito, and gilded.

Do not get this and the sister restaurant confused. There is NO substitute.
