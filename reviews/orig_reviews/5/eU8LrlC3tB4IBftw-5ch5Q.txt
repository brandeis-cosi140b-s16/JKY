This place is old school and definitely ligit. The customer service is extremely awesome, the portions are enormous, and the atmosphere is great. The only complaint I might have is that I sometimes I get different things than what I ordered. I say might because I still haven't eaten anything there that I don't love. They also give everyone a run for their money in the "best salsa in town" department. Also don't mind the free drinks.
