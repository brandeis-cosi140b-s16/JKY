This place isn't as bad as some of the reviews are saying. Think of this place as an Applebee's or Chilis with a nightlife scene. The staff was very friendly and the food was good. The prices actually are comparable to ANY family style restaurants. Check this place out and see for yourself that it's a pretty cool and different scene for the strip. Also their $20 wristband all you can drink menu is off the hook.......!
SHAAAAAOOOOOW!!!
