This is Mexican food like you've probably never had it before.  None of that chain-restaurant scrap here.  Chef Silvana is top freakin notch.  They don't call it Comida Chingona for giggles.  It is a bit pricey but well worth it in my book. Have the tableside guacamole.  The put pomegranate seeds in it when they're in season.  Margaritas are en-pointe without any icky sweet and sour in them.  You may have to wait, but it will be worth it.
