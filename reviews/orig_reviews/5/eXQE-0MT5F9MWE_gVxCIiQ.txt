Again a great dining experience at la hacienda at the Fairmont Scottsdale. This time we sat in the dining room and our favorite table is 11. It's in a little room with a fireplace. Please don't get stuck in the large room! My wife had the organic margarita and I  had their house. Both great on the rocks (in Hawaii you mainly get it blended).  We again had the guacamole made chair side and it was awesome. Well skip it next time as we need to have something different for an ap. The great find that night was the deep fried sea bass. For dessert we had their sorbet of mint chocolate chip and vanilla. You get three scoops of any combination from about five different flavors. We made reservation for the next evening but got distracted shopping at the Kierland Quarters.
