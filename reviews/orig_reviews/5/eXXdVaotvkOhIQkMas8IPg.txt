I have been to this place a couple of times.  It is a hole in the wall in Sunnyslope, not fancy at all, but the food is awesome!  This time we had the Torta Nortena de Pollo and the regular size Shrimp Ceviche Tostada (both items shared between two people).  I also had a  delicious pineapple Agua Fresca.  I was glad we did not each order a torta because it would have been too much food.  The torta was very good and the ceviche was heaping and tasty (we ordered it on two tostada shells instead of one).  Great value for the price and service staff was very attentive.  Try it out!
