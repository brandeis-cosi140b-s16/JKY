My overall experience at this restaurant was fantastic. I had the Bulgogi Burrito and it was phenomenal. Great tasting, fresh ingredients. The customer service was above-and-beyond what I have experienced from other restaurants. Very attentive and friendly. 

Also, the staff mentioned the possibility of another satellite location opening on the south end of town. Yes!
