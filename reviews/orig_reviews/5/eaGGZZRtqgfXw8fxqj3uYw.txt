My boyfriend and I decided to try this place after work and LOVED it!!! 
I think our waiter name was "Israel" and he was so so helpful, funny, and courteous. Not only did we get free seconds on the bean dip and salsa, we got free soup too! He also hooked my boyfriend up with a flavored margarita instead of the regular house kind. They also helped me with certain Spanish words and answered all of my annoying questions! Lol! We even got our picture taken and printed on a free coupon! 

The food was excellent! No complaints what so ever! 

The restroom cleanliness was about a 4 out of 5.
