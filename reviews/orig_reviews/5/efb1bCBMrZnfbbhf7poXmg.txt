I've only been to Mucho Gusto twice, once in 2008 and most recently this past weekend and both times I have been completely blown away by the service! I am a restaurant manager and both times I've visited I have wanted to hire my server on the spot! Very friendly and attentive, funny too! The patio area is great when the weather isn't too hot! 

The food is good but it's the service for me that will get to go back the next time I'm in town!!
