We are Fox Restaurant regulars and consider Blanco one of our favorites.  The Happy Hour is great and the drinks are amazing.  While I love the Margaritas, my new favorite is the Paloma, which is made with grapefruit juice and is really refreshing.  The chicken fajitas are delicious with a great onion and pepper saute.  They are so moist, plentiful and flavorful.  The staff is amazing and the atmosphere is fun and lively.  We have truly noticed a difference since the addition of General Manager, Chelsey Dever.  She makes you feel like you are coming to her home for dinner.  She is always smiling and friendly and takes hospitality to a new level.  While we love the food at Blanco, Chelsey is the reason that we come back each and every week.  Thank you Chelsey!  Keep up the good work! Nancy C.
