I love anything with raw fish so I decided to give this place a try & see what all the hype is about. 

Atmosphere - Really clean, simple setting restaurant. 

Menu- Easy to read with lots of options. 1) you could either customize your own burrito 2) pick a roll that's already customized. 

Food - I got the redondo and it was delicious!! It came with tuna, salmon, and yellowtail (Fave fish). 10/10 they always make their own soy sauce which was more on the thick side but really good!!

Would definitely come back here again to try everything else!
