I'm a big fan of fish tacos, and rarely does a restaurant get it right - I recommend the Mahi Mahi, although I would have liked a stronger taste of mango in the salsa .  The quality of the fish was good (hard to find in the desert), calamari fries were outstanding, the wait was staff attentive, and the owner personable.   Nice decor inside and out, SFTC has captured the feel of being in places like Newport, and Redondo Beach and brought them to the desert.
