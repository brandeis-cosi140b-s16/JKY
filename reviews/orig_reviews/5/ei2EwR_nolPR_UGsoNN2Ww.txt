Real Mexican food and ridiculously cheap prices!  The cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing.  It is like eating the most melt in your mouth pot roast ever.  It may be a but mushy for some.  Carne asade was good.  Pork wasn't as good.  Arizona Burrito was hearty... lots of potatos cheese and steak.  The green sauce was tasty, the red was not.  Minuto was interesting, but I wouldn't get it again.  Just fill up with delicious tacos for under $1.50 each!
