Located 2061 West Sunset Road Henderson, NV just off sunset and sunset.  This location is just a bit hidden but just and welcoming as the other locations.  On this trip I ordered that same as the last just to check the consistency factor.  I must say my No. 9 Cheese Enchilada & Beef Taco was every bit as good as the Lindo Michoacan location.  The Sala again was the start of the meal.  I think we are going to make these out new favorite Mexican Cuisine locations.
