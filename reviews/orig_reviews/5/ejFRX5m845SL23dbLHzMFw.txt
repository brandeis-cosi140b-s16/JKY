This place was amazing. A bit of a wait, but that's because the food inside was worth waiting for. I ordered the chicken enchiladas with tomatillo cream sauce, and I thought I was going to die from yumminess overload. I mean, it was one of the best things I've ever had in my life, and it was DEFINITELY the best enchilada I've ever had anywhere, ever.

The guacamole made at the table was fresh, and the addition of pomegranate seeds was a little curious, but ultimately delicious. 

The service was top notch, coming to check on us a few times, and again...the BEST enchilada I've ever had. Amazing.

A little pricey, but it was worth it. This is a special occasion place for special food, in my opinion. Loved it, and 5 stars.
