We stopped in for happy hour.   Within walking distance from the suncoast casino on a nice day.   Fabulous food, reasonably priced (considering half off) and our server Kelly was excellent. 

We tried the standard Margarita on the rocks,  mango and strawberry margaritas.  I usually prefer a standard (theirs is top shelf), but the fresh strawberry flavor made it my winner here.   

For appetizers we shared three tacos and the flatbed.   It was fantastic!!!!
