After multiple attempts of trying to get a reservation, we finally made it through the doors at The Mission. The ambiance is very nostalgic and it actually feels like your are in a mission. The first thing we ordered was the guacamole because it had been raved about on Yelp. It definitely lived up to the hype. It is prepared table side and you can decide what you want in it and how hot you want it to be. The next things we ordered were the Crispy Pork and Cola Lime Glaze and the Grilled Street Corn off the cob. They both were amazing and I couldn't see how the meal could get any better. For our entrees, we decided to get the Malbec Braised Shortrib and the Tecate Skirt Steak tacos. Both were unreal. The Shortrib was soft and fell apart so easily but remained juicy and tender. It was served with a smear of queso fresco and fingerling potatoes. The tacos were delicious and surprisingly filling given their size. I could taste how fresh the tortilla was and the steak was grilled perfectly. We also had another order of the Grilled Street Corn because it was too good to only have once. To top the meal off, we got the Espresso Churros and Pumpkin Bread Pudding. The Churros were served with a milkshake and the bread pudding was served with a scope of vanilla ice cream. Both were scrumptious and ended the meal perfectly. The experience was terrific and the service was on point. Our server knew the menu from front to back and helped us decide on all of our delicious dishes. Even the bus boys were friendly and polite. I now have a new favorite restaurant in Scottsdale and see why it was so hard to get a reservation all this time.
