This place is really a hole in the wall, literally the space between two pieces of drywall.  There are no restaurant signs.  After going up and down 16th street, I put my stubbornness aside and called Dick's to find out where they were located.

Their plates come out hot like straight from the oven.  I tried the eggs benedict jalapeno.  There was a good size cut of meat on the benedict.  Including the potatoes, beans and tortilla made it really filling. I also tried the carne adovada and eggs.  The pork was nice and soft with a lot of flavor.

This place is definitely worth trying.
