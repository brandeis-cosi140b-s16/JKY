Gallo Blanco is a great addition to The Clarendon Hotel.  Locals and out of towners alike can enjoy both the hotel and the restaurant.  (and if you let the hotel know you're a local they will give you a 10% discount - my favorite staycation spot!) 

Gallo Blanco is the perfect place to go with your family or friends for breakfast on the patio on a beautiful day. It's also a fun date night with your special someone and great for girls night out at the same time.  Very versatile. The decor is entertaining (the ladies lips shaped men's urinal I've heard about? hilarious!)  

Let's talk about the food, shall we?  The Naco Torte is my favorite sandwich anywhere in the entire Valley!   If you want healthy options, you can try the oatmeal for breakfast or the shrimp tacos for dinner.  mmmm (I just salivated a little writing this...)  There's a key lime tart not on the menu that is ah-maz-ing!  

On to the drinks now. Grab a drink and go hang by the pool or in the rooftop. For the non-alcoholic drinks, you must try the agua frescas. So fresh and delightful.  This is also the place to go for a little day or evening drinking because their cocktails are very tasty -  go for "El Ruso" or "El Julio" - my favorites!  (we even recreated them at home, but definitely not quite as good).  Happy hour is 3 - 6 and the prices are great.   Can't beat this delicious food, great ambiance and cool place!
