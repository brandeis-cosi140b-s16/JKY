We are staying at Tapatio Cliffs and I will write my review on that place next, which believe me won't be good. As far as this restaurant, AWESOME food!! My mom ate at the restaurant 12 years ago and remembered it tasting amazing. She was right!  The restaurant had a lot of locals/ regulars than the typical travelers, like ourselves. The servers knew a lot of the people by first name, so that's pretty cool. My 12 year old nephew ate every last bite of his 3 taco carne asada plate! He said it was the best Mexican food ever. My 5 year old son had the open faced quesadilla and ate more than half (which is a lot for him), my step daughter ate every bite of her bean and cheese burrito. I had the veggie fajitas and there was so much food! Plenty for two people to share!! The veggies were fresh with carrots, onions, asparagus, green beans, potatoes... Such a mixture but believe me it was good! I'm not a meat eater so it was delicious for my liking. My mom got a fish dish that was delicious, cooked perfect with great flavor and not fishy tasting at all. The staff was friendly and welcoming even after my son spilled an entire water all over our table ( we actually had to move tables). We didn't go to the restaurant for decor, we went strictly for the food. So if that bothers some yelpers that's their opinion. Small and dated would be the only negative but I would still give this place a two thumbs up.
