barrio cafe is the best mexican restaurant that mexicans never go to, which is too bad for my people because they're missing out. best thing i've had there is the cochinita pibil. when you're waiting for your table (always a long wait) at the bar (always crowded) order an icy cold michelada with extra chipotle tabasco. mmmmmmmm.

addendum:
- attention mexican-americans: barrio cafe serves food that is VERY similar to what is served in nice restaurants in southern mexico. just because there are white people eating at barrio cafe doesn't mean that it's not real mexican food. and just because you've never heard of most of the dishes on the menu says more about your level of exposure to mexican food than it does about the restaurant.
- attention non-mexicans: yes, mexicans IN MEXICO eat fries. no, rice and beans are NOT served with every meal IN MEXICO. and i'm not talking about rocky point or cabo. i'm talking about MEXICO. in fact, rice and beans on the same plate is usually only seen in the US.
- attention burrito eaters: stay away. this place is too fancy for you. don't waste your money. you wouldn't appreciate the food here anyway.
- attention everyone: yes, barrio cafe is expensive, but so are most nice restaurants. just because you're used to eating $6.99 combo plates doesn't mean that all mexican food is like that.

please, everyone understand that the "mexican food" that is served in 99% of the restaurants in texas, arizona and california is VERY different from what people actually eat in the country of mexico. don't go to barrio cafe expecting anything like what you normally eat.

honestly i'm just shocked at all the comments about how barrio cafe isn't "authentic".
