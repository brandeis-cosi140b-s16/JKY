Fantastic street tacos on the strip of Las Vegas. Now let me tell you why I gave 5 stars...
1. Either the owner or the manager that was there on Wednesday night 07/29/15 was an awesome guy, he talked with us, cleaned up after us and made sure all was good. 
2. It is hard to find inexpensive good food on the strip, you can find mediocre medium priced food and mediocre expensive food and very good expensive food, but he has a gold mine in that little place. Will definitely be back.

Now... To be perfectly honest any street taco I have ever bought is about a buck or buck and a half, he does charge more per taco but you gotta consider where he is located so take that into consideration and enjoy your tacos.
