GLUTEN FREE options available. I also love that this is authentic Mexican food and it is organic & non-GMO! 
The menu has a GF label next to naturally gluten free options. Always make sure to let the waiter know if you have a gluten allergy. They are very accommodating and are more than happy to see if additional items can be made gluten free if they are not labeled on the menu, such as enchiladas, paco mole sampler, and flan!
