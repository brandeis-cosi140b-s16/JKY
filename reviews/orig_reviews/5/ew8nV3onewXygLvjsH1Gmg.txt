Unreal!  

Who would have thought that North of Las Vegas you could find a Mexican paradise. The food here was so good...I blew right through my New Years diet and will likely come back again tomorrow for the same. 

The service is impeccable and the staff are on it. Whether the live music is every night, or I just got lucky...it was perfect. 

Try the carnitas!  But beware the bean dip and salsa will have you almost full before the meal arrives. 

Loved it!!!
