Honestly had an amazing experience here at Braddahs.. The food was good but honestly the reason I will be coming back is "mama tea" .. This was my first time eating here and when I walked in she greeted me with a huge smile and walked me through the menu and gave me a few samples... She ended up recommending me her fish tacos which I had and they were amazing ...you just don't get friendly service like that in a hole in the wall here in Vegas these days ...
