Excellent decor, very small with a great "Mom n Pop" feel, beautifully painted and warm, and the food trumps all those compliments.  AMAZING SEAFOOD!!!!!
Try everything, I loved the oysters and the Crab Enchilada. I grew up in Maryland and I am a picky crab lover there is, this seafood gets 5 stars easily.
