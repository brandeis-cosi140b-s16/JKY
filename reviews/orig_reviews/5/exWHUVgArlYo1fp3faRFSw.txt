Second visit to Three Amigos, this time to celebrate a birthday and treat some out of town friends.  It was just as good as last time, though this time we had an easier time communicating with our server, who informed us that basically anything they make (enchiladas, etc.), we could get with their grilled veggie mixture instead of meat.  SCORE.  She recommended the enchiladas verde, which was FANTASTIC.  I could slurp their verde sauce with a spoon.

Plantains once again instead of rice.  Seriously, they should just forgo the rice and serve fried plantains with every dish.  It could be their signature.
