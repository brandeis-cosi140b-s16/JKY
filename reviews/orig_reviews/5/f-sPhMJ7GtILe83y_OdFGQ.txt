I love this place amazing service very friendly, quick food great drinks.Food was great after I ordered a churro as my desert and it was cold and very hard I asked the waiter to please exchange it with something else. They kindly exchanged it and they still brought me fresh made churros so delicious! The waiter, chef and owner personally apologized. Will definitely come again
