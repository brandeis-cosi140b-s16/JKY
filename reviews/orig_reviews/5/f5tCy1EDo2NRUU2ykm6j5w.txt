My new favorite place for Mexican food! When I heard there was a new Mexican restaurant serving a taco with a fried avocado on it, I knew I had to give it a try! When hubby and I walked in we were greeted by a woman who took us to a booth and took our drink order. When you walk inside there is a decent size cantina on the right and the dining area on the left. I noticed the dining area half full of customers so I took this as a good sign. The chips, salsa and bean dip brought to the table were delicious. The salsa could have been a bit more chunkier for me, but it tasted very fresh and good. 

I ordered "Tacos Del Campo" priced at just $8. This was 2 tacos with beer battered fried avocado, jicama slaw and pico de gallo in them. It was just so yummy! This wasn't like any dish I have tasted before and I will be ordering it again for sure. It also came with rice and beans. I'm pretty picky about rice at Mexican restaurants and really liked it here. The rice was moist and had great flavor as the beans. All this fresh tasty food for only $8 is a great deal. Hubby ordered the "Casero Burrito" priced at $13 and had some issues with the order accuracy of his food, but enjoyed it and really liked the tomatillo salsa that came on it. His food also came with a side of guacamole and since he is weird and doesn't like 'cados, I scooped it right up! That guac was definitely fresh made and freaking tasty! Our server was great and checked on us for refills regularly. 

Jalisco Cantina has a few different options as far as catering. They can host up to 100 people at the restaurant with live music and either a sit down dinner or buffet style dinner. They had other options too, but I can't remember them all so you can call for more info.

Currently they are open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
