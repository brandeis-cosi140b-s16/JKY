First time here but not my first experience with a breakfast burrito. First of all, the place has been cleaned up and and looks clean and nice. Second, the staff is super friendly in a neighborhood shop kind of way. Third, the tortilla was super fresh and the eggs and potato burrito was delicious. It tasted like my mom made it at home. I'll definitely be going back and recommending others too.
