Great experience both times I went. They make the burritos right in front of you and you can either choose from a menu or make your own, which I'm not ballsy enough to do. The location is slightly awkward and they get busy quickly with not that much seating to accommodate. But their product is worth it, super fresh, delicious, and filling. Their home soy sauce is perfect, and I recommend their taro chips and queso to go with that burrito. Enjoy!
