Taco Blanco's staff really goes out of their way to welcome our family each and every time we visit. The food is consistently fantastic. My favorite things range from the delicious taco platters with freshly baked flower tortillas to the margaritas. The classic margarita with the three generation tequila is superb. Great restaurant to have in our neighborhood!
