This place has amazing tacos . I have probably been to almost every taco spot in town and figured we would give this a try with such great reviews. I am so happy we did because this is by far one of the best taco spots we have found in phx.  We ordered all the shredded meats and tried 10 diff tacos total . They were all amazing . This is not your Carne Asada grilled taco spot so don't expect that kind of taco. This is marinated meat that has alot of flavor and many choices . Staff was so friendly and let us try all the different meat choices which made it hard to chose because they were all so good. I highly recommend this place . For those of you who left bad reviews just keep going to taco bell because you don't know good tacos
