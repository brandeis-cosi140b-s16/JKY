This place was great! It is a smaller locale yet roomy.  The waitress was attentive and very knowledgeable on the various menu items. I went with a preparada with modelo beer, it was perfect! I usually end up adding lime or salt to prepapradas, not this one! They brough It out just like I Like it!  I ordered the mariscos molcajete.  It comes out sizzling hot in, it is also super hot to the touch so be careful!  They also bring hand made corn tortillas.

There is a thick layer of delicious white cheese, once you poke trough, you reach the delectable broth and perfectly cooked and seasoned seafood such as shrimp, octupus, scallops, crab leg, crab meat, clam.  It also has onions and bell peppers adding to the perfectly crafted flavor.    

They bring out a plate with white rice, beans and lettuce.  The beans and rice are SO GOOD, best beans and rice in a restaurant I've ever had!
