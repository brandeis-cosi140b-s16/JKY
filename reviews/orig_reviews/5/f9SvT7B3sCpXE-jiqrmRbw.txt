Great fun here! If you're staying at the Flamingo you have to eat here and come for the nightlife on the patio. If you aren't staying at the Flamingo, then still get here. Charlie and Cowin in the kitchen are amazing and Dave on the patio bar is the shiznit! The food is authentic and served with the utmost care. Order the guacamole and watch it be made right at you table or the bar. Nothing compares!
