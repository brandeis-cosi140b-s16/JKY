Had lunch here yesterday. Tacos were great. The Ensenada Battered and Citrus Grilled Chicken were fantastic. Our server Adrienne was great. Very knowledgeable and made some great recommendations on appetizers as well as bringing us the "on request only" habanero salsa. Will definitely return when I'm in Vegas again!
