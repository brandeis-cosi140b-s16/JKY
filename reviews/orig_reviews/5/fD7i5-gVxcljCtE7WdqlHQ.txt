This place is freaking brilliant!  LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!   It's a must stop whenever I'm in the Phoenix area.  The homemade tortillas are a must - get a combo and get at least one thing as a burrito.  My go to is the egg foo young burrito, pollo diablo burrito, jerk fried rice and black beans. Sometimes I'll switch it up with the jade red chicken too.

The snickerdoodles are fantastic as well.  Staff are super friendly and everyone in there will help you with ordering if you don't know what you're doing.
