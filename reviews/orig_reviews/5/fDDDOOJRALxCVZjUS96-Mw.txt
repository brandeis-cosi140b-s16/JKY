I had been hearing about KoMex from fellow yelpers for weeks. The idea of blending Korean and Mexican food has been done before but not like this. 

Tucked away in some  stripmall near the Meadows Mall, KoMex doesn't look very impressive on the outside. Its a small restaurant, definitely a 'hole in the wall' which does not deter me at all. In fact, the casual mom n pop abiance really adds to the experience. 

The menu is actually quite extensive offering Mexican, Korean, and Chinese food. However, the fusion items are really what this place is all about. KoMex offers all different kinds of Korean+Mexican fusion dishes. Everything from tacos, burritos, and even bulgogi fries (kinda of like carne asada fries but with a slightly sweet and tangy Korean beef). I strongly recommend the bulgogi fries as I have never had anything like them before.

What really makes the place awesome is the fact that there is no dish over $10. 3 Tacos, bulgogi fries come put to about $10. Another thing I love, is that when you order water, they give you free bottled water, not tap! On top, they offer free chips and guac (usually its just chips and salsa). Throw in the free yelp check in deal and you have a pair of great appetizers. 

The service is pretty good, the small set-up makes it easy to get a hold of your server. Also the fact that the place appears to be family run gives it that personal touch. 

I think KoMex really embodies much of what Yelp is all about, finding great places to eat off the beaten path which one would not normally thing about going.
