Been hearing ads on the radio for this place for the last few months and finally got around to getting there this weekend.  I was expecting a small hole in the wall of a restaurant, but it is a very nice building in a strip mall.  Very nice and clean place.

Now on to the food.  It's great.  I had the carne asada, al pastor, and carnitas taco and they were great.  My friend tried the tripas, chicharron, and not sure what the third taco was.  The chicharron taco was good, but very spicy, so spicy he was sweating.  The horchata is some of the best I have ever had, nice and creamy and not too sweet.  Good selections on salsas and beers on tap.  

After reading some other reviews, there is no way I'd rather eat at Chipotle than Taco y Taco.  A note on the lines.  There are 3 lines in the back and they are clearly marked as to what meats you can order in each line.  I have been to other taquerias that have the same set up, and I have never found it confusing but that's just me.  Just look at the monitors above the counters and see what meat is served in that line and move from line to line if you want different items.  

Be definitely coming back again for more.
