Seriously some of the best tacos in town! I like the carne asada tacos and mulas. You get in the line for what meat you want and drool while waiting for your turn. The lines can be long since everyone else wants some of this goodness too. Seating inside right now is limited but it looks like they are making more room for seating so that's good. What I'm hoping is that they get more stations going to help with the lines. Tacos are $2 and come with onions, cilantro, and sauce unless you specify otherwise. I ask that mine be made on flour tortillas and they do it and don't even charge extra. You can get a side of free grilled veggies upon asking too. Really good food at good prices.
