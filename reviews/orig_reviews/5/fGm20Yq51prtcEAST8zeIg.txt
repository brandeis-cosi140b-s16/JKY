The breakfast burritos from America's are my go-to when I need a quick and hearty breakfast on a Sunday morning. My favorite is the chorizo with potato and egg, but the carne asada breakfast burrito is a close second. The restaurant is within walking distance from my house, so I stop in at least once a month. They are always super friendly and super fast. Don't ever change, America's!
