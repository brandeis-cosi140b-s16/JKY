As far as cheap breakfast goes, this is where you need to be in Vegas! $3.95 for 2 eggs, choice of: ham, bacon, or sausage, potatoes with peppers and onions, and choice of: flour or corn tortillas. Add a coffee or bloody Mary for 99 cents! Total bill was $5.26. And I got to make my own breakfast tacos! Wish I had another day here to come for breakfast tomorrow. 

Nice tequila selection if you're into that too. They have all kinds of specials and deals all day.

To get there: (we couldn't find it yesterday) go into the miracle mile shops near planet hollywood (just past Paris), go all the way to the back of the mall. Across from Blondie ' sports bar. Which looks pretty cool as well. They also have a $2.99 breakfast special, but I'm a sucker for Mexican! But I'm sure I'll be checking that place out later in the day. Stop in and enjoy some cheap, delicious, Vegas breakfast!
