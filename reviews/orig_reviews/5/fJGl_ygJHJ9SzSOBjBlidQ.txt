This is it!  Our family has been dining here for 51 years!  Bringing 4 generations to dine together and it is the go to place when family comes home for a visit!  EVERYTHING on the menu is top notch!  Our top faves are the Cheese Crisp, Sour Cream Beef Enchalada and Fajitas which is enough for two. Family owned and operated, and truly a hometown eatery.  Service is great, fast and the quality is perfect everytime-for the 51 years we've been dining here- we have never had a bad meal. The prices are great and quanities are good, and the quality is beyond compare. You will be back- again and again.
