Delicious and on point with flavor. I have eaten here enough times to say that the food is fantastic. Quality ingredients where you can taste the freshness. I have yet to have had a bad meal, drink or service at this establishment. Also, you can dine indoors or outdoors at Segundo Sol's patio with a nice decor & great ambiance in the heart of the Vegas strip!
