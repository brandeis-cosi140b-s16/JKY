I love TeePee. The atomosphere in the restaurant is authentic and fun, and the food is killer. I love the chicken enchiladas with rice and beans...so delicious! Service is always good, chips and salsa brought out are a major plus, and I always leave full and happy! Definitely would reccomend to anyone.
