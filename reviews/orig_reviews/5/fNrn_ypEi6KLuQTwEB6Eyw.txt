I consider myself a taco aficionado.  I know a lot of restaurants have their style of preparing tacos, and a lot of them are excellent (even the typical fried or greasy goodness that represents well, but is not the best for the body). 

Enter Taco Guild.   Was this building a former Catholic church? Very cool decor, chic/modern with touches of the inquisition.  I like the portions (small) for several reasons.  You can order as many as you want, but 2 will probably suffice.  I had the AL PASTOR PORK grilled pineapple, jalape√±o bacon, pickled red onion. 3.95 and the URBAN BEAN COFFEE BRAISED BEEF caramelized onion, mango jicama relish, Cotija cheese. 3.95. Priced reasonably and very delicious.
