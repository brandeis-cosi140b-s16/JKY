I think this is around the same price as Tacos El Gordo. I also think it tastes the same but Taco Y Taco might be a little spicier. I'm not a big fan of spicy foods but I can still tolerate the spice level. 
We went here before heading to the movies on a Friday night, and there was hardly a line which is great because if we went to tacos el gordo, there would've been at least a 30 minute wait in line! We went went for a second round.
