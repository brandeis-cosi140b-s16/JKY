First of all, I am totally not understanding these 3 star reviews. Sol is awesome!!! The salsa and bean dip are complimentary and awesome with their chips. The pineapple goat cheese guac is amazing!!! I ordered the pork carnitas burrito with black beans and rice. I ate 6 hours ago and I'm still stuffed!!! My friend got chicken and shrimp quesadillas. She loved them as well. Everything is fresh, cooked well and garnished beautifully. This place finally quenched my TexMex craving in Scottsdale!! A++++++
