This is my all time favorite spot to eat at! We're regulars here at Mercado's. We use to go to the one on spring mtn before they closed & moved to this location, which I think is much more better! The service is great, food is amazing & drinks are supreme. I always get the margaritas or daiquiris. They give big portions for a reasonable price. Serve chips w/ salsa & bean dip at the table & at the end give you a kind of like a cinnamon pita chip type of dessert on the house. I highly recommend this place !
