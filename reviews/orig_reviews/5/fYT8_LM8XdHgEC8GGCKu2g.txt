I love this place, let me tell you why. 

Reasonably priced.
Unpretentious.
Clean--though it doubles as a gaming bar. 
Great drinks -- La Patrona. 
Great drinks -- being redundant -- tequila selection. 
Open 24/7*. 
Great food and great consistency*. 
-nothing pisses me off more than having a great meal; then returning and getting a sub-par meal. 
Live bands-call ahead in case you want music/quietness. 
Great locale. 
Never messed up an order. 
Fast and efficient=great staff. 

Things my hubby and I recommend there:
Enchiladas-any kind
Guacamole
Mango shrimp guacamole
Ground beef-tacos or whatever
Chips, salsa, bean dip
Tomato soup
Chimichangas

*They do close for MAJOR holidays
*They do not serve all entrees after 11pm (ex. no ground beef entrees)
