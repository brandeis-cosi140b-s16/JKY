My favorite spot for Taco Tuesday/Tequila Tuesday. The margaritas are dankalicious. The tacos don't rock my world, but are reasonably priced. Love the quesadillas, love the outdoor seating. Service is hit or miss, more toward the miss, but I've come to accept and embrace this because overall, Dos Gringos is so fun. PS No bunnies allowed
