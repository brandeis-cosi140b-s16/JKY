A local realtor recommended Spotted Donkey as a great place to dine and have a drink on the patio.  We could not have been happier with our experience there!  The outdoor patio had gorgeous views of the surrounding mountains, the food was delicious and innovative, and the staff was friendly and enthusiastic.   This place is a new Phoenix area favorite!
