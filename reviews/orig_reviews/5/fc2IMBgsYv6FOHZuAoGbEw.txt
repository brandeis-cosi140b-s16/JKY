Nice ambience. It was packed, Cinco de Mayo. But the Hostess found us a table for 2. Great Mahi Baja Tacos.
John our waiter was so real, gave us great recommendations on what to get. Also great timing for everything. We heard an owl on the way to our car, then spotted it on tall tower in the dark before it flew off.
