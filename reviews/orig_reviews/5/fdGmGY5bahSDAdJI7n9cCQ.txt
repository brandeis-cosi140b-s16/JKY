I'm typically not fund of Mexican food from restaurants, as my parents are AMAZING cooks at home. I came here with my husband and ordered a carne asada plate. He ordered a torts. We really enjoyed the food. The caramelized onions with the asada were delicious along with the corn tortillas. I also thought the chips sprinkled with cheese and beans that  they brought to us before our meals was flavorful and left me wanting more. I can't wait to different food on their menu.
