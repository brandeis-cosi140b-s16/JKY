Definite five. We're visiting PHX and trying to make as many taco stops as we can. This was a total yelp find, and we ordered based on tips. 

The horchata was exceptional--light and fruity. The best horchata I've had. Five just for that. 

Five for all three tacos we tried: Oaxacan Black Mole, Santa Condesa Mahi Mahi, and Mayan Cochinita Pibil. So good. 

And five for a varied and delicious salsa bar, great neighborhood feel, and helpful waitstaff. 

If I lived closer if be a regular!
