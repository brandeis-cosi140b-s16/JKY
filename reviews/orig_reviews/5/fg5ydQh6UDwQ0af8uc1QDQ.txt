In Champaign-Urbana on business and stopped in here after reading the glowing Yelp reviews. It's everything you'd want from a Mexican place, provided you're not looking for a full service sit-down restaurant. My chorizo burrito was excellent (the tortilla alone was incredible!) and I also tried the fried mushroom quesadilla, which was positively dreamy. It's greasy street food, but that's exactly what you want sometimes, and the flavors are authentic. As for service, it's speedy and accommodating -- the place was packed when I realized I'd forgotten to ask for my receipt. I'd placed my order a half hour earlier, yet the employee cheerfully created a new receipt for me... accurately, from memory no less, in the midst of a huge back-up at the counter. From now on, I'll never miss an opportunity to eat here whenever I come to the area. What a gem!
