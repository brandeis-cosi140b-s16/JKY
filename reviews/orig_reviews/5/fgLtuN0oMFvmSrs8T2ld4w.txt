I just had a great first experience at Border Grill in the Forum Shops. I was seated promptly at 6:30 PM on a Saturday Night. Then I got to enjoy lightly salted fresh chips with 3 types of fresh salsa (green, smoky red, and a slightly spicy red). I ordered the grilled fish tacos. They're served on fresh white corn tortillas with a jicama slaw, grapefruit, and avocado and are topped with a chimole sauce. The tortillas were soft, the fish was charred perfectly, and the play between the crunch of the slaw, sweetness of the grapefruit and creaminess of the avocado worked so well. Finally, the chimole sauce (made from roasted peppers) was salty, smoky, and sweet at the same time. I'm short, this meal was the culinary highlight of my vacation.
