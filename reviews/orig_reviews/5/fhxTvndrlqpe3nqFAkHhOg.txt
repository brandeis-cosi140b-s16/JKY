The food and the service here are amazing. I got the Bandit Plate and my friend got tamales. The flavors were perfectly balanced and incredible. We got the brownie with dulce de leche ice cream and is one of the best desserts I have ever had.  The chips were fresh and the salsa has just the right amount of heat. 

Trevor is an terrific server - attentive and friendly without being overbearing. Everyone from the hostess to the bussers were all very polite and helpful. I would go back in a heartbeat - if the rest of the food is as good as what we had, you would never go wrong.
