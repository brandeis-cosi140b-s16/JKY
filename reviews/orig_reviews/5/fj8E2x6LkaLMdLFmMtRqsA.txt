This is a great place for me to get a Hawaiian taste without having it be your standard dish. The taco fusion aspect is really unique. The staff here is really nice and friendly every time I have been in.
My favorite is the kaluah pork tacos. Gotta get them with the sweet onion salsa and habanero for some kick.
The bark is really awesome too! Will be back again soon!
