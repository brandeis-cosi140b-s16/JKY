Our company held a business meeting here just yesterday and although I had never eaten here previously I had seen good things and heard good things about it so we were hopeful and loved it!
We had our meeting in their private room, which is very nice- it's a little loud while they're prepping, etc...however we'd definitely come back with a microphone or just as a business lunch. The patio also looks like a great location for a nice business lunch.
Don, the GM, is GREAT!!! He was very detail oriented, conscious of our needs, the servers were awesome and everyone loved the food. We had another vendor bring a machine into the restaurant and Don was very accommodating with this as well. 
I would give it 4.5 stars if I could - simply because of the noise during our business meeting portion, other than that - it was great. 
We sincerely appreciate the great food and service and plan to be back!
