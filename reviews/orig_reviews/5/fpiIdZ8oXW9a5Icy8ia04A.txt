$1.75 margaritas all day every day.  That's the hook. That's what drew us in (along with some really good yelp reviews).  The food! That's what keeps us coming back! We drove by this place a million times and always said "someday". That day finally came. And now we crave it all the time!

Punctual servers, friendly staff, the endless supply of chips and delicious house made salsa that flow like water... That's just the start!

My wife loves Carne Asada, and in my opinion, Mi Patio's is better than all the joints that claim "Phoenix's best"! Not to mention the burro is the size of a small pillow and served with your choice of rice or beans!

I got the Red Chile beef burro on our last visit, and was feelin kind of wild so I upgraded to "enchilada" style... I wish that I hadn't bc the red chile sauce was incredible just on its own!! 

The best part is: I want to try something different every time I go here to eat! EVERYTHING looks amazing and Mi Patio hasn't let me down yet!
