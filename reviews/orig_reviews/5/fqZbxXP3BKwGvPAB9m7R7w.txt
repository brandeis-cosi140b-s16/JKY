Been coming here since it opened, has had a few bumps in the road getting going, but the apple smoked meats and the fresh hot salsa keeps me coming back 2 times a week. i love the Angus Burger with guacamole and bacon! the Barbacoa is also yummy. they are getting organized and things are starting to pick up. definitely one of my top lunch spots in north phx.
