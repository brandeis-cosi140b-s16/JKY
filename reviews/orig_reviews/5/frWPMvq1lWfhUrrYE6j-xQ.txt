There are only 620 reviews, so I guess this gem needs another one...

I am based in S. California, but come to Phoenix for business several times per quarter. I typically dine alone, so I really do not care about atmosphere or even service. I really want good and unique food. But, Gallo Blanco gives you all three and they do so consistently. 

The Agua Fresca that I had (Cantaloupe) tonight was really good and went well with the 5 tacos I ordered. While I tend to stick to the tacos (they are really good), everything coming out of the kitchen looks great.

Gallo Blanco is the best Latin (New) place in North America!
