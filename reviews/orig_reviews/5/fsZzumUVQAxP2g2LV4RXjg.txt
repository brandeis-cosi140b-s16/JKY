I've been in twice now, and have been pleased each time. Dishes made with real, scorching-hot New Mexico chilies for the daring, and Spanish-style tapas for those who prefer tamer fare. Come to think of it, they may be the only folks in town who combine the cuisines of Spain and New Mexico, and I like the result. Pretty much any carne adovada dish is worth a try. Finally, as a margarita connoisseur who's been known to send back a lame marg (especially those made with off-the-shelf premix), I can definitely rate the Enchanted margarita as top-notch!
