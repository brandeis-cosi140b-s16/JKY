Love the fish tacos here!! Also the carne asada as well as the Street corn! Yum! 
I'm a super big fan of street tacos, and some good chips and salsa for starters, and this place has it all!! Must try if you haven't already!! 
The only thing missing would be for them to have Horchata and Jamaica water!!! That would put them in my all time favorite after Gallo failed!! :) Enjoy!!!
