I had lunch here with my wife and two year old twins. We arrived at 11:00am on Saturday right after the restaurant opened. The food was excellent. I had a breakfast burrito and my wife had chicken tamales. The chips were great and came with three different salsas. 

The service was also excellent, however there were only about five other customers since we were there so early. 

If this was located closer to my house I would be here all the time. I will have to settle for stopping by whenever I am lured to the northwest part of town
