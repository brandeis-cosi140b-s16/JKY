We only had tequila and beer, so I can't comment on the food. I am really just writing a review on our bartender Leah.  We went here two nights in a row after seeing a concert at the Brooklyn Bowl.  Leah was AMAZING!  She has to be one of the hardest working bartenders I have ever seen.  She made our experience quite enjoyable.
