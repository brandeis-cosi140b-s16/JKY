Since I moved to Vegas, almost 3 years ago, I've been on the search of really good Mexican Restaurant.
I've found a couple of good ones, including taco shops, but I still was searching for one like back home, San Diego,  CA.
Today a co-worker texted me asking if I had plans for dinner.  When I didn't she suggested we get together and try out Juan's.  It had been highly recommended by a neighbor of her whose boyfriend is a chef.  So she figured, must be good!
And it was really good.  
I had the carne asada taco plate and the meat was cooked perfectly.   Just like back home at my one of my favorite restaurants.  While the tortillas were not made on site, they tasted close to it.
The beans and rice were just like I like them.
My friend had the fajitas and said they were also really good.
Before you order, they bring the chips out with both salsa and beans.  I had never seen beans brought before with the chips, but it worked out really good.
The service was perfect from the staff.
No question, I will be back again and again!
