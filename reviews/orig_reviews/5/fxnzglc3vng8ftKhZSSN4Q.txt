Went here last night for another KoMex fix and ordered the bulgogi (beef) and pulled pork sliders.  Holy cow, the sliders were fabulous!  The bulgogi was also wonderful and when paired with some kimchi = :) to the nth power.  

Go.  And leave a big ol' tip because even with a big ol' tip, you'll still marvel at the ridiculously cheap cheque.  Last night's dinner: free chips and guac/salsa, free bottled water, bulgogi beef plate, 3 pulled pork sliders, a side of (free) kimchi, free orange slices and fortune cookies = $12.95.  Sick.  We gave them a 50% tip and it STILL came well under $20.
