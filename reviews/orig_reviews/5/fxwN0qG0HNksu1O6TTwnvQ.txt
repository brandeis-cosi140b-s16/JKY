Fast service, good service & great food.  95% of items under $10.  I had the Norte√±a torta with steak & a papaya cremosa & both were bomb.  I think I'll try the Del Rey next time & the mango cremosa.  My girlfriend had like a chicken torta & that was very good as well.  She got a strawberry/banana cremosa which I did like better than my papaya one.  All in all I'll be back next time I'm in Phoenix.
