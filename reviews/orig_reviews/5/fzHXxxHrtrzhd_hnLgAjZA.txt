El Lindo is one of our favorite spots in Las Vegas (Henderson, I know).

Spectacular views of the city, great bean dip and chips, amazing service (these guys work hard for the money), fun atmosphere and of course, really delicious entrees.

If you go on the weekend they'll have a single musician jamming out hard on guitar or some keys and singing/playing along with some pre-recorded tracks. These guys are INTO it, so just sit back and enjoy them enjoying themselves.

Food-wise, I've had a lot of different items and they have all been good. Probably not the absolute greatest food I've ever had, but it's quite tasty and the prices are very reasonable.

As a whole package, this is one of our go-to spots and we always bring our out of towners here and they rave about it. Being on top of seemingly the largest hill in Henderson makes it a cool experience, so try to get a window seat and make sure to hang over the railing for a bit before you head off for the evening.
