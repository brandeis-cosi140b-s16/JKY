So, so, sooo goooood. I have never had a bad meal here. I've lived in Austin for 5 years now, but every time I come home for Christmas, I have to eat here at least once. My favorite is a shrimp and scallop lemon cream sauce dish. The merlot braised short ribs are also pretty awesome. Their white sangria is pretty tasty but maybe even a bit too sweet for my tastes. 

This place is a bit more expensive than your standard restaurant in Champaign, but it is definitely worth it, if only for a treat every now and then. This place has excellent food and the amount is usually more than I can eat in one meal anyway. 

I love the way the inside is decorated - it feels very festive without being too obtrusive.

Also, Escobars is just fun to say.
