Everything about this place was amazing!

Food selection and quality, service, bustling vibe, etc. Experience here will be something you never expected from a Mexican restaurant.

Tacos de Camarones (deep fried shrimp tacos) was super tasty.

Parking lot is huge, but it's always packed. You'll see why, on your first visit.
