This place tops chipotle HANDS DOWN. If your in and you like sauces- there are a ton to choose from. Also- get their special sauce. I think it's a chipotle ranch. They charge 50 cents for a small side and a dollar for a large but trust me, it's worth it! The service has always been good- but let's be honest- this place is all about that GOOD FOOD.
