Went here with a coworker for lunch. Venue and decor was very nice for a Mexican food place. Chips with salsa and refried beans for dipping as a free appetizer. He ordered a chicken enchilada. I ordered a burrito and enchilada combo platter. Food was amazing. Prices were above "average". Service was top notch. Our drinks were never empty. Plates were cleared promptly. Definitely going to this place again!
