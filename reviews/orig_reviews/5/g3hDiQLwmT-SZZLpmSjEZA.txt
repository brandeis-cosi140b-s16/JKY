The search is over....I've Found My Taco place. I ordered a chicken taco, carne asada, and a fish taco with a delectable cheese quesadilla. The fish taco blew me away! After one bite I knew I had to have another fish taco. OMG! Thank you for this spot. Oh, i'll go back again and again. Nope, not a fancy restaurant, but so what....who cares?
