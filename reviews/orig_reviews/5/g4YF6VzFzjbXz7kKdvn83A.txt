Fabulous food and exceptional service from a server named Nick. My wife loved the chicken enchiladas with calabacitas and rice and I had the chicken chimichanga with rice and pinto beans. The salsa music set the tone for the awesome food that we enjoyed. We were pleasantly surprised with the tasty pitcher of Margaritas that was suggested buy our server. If you want to support a family business in Gilbert while being provided with a memorable evening with great food, LA Ristra must be on the list.
