OK, so hubby and I have been here at least 5 times and we've loved it every time. My favorite thing here? ELOTE!!! Corn on the cob. This is not your average corn. It's grilled - it's covered in Mexican cheese, probably some mayo, butter and spices. It's amazing, and totally worth the $5 it costs. I'm not kidding. I even ran home this last week and made hubby try to replicate the recipe on the grill. Oh, and the salad - Ensalada Cortada is really, really good. The tacos are fun and come out individually. Anyway, I would recommend this place to anyone wanting a unique food experience and interesting decor (apparently the men's urinal is something to talk about!).
