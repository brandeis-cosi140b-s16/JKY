Grand Opening week of a New Mexican Tequila Bar and restaurant!  La Ristra has menu laden with Hatch green chilis, sopapillas, and tapas.  

I started with Papa's Bravas which remind me of a Tapas I'd had in Madrid, and perfect for my 5 year too since, he is sensitive to spicy food.  

The menu has both a Quesadilla and Cheese Crisp.  I had to ask since, to me they were synonyms.  They recommended the Cheese Crisp for kids because it is simpler.      

For me I ordered the Red and Green Chili plate which was a large portion of the Hatch Green Chilis and another red chili which simmers all day with chucks of adovada pork which is flavorful and tender.  My belly is still warm from chilis while I write this review.  It was great portion of meat.  I normally do not finish my food at a mexican food restaurants due to large portions, but this time I couldn't stop eating.  It was delicious.  

Be careful with the 3 salsas that come with the complimentary chips.  Two of the salsas are quite spicy.  

The owners were friendly.  They came around and asking how everything was.  They mentioned they are going to have live music on the weekends.  I am excited to see what they bring in....
