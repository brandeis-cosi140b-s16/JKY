This is a "New Mexico" style joint.  

Pork is so unique don't waste time on carne Assada or pollo.

So good!  Pork enchiladas or tamales Christmas style (green & red sauce).  Sopapilla is great but you have to eat it fresh so desert before dinner if you take yours with honey.... Unless you get the sopapilla filled with meat.  Either way you win!

-orders take long to get, call it in.
-dine in is "charming", & by that I mean small.
-prices are good.

This is in my top 5 Mexican joints in Vegas.
