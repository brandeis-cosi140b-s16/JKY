I cannot love this place anymore than I already do. Upon entering the building you will fall in love. Both the inside dining area and both patios are gorgeous. The Mission has a wonderful atmosphere.

Before I say anything else, I must say that the table side guac is the best thing I have ever eaten. If you go to The Mission, you MUST get this. Also, I have never had service this fast and prompt. Upon being seated, we were immediately given water and asked our drink orders. Within minutes we received our drinks and appetizers were on their way. In addition, the staff was overly friendly and made you feel right at home.  

Everything here was delicious and amazing, from the food to the drinks. Give The Mission a try, you won't be disappointed.
