Best authentic Mexican food in the East Valley. I'm set in my ways and get the carne asada burrito every time (been going here 6 years), and it has never disappointed. They don't pack your burro full of potatoes or beans, but instead you'll get tons of good beef with the perfect balance of onion and beans. Love the beans. Oh, and regardless the item on the menu, you'll leave VERY full for under $7 bucks.
