I had heard about this place years ago, and finally found out what I've been missing out on! Oh my delicious, we loved this place. The chips and salsa were a great start. All very flavorful and fresh, that's always a good start. We all ordered a dish that included the Adovado...amazing! Lots of other things on the menu to try, we will definitely be going back.
