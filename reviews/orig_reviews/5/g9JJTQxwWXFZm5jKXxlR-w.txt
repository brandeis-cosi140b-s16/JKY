In a word, albeit a made up word: hype-worthy

I had a shrimp burrito, and fish, al pastor, carne asada, cabeza (Beef cheek.  Don't be a pussy, try it.  Just open your mouth bitch!), tacos.

On top of that, the guy behind the register was so friendly.  Last time I was called sir that many times it was a crackhead asking for change.
