Seriously the best tacos in town and the kicker - they're only $2 apiece!!  Don't expect any fancy restaurant you'll only find a taco stand outside of the Mexican grocery store with no place to sit but you will find the most delicious tacos and a condiment bar where you can hook your taco up with anything you want.  Where else can you get a ribeye taco for $2??  I go every week - so worth it.  I've tried most of them but my favorites are the ribeye and the roasted pork....you can't go wrong with any of them though!
