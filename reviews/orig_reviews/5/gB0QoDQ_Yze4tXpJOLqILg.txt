I love it here. End of story. 

I was hooked on their chicken quesadilla's when they first opened about a year ago. I probably ate there once or twice a week. 
I've always been a fan of local eats but with the surrounding corporate mexican options in the neighborhood, it can get easily overlooked. 

Now that I'm older and wiser I've explored the rest of their menu, I can still say this is my favorite mexican joint in the area. There potato tacos are unique and to absolutely tasty. They say they're known for their fish taco, but in my opinion, their potato taco has NOTHING on their fish taco. 
They have taco Tuesdays which makes the tacos affordable for the typical college student, AND they have happy hour on their beer. 

Now really, let's think this through here, a local mexican place for dollar tacos and happy hour on beer?! HOW IS A COLLEGE STUDENT TO TURN THIS DEAL DOWN?! Exactly. 

The owner's a laugh and super laid back. I love all the fun signs they use for decoration, it adds to the local feel with tons of character. 

Next time you're at UNLV between classes, you have to check this place out.
