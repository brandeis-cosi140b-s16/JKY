I want to give a shout out to the bartender Joe. We picked up The Booze issue Las Vegas and read about the specialty drinks available. We truly enjoyed the Smokey Pablo he made. He also shared some insights of things to enjoy while we were visiting. The entire staff was great giving us a hand out on how to make their drinks at home and information on the artist/artwork they had. Thanks for the great memories!!!
