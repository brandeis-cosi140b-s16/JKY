Wow SCORE!!!!!!!
i stopped in here last night while heading to fat  cats
and tell you what im glad i got in when i did .. no waiting was seated right away
by the time i left there was a huge crowd waiting to be seated..... i tried the caramello quesadilla and it was awesome the steak was tender and very flavorful
my date had a soft taco and bean and cheese burro and raved about them
very attentive and friendly wait staff and very affordable with a great atmosphere
i will be returning regularly
