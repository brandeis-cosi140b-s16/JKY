Hot dayummm!  Their salsa bar alone is enough to keep me coming back.  All four of their salsas are so good I could strap a bib on and chug em faster than a horchata.  Especially the chipotle & the green salsas!  The tacos are $2/each and come with a mountain of meat filling.  Carne asada, and al pastor tacos are where it's at.  Carnitas was good too.  I was most impressed by the fact that the food was swimming in grease like most Mexican fare.  We tried the cilantro fries, but they were a bit underwhelming with a small amount of carne asada, cheese, and cilantro with small sides of sour cream & guac.
