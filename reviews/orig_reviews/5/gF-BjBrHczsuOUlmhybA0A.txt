If you love your hand rolls, you will love Jaburrito! For the price, you get a large hand roll that will quickly fill you up. They also offer combo options with seaweed salad and miso soup.

The interior is nice and bright with lots of sunshine. The dining area is not very large and will most likely be full around lunch time. If you've been to chipotle or cafe rio, you will find that the ordering is similar. You can either get a pre-made burrito with your choice of wrap (seaweed, soy paper, wheat/flour tortilla, etc.) or make a totally custom burrito. My first order was the Rockport, which includes soft shell crab, spicy tuna, imitation crab, and other good stuff. It was somewhat spicy with the included jalape√±os, but you are more than welcome to substitute anything for anything. My favorite part is the tempura crunch!

They assemble your burrito fairly quickly. They have a fancy machine that builds the perfect layer of rice on which they will lay a sheet of seaweed. At the end of the assembly line is another fancy machine that will wrap your burrito.

I rate it 5 stars because it is just so delicious and fairly quick to order. It's also easy on your wallet, considering you're essentially paying for a sushi roll. Average price for a burrito is $10. Add a couple of bucks and you get a sweet combo deal!
