The food at Rancho de Tia Rosas is phenomenal, the flavors in their meat (beef, chicken and pork) have remarkable depth. It is hard to name a favorite entree since every menu item I have tried is so good but to name a few, the enchiladas with green sauce (out of this world!), shrimp tacos, and carne asada plate are all a must try. And you must stop in for Happy Hour if you can, excellent specials! The restaurant is not only decorated to perfection but also very clean and tidy.  Always great service, and servers are knowledgable in gluten free menu items.  I would thoroughly recommend Rancho De Tia Rosa to anyone who likes mexican food and a great atmosphere!
