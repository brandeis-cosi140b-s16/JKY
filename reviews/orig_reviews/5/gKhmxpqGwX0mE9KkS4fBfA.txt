best kept secret in Phoenix and we love it that way, it can get crowded on Friday nights and Saturdays
Anyone I have sent there becomes a fan instantly
Family owned and run, you go there a few times, they know exactly who you are and what you eat.
Love, Love, Love this gem, have lived in Phoenix all my life and know that there aren't too many AUTHENTIC mexican food places like this around!
