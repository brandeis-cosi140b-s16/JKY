I have been going here since I was in high school....and I love this place! You can't beat their breakfast burritos. They are like $3, they are HUGE, they taste amazing (tortilla, eggs, cheese, meat...how could you go wrong?), and you can get them any time of day (my favorite part). I always stop by this place when I'm in the area.
