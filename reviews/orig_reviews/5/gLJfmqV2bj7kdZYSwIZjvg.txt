There are 2 towns East of Phoenix called Globe and Superior. This area has awesome Mexican food. And a local family moved their business to Tempe. This restaurant is very casual, and a bit of a hole in the wall... it is located in a strip mall. Don't be fooled, it has delicious food! I highly suggest the goyo burro (I think that is the way it is spelled??).
