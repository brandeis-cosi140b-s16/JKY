At the behest of a few friends and some glowing Yelp reviews, I decided to venture to Chino. 

The one on Dobson and Chandler is practically invisible unless you know where to look, but once I found it I thought it was kinda cool that it was hidden away like some manner of Indiana Jones treasure (there's a timely reference for you).

The people inside are BEYOND friendly.  Like, super friendly.  Like, if they weren't serving my food and helping me understand the complexities of their menu, they might have freaked me out, sorta like It the Clown or that one episode of Are You Afraid of the Dark or Michael Jackson's nose (or lack thereof).   They really do give you a crash course on how to order, and give you samples of everything.

I got the machaca beef and the emerald chicken, with jerk rice and refried beans.  Dear lord.  Talk about scrumtrilescent.  The machaca was so flavorful and delicious, and the emerald chicken was just the most amazing thing I've ever put in a tortilla (beside the one time me and this girl were messing around using food, and I...nevermind).

The only thing that could possibly make this place any better is a bigger selection of drinks.  Some Mexican drinks (Horchata, maybe) fresh made or some juices and teas might make it complete.  So good.  So so good.
