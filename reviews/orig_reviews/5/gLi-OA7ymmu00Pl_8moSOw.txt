LOVE this place! I'm addicted. I could come here everyday. Everything on the menu is pretty cheap and super affordable. Every time I come, there is a huge line out the door, so be prepared to wait. It is definitely well worth the wait! The place is small too, so be ready to fight someone for a seat. 

Here's what I've had:
-fish tacos (small but good)
-tortas (I've tried carne asada, chorizo, and milanesa)
-queso fundido with carne asada (melted cheese - really greasy)

Their tortas are the best! They are only around $5 and it's a pretty large portion. Also, each meal comes with free chips and salsa!!
