If there was a tinder for food then Carlitos would be one of the places I would swipe right for. The bio would read something like this: big, giant portions. Green chile sauce all over everything. Burritos so big, you'll need two hands. What connoisseur of Mexican food would not be intrigued? I would message them with something to the effect of, Hi I'm a big fan of sopapillas, but I have a hard time finding them in Las Vegas, I especially love good service and margaritas. They would then respond: yes, we have sopapillas. You can get them with chicken or carne and red or green chile. And if you don't know there are also dessert sopapillas which are quite delicious. If none of the above entices you, then you can always stick to the basics: tacos and beer. There's domestic and imported cervezas. And on the taco front, there's a previously unheard of Navajo taco. 
If you swipe right on this place, and decide that the aforementioned food sounds delicious then the cashier will pronounce you as a union and you can shortly expect a happy food baby in the immediate future
