The best Mexican food we've found in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area since we moved here a few years ago.  Tried it initially based on a recommendation, and now El Encanto is where we take all of our out-of-town guests for a great meal paired with great ambiance.

My personal favorite is the pollo fundito.  Great flavor, great portion size.  I also really like the salsas that come out with the chips before the meal.  The first time I was there I wound up taking a container home.  We're always sure to get deep-fried ice-cream as a desert, too.  

The pond in the center of the property is beautiful (except for the one instance we saw where a bunch of large geese all ganged up and attacked a small helpless duck...the wait staff did their best to save it).  Also, don't allow yourself to get seated in the back room of the restaurant.  No view of the pond, and a large loud clunky heater or a/c unit kills the ambiance.  

We'll be back many more times I'm sure...
