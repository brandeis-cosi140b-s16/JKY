Great service and food. I'm a NYker that moved to the Valley of the Sun less than a year ago and finding good food here is hard. I live in North Phx and everything here is chain restaurants or food badly made. I went in with low expectations but was pleasantly surprise by their staff, food choices, prices and great service. I have visited this place three times already and am planning to become a regular.
