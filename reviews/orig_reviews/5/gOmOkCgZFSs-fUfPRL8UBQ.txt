If you've been to Chipotle, you know what the food is like. This is more a comment on both how fresh they seem to keep their food and the people who work there. 

BOTH ARE AMAZING.

Their fajita veggies always have the perfect amount of that delicious charred flavor (no barely cooked onions here - they're actually grilled like they should be). 

More importantly, the people who work here are actually friendly and good at their jobs. I've never had a messed up order or encountered anyone who wasn't like, the best ever at customer service. I've seen more than a few rude customers here though, and I'm always amazed at how nice the people behind the counter are. Seriously. Best Chipotle I've found in Vegas.
