Excellent food, I love their $2 taco special happy hour!!!!!!!!!! And their fish tacos are awesome, but I get the spicy stuff on the side, it's a little pungent. The chips and dip are oddly addicting, and worth going in themselves. It's a place to go with a good friend, it's not very large, but it's very colorful inside, and the waiters are nice.
