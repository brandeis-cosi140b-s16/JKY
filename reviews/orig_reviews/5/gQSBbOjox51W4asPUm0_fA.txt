My hubby and I and our friend, Juan, love this place! The chile rellenos are my favorite. The chile is tender and loaded with cheese and great sauce on top. My hubby and friend have a new favorite in the Cubano Torta. Also have enjoyed the cheap tacos, enchiladas and burritos. Soooo happy to find a true mom and pop Mexican food place that is authentic.
