A great place to start a Vegas vacation and stay on budget. I found myself coming here  several times during my stay in Las Vegas. The $2 tacos are excellent and nothing like taco bell, they have a nice fresh shredded beef and very fresh tasting. ingredients. Also the $2 margaritas were good welcomed addition to the budget meal. The only downside was the service was rather slow but the good food, drinks and prices made it worth the wait. I will definitely return!
