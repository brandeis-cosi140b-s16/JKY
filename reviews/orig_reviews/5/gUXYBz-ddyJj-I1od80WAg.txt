Man, oh man, did I have an amazing experience here.  My pal Lynn and I arrived in Vegas hungry but were not ready to splurge on the strip.  A quick Yelp search led us to paradise: Island tacos!  Absolutely amazing service and tacos loaded to the brim with veggies, guac, and pineapple salsa, all for an extremely reasonable price.

Do yourself a favor: ditch chipotle and the strip, just come get a few tacos from Braddah's!
