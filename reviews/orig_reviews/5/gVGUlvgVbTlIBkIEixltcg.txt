We recently moved to the mountains and this is the closest restaurant to our house. GOOD THING! Because it's the new favorite restaurant of ours! We've been greeted by the staff every time we go in; The service was exceptional - We ordered the Pollo Fundido and the Steak Fajitas, which were both amazing! The server never let our iced tea get past half empty; The Manager - on most occasions - is moving between the bar tables & restaurant tables making sure everyone is happy. Speaking of Happy...Happy hour here is GREAT - even though we don't drink! The specials are good - and the atmosphere is FUN. If you have room - try the dessert - chocolate chimi's = OMG it was home made ice cream - this day it was a fresh French vanilla - with mini-chocolate filled chimis! Delicious! This is our new "Cheers" - like seeing friends every time!
