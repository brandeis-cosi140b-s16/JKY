Excellent.  So much to say...we were in the area for three days and found ourselves at Cien Agaves twice, wishing for more.  Loved the Prickly Pear Margarita and the shrimp tacos and carne asada tacos the first day.  Went back for Happy Hour today. Usually happy hour drinks are pretty weak, but they kept high standards and served a delicious house margarita. And the guacamole with pomegranate seeds...yum. 
Thank you Leon and Jeff for the great service.
