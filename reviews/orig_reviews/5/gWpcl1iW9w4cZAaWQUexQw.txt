Man this place is something else.

The food is tasty, the place is a totally wonderful dive, and the staff are fantastic.  I just wish the protein portions were larger and the rice and beans a little smaller.  They're all fantastic.  I got the Jade Chicken and Machaca in a quesadilla with black beans and jerk fried rice.  I think next time I'll try the emerald chicken in a quesdilla.
