I have been celebrating with fajitas since I was a little girl!! From second grad to now... 20 years later...I'm still celebrating this delicious food! I like my shrimp fajitas with the onions extra cartelized (adds so much flavor) but don't forget to try the infamous queso dip!!! It has scallions on top but they can leave them out if you would like!! Enjoy this pre meal with their fresh chips or ask for for and flour tortillas to enjoy it with!!! You won't be sorry!!!
