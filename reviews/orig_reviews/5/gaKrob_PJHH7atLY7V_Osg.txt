The food is super delicious!  It even beats the yumminess I would get when I lived in San Diego.  If pork is your thing, do not miss out on the al pastor fries.  Elote corn is also available and is delicious!

Service is great and prices are even better!  Full service bar stocked with all the fixings for your favorite drinks.  If you live in the Henderson area, check this place out!
