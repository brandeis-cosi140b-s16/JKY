Went to Toros this weekend with a group of friends.  We couldn't wait until this new  Tapas Summerlin Restaurant opened.  From the moment we walked in we were pleased.  The atmosphere was very cool; loved all the reclaimed wood on the walls.  The bar in the center has a really fun & friendly vibe.   Something different for the area!  The hostess was sweet,  told us immediately that they were very busy and it might be a bit.  But it was great!  Our waiter was very nice, explained the menu for us and helped us out with some favorites.  We were all very pleased!  Loved all the specialty drinks, The white wine sangria was so Awesome!  The staff seemed to all be so excited which made our dinner experience all the more fun....I am reading some of the reviews that people have written and I think that these people forget that this restaurant has been open for less than 2 weeks and it takes time to work out all the kinks.  With that being said, and with patience and understanding, this restaurant has unbelievable food, must try the Albondigas (meatballs) and the Pollo Parrilla (half Chicken) and lastly the Flan is perfection!  I love John Cutter's and wish the owner and his staff great success.  We all can't wait to go back soon!
