Visited Santos Lucha Libre today for lunch and was floored by the flavor. They allowed us to try all of their meats and I decided that their Green Chili and Barbacoa are some of the best I've ever eaten. It's not just melt in your mouth deliciousness that gets me, it was the flavor that brought it home. Both were spicy but not hot for the sake of being hot. There was nuances of spices in each bite and it made the meat sing.

I went for the Barbacoa enchiladas. These are not your everyday enchiladas. They melt cotija cheese on the tortillas on the flat top behind the counter, and then place the meat on top of the opened tortillas. Once the cheese has melted they fold the tortillas over and place onto a plate and drizzle enchilada sauce on top from a squeeze bottle. Then they give you the option of topping it off with, lettuce, cilantro, tomatoes, onions, roasted corn, cheese, sour cream and guacamole (for an extra .99). The dish also came with your choice of rice and beans, I opted for the pinto beans and loved their flavor. Who ever came up with these recipes knows their spices!

I ordered a small horchata and then dug in. Only draw back is the cheap plastic wear. The knife barely cut through my cooked tortilla so it was a bit of a struggle, but every bite was worth the work. 

Next visit definitely getting the green chili tacos.
