This is my FAVORITE place to eat in the entire world. Literally. I have never been disappointed with anything, the staff are some of the nicest people I've ever met and they always remember us and our favorite orders. I'm vegan and they ALWAYS remember/know I am going to ask for no dairy on the great vegetarian dishes they offer. You never have to wait long for your food and it tastes like authentic real Mexican/Yucatan food. We make it a point to eat there at least once a week and now that I have moved to LA I miss this restaurant so much! It quite literally is THE BEST Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas. Love ya Frank!
