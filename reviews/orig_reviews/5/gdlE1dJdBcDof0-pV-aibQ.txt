This is probably the Best mexican food in this area. I have been coming here since I was a wee little Tot, and it salsa is amazing. I would recommend this place to everyone even if it is just for the chips salsa and (white death) signature margarita on the rocks. 

It truly is amazing and they have great healthy options as well, such as there calabacitas, seafood, and chicken options.

Even if you don not go for lunch or Dinner, they have a very good cheap breakfast with eggs, bacon, sausage, and more.
