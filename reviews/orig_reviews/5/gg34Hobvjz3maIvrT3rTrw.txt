We started at the Gilbert location when they first opened and loved it. Then we found out that the chandler location opened and since then we frequent this place opening. We have a group of us that are regulars on Wed or Thurs. evening, we will say that the food is plentiful and good (always have leftovers to take home) The chips and salsa is great, and their margarita's are fantastic. 
 I do want to comment on the service, they are all so very nice, we especially like MARK & ZANE....They are fantastic. If you go there stop by and tell them hello and you've made a friend for life, seriously they are so friendly and when you return they will remember you :) Thank you MARK & ZANE..........Tom and I will continue to restaurant  frequent this because of people like you.........See ya next Thursday :)
