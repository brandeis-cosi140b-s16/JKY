** Add another restaurant to the rotation **

Wow! Stopped in last night and was delighted. We decided to just share a bunch of stuff. We had guacamole and chips, steak tacos, pork tacos, bacon torta, goat tacos, roasted turnips, mexican style rice, and roasted beets. The guacamole was fresh and filled with citrus overtones. Very tasty. The roasted beets and turnips were all locally sourced. They were a mix of sweet and tart. Never really had anything like it. Darn good. 

The prices were reasonable and the service was top notch. I would highly recommend a stop at Otro Cafe. I will be returning shortly and bringing some friends.
