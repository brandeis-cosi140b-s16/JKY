I love coming here. The bartenders are amazing and they remember us and what we drink. Gretchen and Matt are our favorite bartenders. We will always come back as long as they are there. Oh and the margaritas...well it's a tequila bar so obviously they are amazing! We enjoy that they stay open late and serve good food. We preferred the old menu but they changed the name so they changed some of the food as well. They also have live music on the weekends and a jukebox if you want to pay for music you love. Overall I would prefer going to this bar late at night and enjoying some yummy drinks!
