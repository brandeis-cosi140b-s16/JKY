Just Amazing!!

I stumbled upon this place a couple months ago, and it has become a regular stop for me! 

To put it simply, you walk into an immaculately clean restaurant, order from some great people who actually act happy to see you, and get mind bogglingly good food!!

BEST fish tacos I've found in Phoenix!

Carne Asada that's out of this world!

Pork and Green Chilis that is absolutely amazing!

Really, the Phoenix Burrito House is just the best on so many levels!
