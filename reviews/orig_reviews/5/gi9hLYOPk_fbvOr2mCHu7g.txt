Everything about this place is wonderful!! I love the huge windows and outdoor patio! Gorgeous! Their food is amazing everything from the chips (there are about 5 different chips in the basket) and salsa to dessert! They have some of the best margaritas in town! Yum! My favorite thing on the menu is the goat cheese stuffed chicken with roaster red pepper sauce! This is to die for!!
