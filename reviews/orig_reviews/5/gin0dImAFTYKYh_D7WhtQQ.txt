Went here again after Jason P, the manager at Sumomaya, reached out and invited us to come give the place another shot. We were not disappointed. The first visit must have been some kind of fluke because both the food and service were absolutely on point here. 

Food:
Ceviche del dia- It had a nice acidity, tasted fresh, and was overall very good.
Maya Roll- spicy tuna and crispy rice. The tuna was fresh and good quality and the crispy rice was well-balanced. It didn't taste like some crispy rice that I have had in the past where it was overly fried.
We also had several nigiri sushi selections and all were fresh, high quality, and delicious.


Drinks:
Thai Basil- Rum, lime, thai basil, and pineapple. Money
Tamarind- Bulleit rye, tamarind, lime and ginger. Also money

Overall, very nice ambiance, food, drinks, and service. Seems like a great place to go for both happy hour and dinner. Huge thanks to Jason for this wonderful dinner.
