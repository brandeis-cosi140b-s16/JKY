This place is fantastic for Sonora style fried fish and shrimp tacos. The toppings bar is awesome for making your tacos the way you want, and the staff is very friendly. My only knock would be the ventilation isn't amazing and it is a smaller space, so it can get a little stuffy and you'll leave with a full belly but clothes that smell like fried fish.
