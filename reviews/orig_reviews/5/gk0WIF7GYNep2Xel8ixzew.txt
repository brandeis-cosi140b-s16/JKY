Let me cut to the chase, get steak tacos! I also like the #18. (Enchilada, tamale and chile relleno) It's unbelievably delicious. Don't ignore this advice! Do the steak tacos! If you go and order some weird obscure thing, it will probably be good, but the signature item is the STEAK TACOS!!!! Don't let the green sauce scare you, it's good. I like the lighter colored sauce as well. The darker sauce is chipotle which is smoked pepper. It is way over powering and anything smoked must be done in moderation. I never do it.
I can not vouch for any other locations.
