In the town of overpriced bland food, this place breaks both molds.  All the reviews for ABODABO are for good reason.  Watch the guy shave it off with a machete as juices drip off the pole-o-meat.  I also got a lengua taco and an asada taco... Both solid a d tasty. The salsas remind me of homemade salsas I've had from old Mexican women... Fresh and full of flavor.  And the tortillas are made right in front of you.  Just go already!
