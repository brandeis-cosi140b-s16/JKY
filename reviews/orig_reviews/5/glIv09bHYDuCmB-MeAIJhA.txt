I've loved Chuy's since I was a tiny tyke in Austin, TX. I loved it every Sunday for lunch after church in high school in Dallas. I loved it again back in Austin as an adult with kids on the patio. I buy their creamy jalapeno (dip/dressing), queso and tortillas whenever I'm making fajitas for a group because they're far superior to the homemade or store-bought. In short... I love this place. 

When we moved here a year ago and I found out they were following shortly thereafter, I may have done a happy dance of joy. And it doesn't disappoint! All the original food, even better service, prices way more reasonable than some other Mexican restaurants in town and a huge patio and wait area.

I also used them for a large to-go order for the first time last weekend and it was a great experience. They didn't try to talk me into an order larger than I planned to purchase (The Big Daddio for 35 people to feed 60+ people... perfect amount), my order was perfectly accurate and well-packaged, hot (which is never something I can assume with a very large to-go order) and they even said if something was wrong they would fix it asap.

Go to Chuy's. Love some good ol' tex mex and yummy margaritas for what they are. Keep this place in business for as long as I live in Charlotte.
