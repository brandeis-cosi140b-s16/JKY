Came here for happy hour and dinner this evening. Nice happy hour with $4 margaritas   and $5 mexican pizzas (recommended). There were just a few other people here this early, so the kitchen staff was super fast. As others have stated, most of the food is spicy hot but the green chili is less hot than the red, and there are items on their menu which  are not hot. Their guacamole is delicious, with a unique garlicky note. If your mouth gets hot from the spices, then order a Sombrero drink ( two shots milk, one shot coffee liqueur) to cool it off. Another option is to order their outstanding sopapillas with honey, which will also sooth your mouth. 
  The chicken chimichanga was a generous size and very good. The green corn tamale was a little small and just average flavor. 
  It is nice to sit out on their colorful patio which feels secluded and has lively music playing. We will certainly return to this delicious restaurant.
