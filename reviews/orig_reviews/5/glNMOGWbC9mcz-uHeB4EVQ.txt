love this place!  I've only been to the bar-side, but bartenders were cool, patrons were great, and the drinks were good, too. oh, and did I mention the tacos? they are delicious!!  They are pretty small but, hey, a taco shouldn't really be all that big.  well-filled and came in corn tortillas (as they should) :) they have a tv, which I only mention because we were interested in watching a game and they happily changed the channel for us. I'll def go back, and it's in a funky fun area with lots of other things around, too!
