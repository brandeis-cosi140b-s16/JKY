This is the kind of Mexican food that I grew up eating at Karichimaka in Tucson. Delicious! My usual order is the red chile chimichanga, which is perfectly done. We also like the crispy cheese crisp with green chiles, and the free chips and salsa are great. 

I have to say that I've eaten at a lot of Mexican restaurants, and La Pi√±ata and Karichimaka are the only ones that do justice to the red chile. Oregon, California, Colorado - all of these places seem to only offer New Mexican fare, which is fine but not truly authentic (to me). 

Their new location will be opening in the next month or so - they don't have an exact date. Come by and write a thank you note on the wall before they close the old location.
