Carne Asada Fries. It's all you need. Now life is complete. Life has purpose and meaning. That purpose is to have more carne asada fries which make life better. 

They have a huge selection of great Mexican food but you need to try the carne asada fries! Tender flavorful meat on top of delicate fries and covered in shredded cheese, magic green sauce and just a drop of sour cream = happiness. And a 1/2 order is only $5 - big enough for 4 people!!

Located just north of the Wynn on the strip and open extremely late it's one of those Vegas secrets that make it an incredible trip. 

Warning - you will want this again. Crave it. Need it.
