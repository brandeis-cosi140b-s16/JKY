SO CHEAP!
SO GOOD!

I'm adding flautas to the list. Yeah, yeah, what you doin' boy eating deep fried tortillas wrapped around meat. Uhhhh, eating deep fried tortillas deliciously wrapped around meat! I probably get them twice a year and promptly remember what I'm eating when they arrive and why I only get them twice a year. But they're delicious. And at TG they're so large I couldn't finish both. The kind waitress was worried that I didn't like them (HA! If she only knew). They're just simply too big to down in one sitting. Especially if you start with a sope. 
Guilty.
