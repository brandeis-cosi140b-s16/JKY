So the server asks "how is everything?"

Brief pause, then I chuckle. 

Trying to hold back my elation, I respond with simply "this is Rancho de Tia Rosa, isn't it?"

He stares back in confusion and says "yes?"

I reply "exactly...."

I then donned my sun blocking spectacles and headed towards the door. I exited the building letting out one last guttural  mariachi cry of satisfaction....AHHHAHAHAHYEEEE! 

I then made my way to the parking lot where I rode off in my trusty Bavarian steed yelling "Rancho de Tia Rosa, I shall return!" 

Best Mexican food on Earth! And Fransisco is my new favorite super hero.

Thanks Fransisco!
