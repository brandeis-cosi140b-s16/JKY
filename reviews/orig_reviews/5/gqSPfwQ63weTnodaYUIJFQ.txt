Hands down best tacos that you can get in the USA.

They are the normal size, so small. But we got them with everything on them and the salsa and cilantro were super fresh and great. 

We order the abadoba & CARNE Asada tacos. I also ordered a quesadilla and tostada and they aren't worth the extra 2 bucks. Just go the right way with the tacos, they are amazing.

Pay attention to the lines they are confusing.
