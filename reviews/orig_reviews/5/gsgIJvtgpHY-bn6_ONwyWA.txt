Talk about awesome! This is one of my favorite local restaurants and has some of the best mexican food in the valley. 

My all time favorite is the lunch menu item, "Letter J". Also known as the Pollo Rico. This is a delicious helping of chicken chimi covered in a jalape√±o cheese sauce that is just amazing. I highly recommend this menu item.

Their chips and salsa are great and their drinks (margaritas) are just right. All in all, a great place to dine for lunch or dinner.
