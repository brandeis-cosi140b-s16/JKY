i have to admit when i first yelped this place and then drove to it... was to creeped out to go there because it looked like it was inside Sapphires the strip club... lol so i didn't go... another time... i was ironically IN Sapphires... was hungry as hell... and remembered that it was just next door... i went over there and ordered a chicken quesadilla... it was THE BEST CHICKEN QUESADILLA OF MY LIFE... it was life changing.  I can't even describe it... it was like as i was eating it i heard birds chirping and unicorns were running about on tufts of grass... lol anyways... try this place out... for it being next door to the club...and even sharing walls... you cant at all hear all the noise.
