I cannot express how I long for Gallo's tacos, gaccamole, and their fries. Not living in the phoenix area anymore, I think of them often and know that when I am back I will be stopping again for a meal. 

Food is always good, tastey and fresh. The service has always been wonderful, and the chef has even been out to our table to see if we were enjoying ourselves. The atmosphere is casual and relaxing with great art to look at. I highly recomend to anyone loocing for a great casual meal.
