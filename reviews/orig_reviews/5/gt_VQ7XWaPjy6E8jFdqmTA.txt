I frequent this fine restaurant and have always found the food and service to be above reproach. Today they outdid themselves, delivering my lunch order by hand even though that's not a service they offer. The bartender (Lorne) knew I was short staffed at my work and took the time to bring my phone order to me at my nearby business without asking! This is the kind of service that makes this restaurant really great.
