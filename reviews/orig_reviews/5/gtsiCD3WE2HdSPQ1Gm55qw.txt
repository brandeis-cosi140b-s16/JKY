Simply awesome. A little bit off the beaten path inside Caesars, but well worth the extra walk. We liked the place so much we went back the next night!

Everything is great from start (the chips and dips) to finish (the exotic ice cream flavors). Appetizers come in generous portions. And the ceviches have a healthy assortment of fresh veggies.

I also have to echo another post here which praised the GM. She's keeping close watch to make sure everything is top notch.

So stop debating whether or not to go. Just do it! You'll be glad you did.
