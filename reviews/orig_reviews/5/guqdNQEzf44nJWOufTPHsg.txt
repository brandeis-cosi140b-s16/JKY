I used to live for 21 years literally 5 minutes walking distance from Tacos El Gordo and never once tried it. Oh how I wish I could take back those wasted years without their tacos. Tacos El Gordo has literally the BEST tacos and Mexican food in Las Vegas. And I've tried just about every taco truck and authentic Mexican food place I've come across since I was born and raised here. My personal favorite is the adobada and carne asada tacos. Meat is seasoned well, and so juicy. All the tacos are loaded with toppings like guacamole and pico de gallo too. Now I live on the opposite side of town and am regretting I took advantage of Tacos El Gordo in the past.
