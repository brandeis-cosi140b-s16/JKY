I visited this place after reading the great reviews. I was in the general area for work and enjoy the places locals go to. 

This place did not disappoint. I have always been weird about fish tacos and never really gotten into them. Since this place was very reasonable with prices ($1 carne asada tacos / $1.50 fish tacos) I decided to take the plunge. I ate it last after taking one bite because I personally save the best for last. Both tacos were excellent and despite outside appearances, this place was delicious.
