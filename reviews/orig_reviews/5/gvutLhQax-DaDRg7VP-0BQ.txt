Finally, after four years in Pittsburgh, I found a real Hispanic grocery store, and it comes with a real taco stand.  I've been grudgingly going to a well-known place in the Strip that charges 20-50% more for a not-so-great selection, but I shall shop there no more now that I've found Las Palmas.  Fully stocked grocery store with great produce (huge pile of tomatillos) and meat - everything you need to make that recipe you found in your favorite Diana Kennedy cookbook.  (Cheap Inca Kola!  Found my fix.)

Most of you are more interested in the tacos, and I'll confirm that you can't go wrong there, either.  Real tacos - I tried puerco, barbacoa, and asada.  All were very good; the pork was exceptional - muy rica.  These are the real deal for street tacos, too - just like what I found in Atlanta and San Diego in past lives.  Only $2 (never pay $3 for a taco), and they're stuffed with easily twice as much fillin's as what you'll get at any other taco place in town.  (Note to their competition: tacos shouldn't be huge, but they're not appetizers, either.  I'm tired of eating three at the trendier places and still being hungry.  Four with no sides should completely stuff an adult male.)  The "fixin's" station is nice, too - faster and easier than having to wait on "the guy" to put it on.

Four stars for the grocery store and five for the taco stand.  (...And the grocery store takes credit cards.  Hint, hint to all the local shops/restaurants that don't.)
