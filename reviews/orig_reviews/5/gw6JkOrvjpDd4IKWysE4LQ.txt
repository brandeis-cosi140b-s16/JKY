Wow!!  This place turned out to be a delicious surprise for my husband and I!

This is not the same generic Mexican food you get at many restaurants around the east valley.  It is Mexico City style and almost everything has a bold, homemade taste.  They have great vegetarian options as well.

High points:  The cheese and shredded beef quesadilla appetizer... my husband said it was the best he has had (and he orders quesadillas everywhere!).  The chile relleno... oh my gosh, where do I begin?!  The chile was huge and flavorful.  The cheese and egg complimented it well but the star was the sauce.  I have not had any sauce like this rich, peppery, buttery delicious sauce that was slathered over the chile.  It was perfection! 

The atmosphere was colorful and relaxed.  You can watch the kitchen staff make your meal through a long set of windows.  It seems very clean.  Service could be a little more happy but they still did their jobs well.  

Don't let the mediocre salsas that they serve at the beginning of the meal fool you. The appetizers and entrees are worth every penny!  Enjoy!
