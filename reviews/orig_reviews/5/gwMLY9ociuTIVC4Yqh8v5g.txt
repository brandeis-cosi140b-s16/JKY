I've heard so many good things about this place but never got a chance to try it out. I came here in the afternoon and it definitely felt homey inside. A young lady greeted me and asked if I had been here for before? So glad that was the first thing she asked me because I hate going to new places and just looking at the menu like uhhhh?? And they just expect you to know how their menu works. But anyways, I said no and she let me try pieces of the Kalua pig, steak, and chicken. The Kalua pig was so delicious. It was moist and juicy and tender. The steak had this special sauce that tasted kinda sweet and was thick but it was spot on. I got the 3 tacos and got Kalua pig on two tacos and the steak on the other one. I liked how I could change my choice of protein on my taco order. I got to choose what I wanted to add to the tacos and it was packaged securely. I did also get a fountain drink and total came out to around $10. Not bad. 
Got home and it was still warm and it tasted so good! Next time I go I'll make sure to try something else on their menu.
