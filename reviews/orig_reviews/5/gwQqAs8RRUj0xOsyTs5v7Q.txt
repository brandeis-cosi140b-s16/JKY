I'm writing this review because I'm craving one (okay 4) of their chicken tacos right NOW. Mmmmm. If you've been out drinking all night this place is perfect to curb your munchies. Affordable $2 tacos & $3 strawberry margaritas a few of each will leave your wallet and tummy satisfied. We ate here almost everyday it's pretty additive.
