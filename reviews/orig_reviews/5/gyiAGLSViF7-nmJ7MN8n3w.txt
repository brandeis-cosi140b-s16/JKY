I heard this was the best place to get Mexican food on the strip so being the foodie that I am, I optimistically accepted the challenge. At first I thought, how good can a place be that's located at the mall. Seriously? So I brought my group with me to put this rumor to the test.  In short, we were all blown away. 

Our food was fresh, flavorful and unique.  Each dish we ordered had its own El Segundo Sol flair to popular Mexican dishes. It was so good that we stuffed ourselves silly. We couldn't stop! From friendly staff and excellent customer service to delicious appetizers, drinks, meals and desserts, I would highly recommend this place. 

The rumor is true- this is the best Mexican food on the strip and I'm now a lifetime fan and customer. Take a gamble, grab a drink on the patio, order a few things and enjoy this hidden LV gem.
