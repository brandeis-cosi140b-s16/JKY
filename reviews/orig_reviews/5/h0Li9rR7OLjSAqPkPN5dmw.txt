The best tacos al pastor I think you can get in the US. Beats anything I've tried so far that wasn't actually in Mexico, and that says something. Hell, it's better than some of the Mexican spots I've frequented when I lived there. Their carne asada is great, their carnitas cuts are excellent, their sauces are flavorful, the service is fast and loose (it is kind of like a fast food joint), their aguas frescas are varied and sweet, and they have a huge selection of paletas to help you stave off the Vegas heat.

One of my favorite stops in Las Vegas every year.
