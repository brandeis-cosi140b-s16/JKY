Being from Arizona I've been hard pressed to find a Mexican food restaurant that holds up. Mundo is the first place I've been in Vegas (only been here for 3 years and certainly open to suggestions) that really stacks up to the authentic Sonoran Mexican food served just one state to our south. 

Strong work Mundo, keep it up. 

Also, the Margaritas are pretty darn tasty
