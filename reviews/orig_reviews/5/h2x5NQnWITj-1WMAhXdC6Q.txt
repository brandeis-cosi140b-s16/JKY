This place is amazing. From the very first time I came here I was treated like a regular, and that assured that I will be. My boyfriend tells the tale of the epic spicy burrito that he was unable to finish (he was offered a refund too), I finally nutted up and tried it myself. It was epic. Nothing here has ever been shy of amazing. The food is great, I dig the divey atmosphere and I love how every single person in that kitchen looks happy to be there and happy to be with each other.
