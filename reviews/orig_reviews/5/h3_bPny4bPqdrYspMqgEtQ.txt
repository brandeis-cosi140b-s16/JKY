This is my favorite spot in Gilbert, I've been here like 6 times now and every time I have something great. The second I saw Fry Bread I knew I had to have it. Their meat here be it the carne asada, the chicken or the pork are all seasoned well and taste incredible. I think the steak (Carne Asada) is the best of the three fry breads I have had. The Chicken tacos the best taco and the Chorizo burrito the best burrito (But I haven't had the carne asada burrito). Nice little place with a free chip/salsa bar and delicous food. If you're in the Gilbert Area and want some delicous food or have been craving Fry Bread you need to come here.
