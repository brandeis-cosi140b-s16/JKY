Great food and service. Both time i dined at Tako i sat at the outside bar and service was great, food excellent and drinks amazing! Prices are very reasonable, two taco's for $12-$14. I would suggest you cehck this place out while in town. Its small and very busy so get there before the dinner rush or after.
