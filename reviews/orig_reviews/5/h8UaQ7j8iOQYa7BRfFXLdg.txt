I love it when places keep it pretty simple.  

I came here for breakfast on the recommendation of several friends who have been here.  Now, I wasn't sure if I could accurately judge the place based on breakfast offerings.  But that was the time I could get over here during my business trip.  So breakfast it was.  

One burrito with egg, potato and chorizo later, and I see why everyone I know who has been here raves about the place.  

I didn't eat anything overly creative here.  It was just a straightforward breakfast burrito.  But man, if I lived and worked here everyday, I'd get this for breakfast everyday.  It's one of those perfect everyday choices that would make me happy to get up in the morning.  

My dining companions got items that looked even more appetizing to me.  It was so that I was actually jealous of what they ate.  Which of course means that when I'm back in town I'm getting what they got.  

But it will be tough for me to turn down that burrito.
