I decided on one of my favs, Cafe Rio. I had a huge chicken burrito, enchilada style. Everything was fresh and pretty tasty. I did have to ask for a little more cheese, but the girl that created my masterpiece happily obliged. 
I had some change that I wanted to get rid of and asked the cashier if I could use a roll of dimes I had from my change drawer at work. This girl broke it open and started counting it as if it didn't already say $5 on roll. She clearly doesn't attend ULVN...a sweetheart nevertheless. Lol
