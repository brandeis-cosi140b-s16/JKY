aaaaahhh-MAIZE-ing!!! And, no... this place is not over-hyped! This little taco shack on the corner of Green & 1st is life changing. Friendly staff that serve up fresh, hot, flavorful food with smiles! Yes, it is tiny and cramped (bar seating for less than 15 people). Yes, the parking lot sucks. Yes, there are times where the line is out the door and around the building. But it is all worth it!! 

I'd highly recommend the Volcanes. Grilled cheese taco with your choice of meat... It's like a quesadilla and taco had a tasty love baby. Yummy! I really enjoyed the carne asada, pastor and chorizo. The chips and salsa were delicious, too! 

Btw... just found out that they are opening a second location this summer on Chestnut where Luna used to be!

Peace, love & tacos!
