Love this place. Consistent as can be, and service is top notch.
One might think, "Hmm fajitas - doesn't that usually mean dry chicken and stiff steak?"
(at least that's what I thought) but I've been proven wrong time and time again at Juan's. Juan's fajitas are the benchmark of fajitas. It's almost as if the meats/proteins come out slightly rare on purpose, knowing that they will be the perfect temperature in about 30 flaming seconds, or the time in which it takes to assemble your first fajita and nab a first bite.

If you like fajitas, you will LOVE this place.
If you don't like fajitas, try Juan's and you will understand why fajitas exist.

(Awesome salsa and bean dip, too.)
