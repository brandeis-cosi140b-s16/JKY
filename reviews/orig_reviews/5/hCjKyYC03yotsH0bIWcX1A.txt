First review ever...mainly because I can't get over how amazing the combination nachos are.  By far the cheesiest, meatiest nachos ever.

Not to mention the service.  Megan,  our waitress,  made sure that our drinks were always full and that our bellies were happy.

Once of the best vegas stops ever. Will definitely be coming back.
