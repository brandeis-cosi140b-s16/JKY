Dick's is one of my top 5 all time favorite restaurants. 

The ambiance - intimate, dark, rustic, wood, copper. 

Sitting at the bar, watching your food being cooked right in front of you. 

The rack of lamb is sublime. The "Taos Combo" or anything on the special board, especially seafood, is always incredible. Their margaritas, cocktails, wine - all great. Bacon wrapped shrimp ftw. They come on a plate with a tortilla on the bottom, rice, beans, and sauce on top, and the bacon wrapped shrimp on top of that. The salad, which comes with many entrees, is awesome. And don't forget the flan, topped with prickly pear syrup. You can't go wrong. 

It's a testament to how good this place is that they don't need a sign.
