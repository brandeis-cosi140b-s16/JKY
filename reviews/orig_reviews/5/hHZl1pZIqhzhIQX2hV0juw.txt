Delicioso! 

This is a neighborhood hole in the wall that serves some pretty great mole. I am a mole fiend. Love the stuff. Can't get enough. Their's is dark, rich, spicy, and the right amount of sweet. (Also how I like my men, hey-o). 

(Just kidding.) 

Also, who doesn't love a salsa bar? I've never even heard of most of them: pecan salsa? peanut salsa? Um, why are you only giving me 4 lids for the to-go cups? Like I'm not going to try them all ...
