Just got back home from our week long family vacation in Las Vegas.  We were starving after our visit to the Shark Reef so we stopped in for the Sunday brunch before leaving and it was amazing!  We had several children in our party and our server Rachel S. was a DREAM!  My kids adored her.  She was very patient!  Loved the food and the experience... will def be making this a regular stop for upcoming trips.
