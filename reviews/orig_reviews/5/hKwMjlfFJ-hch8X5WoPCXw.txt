This place is very good.  I am a native of AZ and know good Mexican.  Great atmosphere, great food, and not too pricey.  Last time there I tried the El Monterrey.  AWESOME!  Tons of food.  4 enchiladas, a chile relleno, a taco, and rice and beans.  If you want a real treat try the dulce de leche cheesecake.  They have down-sized it a bit since they opened, but it is mondo tasty.
