Had dinner at Hussongs during our last vegas trip. Food was great!! We ate free chips and salsa and washed it down with one of the strongest margaritas ive ever had. I ordered the steak tacos, which were a tad on the greasy side, but still delicious. The best thing was the ticket times-- took no more than 20 mins from the time we sat down to the time we were paying the check.
