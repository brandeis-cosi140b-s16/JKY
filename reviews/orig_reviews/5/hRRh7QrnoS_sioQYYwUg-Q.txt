Was told I would love the Tacos.......

So of course I wanted to try the Kahlua Pig, Chicken and Fish Tacos --- on a 3 Tacos platter they allow you to mix it up and I sure did!   These were the BEST Tacos I ever had.....they let you decide what you want on each Taco or Burrito and I loaded them up with everything including Payaya Ranch Dressing on the side.

These were awesome and I will be sure to be going back real real soon !
