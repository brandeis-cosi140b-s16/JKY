Get your passport, we're going to Mexico.

Can't find your passport?  Still waiting for it from the State Department?  No worries, pack your bag and head to the Ranch Market!

This place is the best!  The food court is wonderful with so many tasty dishes.  And the produce department is crazy!  2 lbs of grapes for 99 cents, 8 cucumbers for a dollar, 17 cents for a bunch of cilantro, 7 -- YES, SEVEN pounds of watermelon for 99 cents.  You can go crazy with produce and not break the bank.  

The tamales are huge and the tortillas, oh the tortillas. 

Don't be frightened, don't get intimidated, it's just a grocery store people!
