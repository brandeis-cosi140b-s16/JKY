Roasted garlic plate: Orgasmic. Slow-roasted, sweet, smoky, soft spreadable ginormous cloves of stinky heaven, served with an array of mysterious dips and spreads, all warm and covered in melted cheese, ready for the spreadin'. 

For the times when I expect to kiss my boyfriend again in the next five days, I forgo the garlicky goodness for veggie quesadillas (not on the menu, people): whatever veggies they have back there (broccolini, beets, Brussels sprouts, carrots, whatevs) folded into a delicious tortilla with just enough cheese. Served on a cutting board with amazing salsa on the side.... Nom nom nom.

No place else like it. Hands down. Eagerly awaiting Richardson's triumphant return....
