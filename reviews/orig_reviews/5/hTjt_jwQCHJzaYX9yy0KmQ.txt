They have by far some of the best queso I've ever had!!! The guacamole is out of this world as well!! I visited Bakersfield again this week for probably the fourth or fifth time over the past few months. Once again, I left very pleased with the whole experience - food, service, atmosphere. This visit we did notice that the music was very loud that it was almost hard for the 3 of us to have s conversation. I ordered the Milanesa sandwich and loved it! After filling up on queso and guac, I ended up bringing half of the sandwich home for lunch the next day. The guys I was with ordered 3 tacos each and nearly inhaled them so I'm guessing they were delicious as well. We will definitely be back again in the near future!
