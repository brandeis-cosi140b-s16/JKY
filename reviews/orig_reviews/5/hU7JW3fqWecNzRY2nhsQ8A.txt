I'm a huge fan of mad mex when I visit Pittsburgh. It would do well out here in Los Angeles. The salsa is good but we always go straight to the queso. I usually get the wingarito tacos. It's a ton of food and it's all good. They obviously source their fries from the same vendor as chick fil a. So if I'm craving non hateful fries I can get them here. Always great service too.
