I am from Texas and did not know what to expect from a Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas.  I opted for the buffet for $13.99 ($14.99 with beverage).  The cheese enchiladas were sooooo gooooood!!!  Also, on the buffet was beef and chicken breast fajitas (not thigh meat), build your own tacos and taco salad, and flour and corn tortillas.  Chips with three different kinds of dipping sauces were delivered to our table.  Our waiter was extremely friendly, encouraging us to "stat as long as you like...it's hot out there."  Two thumbs way up!!
