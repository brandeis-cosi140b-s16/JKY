Wow! This place is really, no really really good..I wanted to take another plate home with me but refrained (since I was with a group).  I has the enchilada dinner and it was plate licking good..I ate everything..even the beans which my boyfriend reminded that I don't like beans.  The salsa verde I could drink by the gallon and the margarita packed a punch without tasting overwhelmingly like tequila...I will be dreaming about this place until I can go back...Saturday afternoon...no wait/line...great service too!
