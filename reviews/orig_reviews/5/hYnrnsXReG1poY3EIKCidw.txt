Having lived in New Mexico while in the USAF, I grew to love the cuisine.  With La Ristra here in Gilbert, I can now get my Green Chili Fix whenever I need to... which is often.  The staff here are extremely friendly and will take the time to explain the menu and give their recommendations.   The Blue Corn Enchiladas are a must.  The portion sizes are generous and will most likely prompt the to - go box!  So glad my wife and I were recommended to try this awesome eatery
