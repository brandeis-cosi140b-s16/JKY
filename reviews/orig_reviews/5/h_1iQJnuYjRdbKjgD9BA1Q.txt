i'm so sad that my new favorite restaurant is all the way in vegas!!!!!!! i guess we'll just have to plan more trips :oD

i'm a major creature of habit so my bf took me here without giving me much choice. and im sooo glad he "forced" me!!! hehe. it was both of our first time at agave, and we were in awe. 

we waited about 25 mins to sit at the patio. it was a long wait on an empty stomach, but well worth it. enjoyed the margarita tonala (strawberry margarita) as we waited. the decor is beautiful!!!!! i loved the restrooms. check out the sinks.... pretty dope! and the gorgeous mirror outside the restrooms.... can i take it home?!?!?! 

patio was very nice & romantic. a few fireplaces to sit and have drinks by. 
they served 3 different salsas that were yummy. my boyfriend ordered the duck quesadillas. they were sooo good and full of flavor!! i got the potato and portabello mushroom tacos!!!!! oh my heart. how can something veggie taste sooo good! they give you 3 stuffed tacos and they are with hard BLUE corn tortillas! never seen this before. the hard tacos gave it great texture. 

the staff was really nice & attentive. decor and ambience was amazing. location is great, right across from red rock hotel & casino. & wasn't expensive at all!!!! it was about $30 for both of us. you gotta try this place! we'll def be coming back on our next vegas trip.
