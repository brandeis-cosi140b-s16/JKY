Came here for dinner with my wife after hearing good reviews from friends. The restaurant was very busy but we were seated immediately. Service was fast and friendly and the food was amazing. I ordered the Buffalo Chicken Nachos and my wife had the veggie burrito.

The Buffalo Chicken Nachos were absolutely out of this world. I tried my wife's burrito, but I had already tasted the nachos, so I was definitely grading on the curve at that point. My wife loved the burrito, so overall it was a win-win.

Our server was very "on top of it" during our entire meal. Checking in on us to make sure we were enjoying ourselves. We even got a table-side visit from Anthony, the manager who wanted to make sure we were having a good time. 

Overall, it was a great dining experience. I left with a full, happy belly and have been dreaming of going back for more Buffalo Chicken Nachos for the last week.
