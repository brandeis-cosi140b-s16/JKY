I came here for a light snack and was really pleasantly surprised by how good it was! I had the Tiny Estiffy, two mini seasoned ground beef chimichangas, topped with a really tasty orange sauce and cheese. I also had a few bites of their Carnitas Burrito and that was a great choice as well. Even their tortilla chips were good! I'll definitely pay them another visit to try more items from their extensive menu.
