I'm surprised at the low reviews because this was actually one of the best places we ate at in Vegas in terms of food, price, and service. Our server, Dione, was friendly and fast. Fast service is almost impossible to find on The Strip, so that deserves more credit than maybe it does in other parts of the country. It's also worth noting that the manager came around to check on us, too, which is a nice touch to make sure we were taken care of. The food was better than expected, and the prices are pretty reasonable when compared to the other restaurants in the area. Some of the folks on here complain about the music being too loud, which is funny because I commented while we were eating the volume was perfect for enjoying the music while still being able to hold a conversation. Personally, I think it's a bit silly to complain about music volume when "cantina" is in the name and you can hear the music as you're walking in.
