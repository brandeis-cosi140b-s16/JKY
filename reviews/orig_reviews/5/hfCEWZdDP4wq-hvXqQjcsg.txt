This place is great for happy hour. $2 tacos, $5 32oz Coronas and Tecates and $5 margaritas. There tacos are delicious especially after a couple cervezas. They play great music, have good service and oh, did I mention a beer tap at your table? Not one of those tall things that pour 5 or 6 beers, and actual tap hooked up to a keg of Dos Equis and Coors light. I haven't stayed long enough to see this place morph into a night club, but it is worth checking out for happy hour anyday from 3-7PM.
