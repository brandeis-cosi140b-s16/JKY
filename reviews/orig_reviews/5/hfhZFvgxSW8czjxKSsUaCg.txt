Although I have only lived in Charlotte for 5 months, I have visited Cantina 1511 three times. I was initally drawn in by the promise of half priced pitchers of margaritas but the food was so incredible and the service so nice that I have returned twice just to keep sampling the vast menu. 

This past week I met up with two girlfriends for some great food and a little chitchat. The chips and two kinds of salsa that appear on the table could almost sustain me for the evening but I knew there were entrees calling my name. I have celiac disease so I need to avoid gluten and sometimes that can be a problem when I eat out. However, when I asked the server to point me toward menu items made with corn tortillas she immediately asked, do you not eat gluten? I was impressed. She showed me what items are n ormally made with corn tortillas but then told me that I could order any quesadilla with corn instead of flour tortillas and said she would check with the kitchen for anything else I might be interested in. How nice!

I ended up splitting the Enchiladas de Dennis with my friend. The waitress said they were one of the most popular menu items. They were so delicious. Corn tortillas stuffed with chicken and spinach and cheeses. Yummy! We all enjoyed dinner and I cannot wait to go back and try something else.
