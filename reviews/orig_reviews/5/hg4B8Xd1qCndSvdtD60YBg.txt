Wow.  The pork adobado tacos are simply the shiznit.

This place is right up there with the best tacos I've had ever in my long life of taco eating.  It's not like a regular pastor taco, cut a little thicker.  The meat is so tender and juicy and flavorful.  I couldn't get enough of that pork.  The carne asada was average at best but the puerco more than makes up for the beef's mediocrity.  

They give you a creamy green sauce (avocado cream?  cilantro cream?)  and a righteous red sauce.  I can't imagine a better taco (til i open mine very own taqueria.  stay tuned for that).

Great, fresh, delicate corn tortillas, meat, onion. cilantro, self-admistered sauces.  Great tacos.  Thank you, el gordo.  I love you...
