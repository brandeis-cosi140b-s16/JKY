Every now and then, you stumble into a restaurant that has just the right mix of attentive staff, authentic food and reasonable prices. The Border Grill in the Mandalay Bay has all the components mentioned above. In fact, they have motivated me to write this glowing review.

Our server, Autumn D was outstanding. She treated us like family and guided us through the menu like a professional. Autumn was on point with all of her recommendations. From the pomegranate limeade to the shrimp relleno tacos, we could not be happier with our dinner. 


The food is pricey by the taco shop standards in San Diego. That said, The Border Grill is a modern restaurant in a beautiful hotel in Las Vegas. The menu prices are entirely reasonable when you consider the facts. 

Not to mention the quality ingredients and expert preparation that cost a little more. The kitchen is not afraid to roast chiles here and stuff them with delicious shrimp. Those are some damn good tacos. Put them on the permanent menu if possible. 

This meal was well worth the trip, and I look forward to visiting again. Here is what we had to eat...


Guacamole with chips
Tacos de rajas
Pescado Veracruzana
Shrimp stuffed poblano chile tacos 
Banana cream pie 
Mexican Chocolate cream pie
