If I were rating my first friday experience I would have to say 3/5, but thankfully I made the choice to go back this evening and I was pleased to see that the enthusiastic staff made many changes that makes Paz a 5/5 experience for sure! 

With the removal of the chaos that comes with opening night that was only compounded by first Friday and a live band, the team at Paz was attentive and the quality of my food and drinks skyrocketed! They defiantly took the critiques from Friday to heart and turned this place into one of my fave new spots. 

I highly recommend giving this place a shot (or a second chance).  I can't wait to see what they do as they grow, considering what they did in 21 days from concept to opening day these guys definitely have the talent to succeed. 

P.S. Love the gallery feel with the local art and I highly recommend the queso with a little bit of their bomb salsa verde mixed in, YUM!
