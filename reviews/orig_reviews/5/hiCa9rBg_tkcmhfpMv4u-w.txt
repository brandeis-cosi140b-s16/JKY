Third time eating here as the tacos are all amazing and so is the Crispy Lace wontons! Haven't tried much else - worth the price compared to the pricier restaurants at the Cosmopolitan i have also been to. Salt air margaritas are great but have some drinks before you get here- they're 14 bucks each and are small!
