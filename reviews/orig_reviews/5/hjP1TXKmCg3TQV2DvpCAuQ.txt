I work near the Fashion Show Mall so we go to El Segundo Sol at least once a month for lunch. I have to admit it is hard not to order margaritas when every one else around you is getting one, but I do refrain! (I will stop by someday and get them as everyone on yelp is raving about them.) 

Service has always reliable. They know the menu well and are good at making suggestions even when we don't follow them. ;-) They are quick to refill water or soft drinks. And of course the food is always awesome! We have had the combo fajitas several times and they are the current fav. Nachos and guac is our standard appetizer as well and it always disappear quickly.... 

You know, I think I'll go to lunch there today!!
