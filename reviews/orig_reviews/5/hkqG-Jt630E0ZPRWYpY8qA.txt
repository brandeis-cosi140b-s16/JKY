Absolutely loved this place. I drove by on my way to my doctors appointment and saw the sign. I was so excited and always to try their place across town but never made it there. I decided to swing by after my appointment. 

As soon as I opened the door I was greeted with a big "aloha". For a second there I thought I was back home. They gave me a sample bowl right away and asked me what I though of the kalua pig. It was Ono!, but since I was making it myself for Easter I went with the chicken and the steak tacos. I loved the fact that I was able to order 3 different kinds with my order at no extra charge. 

The food was very favorable and very filling. I will definitely be back to try other menu items.
