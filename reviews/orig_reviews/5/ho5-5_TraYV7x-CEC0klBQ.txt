No frills, crazy good.

It's take-out/fast-food mexican but don't let that fool you, this place is special. Best taco/burrito in Vegas, and yes, I've been to Taco y Taco, I've been to El Gordo, I've been to Pepes, Tacos Mexico, Tacos N' Beer, El Dorado, and so on... For that reason, I probably hit this drive thru more times in a month than all other drive thrus combined in a year... crack! Asada is my fav and the pollo is also great, I like the burrito, quesadilla and tacos (in that order). Not sure about the seafood coctal, I see people order it all the time but it's too sweet for me. I'm partial to the Charleston location but they're both consistent. They mess up my order 25% of the time and it's a different price everytime, AND I DON'T EVEN CARE, it's that good!

Cons - Not open very late... or very early (maybe that's for the better).
