Bret has it dialed in! Paradise Valley Burger Co. is a gem. It's a hole-in-the-wall with ridiculously tasty burgers. Just had the burger brulee (fried egg, bacon, onion, burnt sugar, and havarti) and the beach house (roasted green chile, smoked mozzarella, and pico de gallo). Kudos to another local, independent restaurant!!
