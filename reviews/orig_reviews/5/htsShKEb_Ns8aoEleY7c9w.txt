I want to keep this short and sweet. We went last night. This was hands down the best Mexican food I have ever had, and everything was amazing. Everything was so delicious. It's super expensive yes, but a great place to go for a special occasion (it was our anniversary). I absolutely loved it. Service was superb as well and our waiter (he was awesome) had tried everything on the menu and was very knowledgeable about the dishes. So happy we went here! Will definitely be back at some point.
