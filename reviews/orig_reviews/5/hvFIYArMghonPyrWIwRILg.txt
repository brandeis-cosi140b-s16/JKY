Fantastic food. Had their BBQ chicken bowl and crispy cod bowl. The crispy cod was excellent, just enough fish and crispness to work together! Definitely recommend choosing the coconut rice, it's very different. Also, the roasted garlic beet sauce is very tangy and very good. 

Had their chocolate coconut sundae, a bit disappointed because no hard shell of chocolate so it was mostly just coconut ice cream but it was very good soft serve and their coconut whipped cream is fantastic!! Would definitely recommend this place, it's also very trendy and the ambience is casual and fun.
