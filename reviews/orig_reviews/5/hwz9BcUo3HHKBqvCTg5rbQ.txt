We chose this restaurant based on it's proximity to the hotel plus it's status on YELP and couldn't have been more pleased. The food and service here were nothing short of amazing. I couldn't decide what to order because the selection was ginormous and chose a combination place consisting of 1 enchilada, 1 chili relleno and a hard taco with rice, beans and their famous slaw. The cost for this ... on the largest plate I've ever seen ... was only $9.99. AMAZING! I had plenty to take home and devour later, which always makes me happy. There is a table side guacamole cart that is nothing short of incredible that you absolutely have to partake of. We ordered ours with all of the ingredients and couldn't help making the 'mmmmm' sound with the first bite. I never considered cilantro in making guacamole.  We ordered the small and it was plenty for the two of us.  We also treated ourselves to a pitcher of margaritas. The price for this HUGE pitcher was $25 and would have been a sufficient amount for 4 people. The two of us overindulged .. ;) .. and had plenty left over that we had to leave behind on the table. It seemed such a waste of the best margaritas (the ingredients were perfectly proportioned) that I have had in a long time. Actually thinking of coming back here before I leave Charlotte. OUTSTANDING.
