Fantastic breakfast! Great food and great service with an incredible ambiance! We had a beautiful morning breakfast early at this great spot. 

I had the special and my Mother had the Clasico eggs and bacon. 

The coffee is wonderful and our server Clint was friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive. 

Thank you for a great start to the day!
