Though some picky foodies turn their noses up on the americanized, overly cheesy, ginormous portions at this cafe...this is why this place is great! From the strong and flavorful margaritas to the burrito smothered with jalape√±o cream cheese (I could bathe in this stuff), we have not had a bad meal here. Service has always been on point and the atmosphere is always laid back and inviting. So sniff at the chips all you want, I will gladly take your portion! :)
