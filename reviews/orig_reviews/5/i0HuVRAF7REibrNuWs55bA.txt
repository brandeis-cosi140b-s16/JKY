Outdoor patio, separate nice cantina with televisions to watch your favorite game or event, five gaming machines to try your luck, and a separate well appointed restaurant.   Living in south Texas for the last twenty five years this is the closest I have found resembling the delicious flavor or TexMex.   Signature flaming fajitas are a treat to the eyes and the taste buds.    Great weekend brunch offerings.   Salsa chips and bean dip welcome every customer!
