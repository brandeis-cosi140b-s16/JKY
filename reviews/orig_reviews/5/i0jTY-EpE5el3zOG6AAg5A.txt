Executive summary:  We stayed in Vegas for 12 days; we ate at Phrank's four times.

There's Mexican food that's good for a hangover.  There's Mexican food that's good for kids.  Then, there's Phrank's.  Phrank is a humble man, and he claims that it's tough for him to put his finger on what makes his family's place so awesome.  I'll try to lay it out for you:

1.  The meat is unbelievably well prepared.  The carnitas are the perfect mix of seasoned tender goodness with that bit of crispiness on the top.  The chicken was moist, plump, perfectly seasoned, and changed our lives.  If giving up all my worldly possessions would result in my being able to eat the barbacoa every day, I would seriously consider it.

2.  The menu is not the typical hundred item monster that you find at your standard taqueria.  Phrank and Phamily know what they're good at, and they stick to it.

3.  Service, service, service.  This family knows how to keep customers happy.
