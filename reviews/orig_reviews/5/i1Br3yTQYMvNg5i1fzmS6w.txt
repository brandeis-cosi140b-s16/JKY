Jade Red Chicken, jerk chicken burro. Jerk fried rice.

Thinking about the jade red chicken makes me drool. And the weekend cookies. I've never quite had a oatmeal cookie like that.

There's a ton of food, a ton of combinations, and they serve you quick.

It looks like a dump, but trust me, I'd be here everyday if I could.

JADE RED CHICKEN. I said it again because you must get this.
