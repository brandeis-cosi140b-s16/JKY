Love this place! Newbies are offered a "taste test" of the various kinds of meat ( employees gladly do this; no attitude present). Food is made assembly line style (ala Chipotle ) but in a smaller, family-business setting. They put their resources into a great product so the space is simple, clean and comfortable ( quirky decor actually..I quite like it!). Load up on napkins, as the meats are juicy and messy, but I mean that in the best way possible! 
If you're not in this area and you find yourself anywhere nearby, this definitely should make you list of places to try!
