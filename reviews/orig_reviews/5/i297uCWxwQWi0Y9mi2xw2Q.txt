I found this place using Yelp, and it is a tucked-away treasure. We happened to wander in on a Monday night and we're lucky to learn Mondays come with a 25% locals discount. Prices were really reasonable anyway, with most dishes under $15 a plate. The guacamole was fresh and amazing. The chips were fine vessels to deliver the three kinds of delicious fresh salsa. All the dishes we had were amazing. My husband ordered the Carne asada, and said usually when he gets it other places it is only tender when it is hot but this stayed juicy throughout. My son had a burrito- he doesn't even like  Mexican food and said it was fantastic. The cilantro rice was yum. I had the street tacos- you can mix and match- so I had one chicken and two beef. All slow-roasted, each perfect.  The food was clean- not the over-piled plates of many Mexican restaurants that trade in quantity for quality. Portions were perfect-sized and we took home some leftovers. To top it off, our server Christopher was fast and courteous, really really excellent service, the kind that shows up exactly when you need it, not missing a beat. He was friendly without unnecessary check-ins and seemed legit happy. The chef brought out a piece of flan that we shared between the five of us- necessary because we all stuffed ourselves on dinner. It was the best flan I've ever had. Chef Paco said it was his mom's recipe, from Mexico City. All five of us large hungry adults ate for $75, feeling satisfied about a really great meal. I love this place. Highly recommended.
