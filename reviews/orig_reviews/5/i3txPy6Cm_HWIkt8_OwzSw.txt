I was here last week just as they were about to close...really felt bad about that.  However one of the workers waved us on in from the inside so my friend and I got out and ventured in.  We decided not to eat inside since they were already cleaning the dining room, but that's no problem.  The lady helping us order was super helpful, offering samples of the horchata and explaining the menu to us.  

I went with the Fajita Burrito with Carnitas.  I have to say it was probably one of the best burritos I've ever had.  And the beans that come with it...absolutely delicious!  

My friend ordered the Enchiladas Suizas with Chicken - I just had one bite but it was very tasty...he enjoyed them as well.  

The chips and guacamole were great as well.  The guac looked a little bland when I opened up the container (which was huge!) but it wasn't bland at all - definitely had a kick to it!

The salsa bar was also a nice addition.  We loaded up on every type of salsa they had just to try it out.  There's also sour cream and pickled jalapenos/carrots.  

I'll definitely be going back!
