A solid five stars! The food is excellent, the staff was extremely helpful, knowledgable and fun to talk to. The bartender rocked with lots of different specialty drinks. Ask him about Bitters! This place is just an all around cool stop off. Only down is the ordering area and condiments bar is very close together and created a bottle neck.
