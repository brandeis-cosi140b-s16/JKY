I can't believe it has taken me so long to review! We have been visiting the Rokerij for years now, and it has only gotten better with time.

The Rokerij is actually our favorite Sunday brunch. We come almost every week and sit at the bar top, where Brittany always takes such great care for her patrons. Her bar back is one of the best in town, always keeping glasses of water full and any odds and ends delivered with our meal.

We have had just about everything on the brunch menu. The breakfast burrito is the best bang for your buck, especially with their delectable red sauce and chorizo. 

The carne adovada is fabulous. Enjoy it with a side of eggs, or as an egg Benedict dish. Wonderful!! 

Of course, their special Dutch pancake is out of this world. So sweet, but with a bit of a crunch on the outside and a fluffy center and served with warmed syrup. If you are ever presented with the opportunity, be sure to order the peppered bacon for an extra special treat with any dish!!
