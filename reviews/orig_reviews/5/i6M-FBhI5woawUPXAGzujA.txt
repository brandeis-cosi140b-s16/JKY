Stopped in while visiting Charlotte. I live near Tampa and I've never had fish tacos as good as the BBQ Mahi Tacos. Just insane. They give you the option of corn or flour tortillas, I had the flour. The tortillas were slightly grilled or fried - they were in between soft and crunchy and they were fantastic. 2 tacos for about $11, but trust me, they are huge and filling. I can't recommend these tacos enough, and Cabo Fish Taco is on my must visit list from now on when I'm in Charlotte.
