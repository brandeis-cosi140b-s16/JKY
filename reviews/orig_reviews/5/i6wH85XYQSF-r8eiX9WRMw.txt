Best Mexican food I have had in a very long time! Everything we ordered was great and cooked right. It was so authentic and tasted very home made. Coming from CA we have eaten at many Mexican restaurants and I can honestly say this is by far our favorite and its not even in Cali. It even beats a couple of places we tried in San Diego. If I start reviewing each and everything we ordered this review will easily turn into a novel because I have nothing but great things to say about everything and no one will read it because its too long, so i'll just say go there and try it out yourself. You wont be disappointed. The food speaks for itself!
