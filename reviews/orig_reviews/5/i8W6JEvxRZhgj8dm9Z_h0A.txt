I have two favorite things about Mixteca..oh make that three.

1) Breakfast burritos. I think their breakfast burritos are the best and I've tried a lot. 
2) Salsa bar!
3) Drive through - because sometimes you don't feel like getting out of the car. :-)

I pretty much only get the breakfast burritos and chips & salsa. Everyone I've shared Mixteca with seems to like it too.
