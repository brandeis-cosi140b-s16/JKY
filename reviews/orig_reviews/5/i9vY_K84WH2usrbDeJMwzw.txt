Highly impressed! The food is seriously amazing. A lot of Mexican food places are kinda "Americanized Mexican" food. This place is the real deal. My BF had the Carne Asada Torta and I had a bean and cheese burrito covered in red sauce. I usually am picky about meat, so I don't order meat often. Never been a Carne Asada fan. But after trying my BF's, I plan to order one next time. Very delicious. The staff was wonderful and friendly too. I've been a yelper for years, my BF created a Yelp account just so he can review this place. Now he is addicted to yelp like I am. 

So if you're reading this review and trying to decide whether to go or not, give it a try.
