I am so happy that they are open now on saturday. After golfing we stopped by to get their famous green chili burritos .they were nice and hot .The green chili sauce spicy and lots of green chilis.the meat was  plentiful and the extra sauce went well with their Spanish rice. Their refried beans are the best in town.thank you
