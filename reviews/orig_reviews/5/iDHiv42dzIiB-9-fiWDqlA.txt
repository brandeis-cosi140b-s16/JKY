If you are not concerned with the ambiance, this place is AWESOME!! We sat outside in a room that had no windows - but it somehow fit the restaurant nonetheless. There is a place to sit indoors as well, but we were there on a perfect evening temperature-wise. The prices of the drinks ($3.25 for a 32 oz beer!!) as well as the food itself could not be beat. My husband and I enjoyed authentic Mexican cuisine at ridiculously low prices. Would definitely visit again if we were in the area.
