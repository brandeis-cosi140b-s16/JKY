This place is so good, I dream about it. When I am dreaming about food that is!
So a few nights ago, I had been thinking about it and wanted to go here for dinner. To my surprise and not a good one, they were no longer there on Mill. Replaces by some other place. Major disappointment set in. 
But, I just found out they have moved, so Weeeeee will be going to the new one very soon. Because, they are soo good.
