Tried this place today as I recently began working in the area and drove by it a couple times. I was not disappointed. Had the Carne Asada burrito and it was hands down the best quick-serve type burrito I've had in time that I can remember. The Carne Asada was amongst the best (if not the best!) I've ever had, and the beans and cheese supplemented wonderfully. I tried their hottest salsa, it was delicious with just the right amount of heat. The burrito was comparable in size to a Chipotle burrito, but much better. The building itself is a smaller, diner type place. If you happen to be in this part of Vegas, I definitely recommend giving this place a try. Very convenient and the price is right.
