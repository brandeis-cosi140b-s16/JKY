Just to put it bluntly this is my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas. I am from New Mexico and he has the best New Mexican dishes available outside the state of New Mexico. Having recently returned from New Mexico I think his new Mexican dishes may even be better than the ones in New Mexico he has combined the best of every restaurant in New Mexico  the best posole was at the frontier restaurant his equals that, there is not a breakfast burrito in New Mexico that compares to his, And he has specials that could not be touched even in New Mexico.
