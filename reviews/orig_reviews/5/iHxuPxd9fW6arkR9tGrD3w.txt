Great place to get some of the best authentic Mexican food! Their complimentary chips and salsa get dropped almost as soon as you get seated. The service can be hit or miss but most of the time very friendly, fast, and ready to help you. Their two entree combo with rice and beans is perfect. I always get a beef empanada and switch up the second choice each visit. Never had a problem with the food, except of course feeling too full to move. Their house Margarita is pretty good and sometimes the bartender has a heavy hand. Overall great food, experience, atmosphere and VERY reasonably priced. Highly recommend.
