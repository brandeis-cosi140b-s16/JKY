EXCELLENT!!! Loved the prickly pear cactus margarita. The guac is the best I've ever had. You can just make a meal of that awesome guac. The fried chiles appy is the bomb, too, but seriously watch out for the ghost chille sitting atop the pile of green chiles. It will floor you before you know it. It almost took out my brother who pops habaneros like olives. Saved by an emergency glass of milk... I plan to go back to further explore the menu, but this is a great place at night, sitting out on the ambiently-lit patio. Nice place to just snack, and drink, and chill. Great service, btw.
