I had heard good things about this place so my friend Jen and I decided to stop in during Happy Hour and give it a try.

I've seen some people comment on the lines and ordering. Now, when we were there, it wasn't too crazy so ordering was easy, but I could see how if there were a lot of people it would get confusing and nuts. Luckily, we didn't experience that.

We took advantage of the happy hour menu and had the three carnitas tacos and the chicken nachos, both of which were only $5 each! What a great value.

Not only was the food fantastic and yummy, they also have a salsa bar with all kinds of goodies, like black and pinto beans and the really good creamy green sauce. Everything on the salsa bar is included if you buy food so you could literally eat your weight in beans if you wanted. I weigh a little too much for that, but either way, it's worth mentioning.

I added a soda and Jen had water...bringing our grand total to $13.50 for a really good and filling dinner for two!

Note that the Chicken Nachos came with all the good stuff, like Guac and Sour Cream and Pico! SOOOO GOOOOOOD!! Also, the carnitas taco have a little kick to them, but overall the flavor was pretty dang good!!

I will certainly be back.
