Great Happy Hour Menu and wonderful staff and service.  The Happy Hour Menu now takes place from 4pm to 6pm.  Go with a couple of friends so you can share all the good food and drinks.  The La Hacienda and Prickley pear margaritas are really good.  If you are willing to try something new other than your normal Tequila ask for Danielle, the Tequila Goddess, she is a wealth of knowledge and she will definitely guide you in the right direction.  Try the Don Julio 1942 tequila, its a sipper not straight shot so enjoy yourself.
