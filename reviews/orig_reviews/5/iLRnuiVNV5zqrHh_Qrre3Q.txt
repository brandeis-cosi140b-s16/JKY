If you love tacos, this is your place.  If you like beer you will like this place even more.  I stopped in here twice during my trip to vegas for the week.  They have some amazing taco combinations and you buy them individually, so you are not stuck with a plate of food you only wanted half of. 

They also had a great beer selection, most I had not heard of.  They are happy to offer suggestions and give you samples until you find something you like.  All of the staff here was great and the bill was small even with all the food and beer.
