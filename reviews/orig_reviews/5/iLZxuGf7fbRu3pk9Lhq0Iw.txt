Really great experience, the food was awesome and I loved the staff. I was bummed it was jammin' busy for how awesome i thought it was so, GO CHECK IT OUT! I live to far away to go there regularly but I would go all of the time if they had one in North Phoenix. The manager was extra cool and made sure we were good at all times. When I go to the eastside it will be my go to Mexican Grill!
