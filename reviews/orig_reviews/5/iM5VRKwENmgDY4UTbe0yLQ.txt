Dont judge a book by its cover. This place is great. Good quality, great value, and is easy in and out. It does take a little while compared to the fast food alternative but its worth it.
Had the carne asada fries. The portion was huge! I am no small man and I had plenty left over for a snack later. Quality is unreal. Well worth the trip.
