Yum!  I can't wait for another trip from Chicago to Scottsdale to visit this place.  I was here visiting to cheer on OK state for the fiesta bowl.  This place had great reviews so I gave it a try.  The service was very good considering the place was packed (with orange).  Our waiter had excellent recommendations and all 5 in our party were satisfied with the food. I ordered the stacked enchiladas with the carne adovada.  It was great!  All the chips/salsa and the dips were good too.  If you like trying new things and have a refined palate you should stop by this place.
