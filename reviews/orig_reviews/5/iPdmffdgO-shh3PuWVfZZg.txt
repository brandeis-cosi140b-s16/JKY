Gourmet tacos!  Try any two gourmet tacos you will not be disappointed. These tacos aren't your regular small street tacos these are some serious tacos. I tried the la santisma taco with arrachera carne and the shark taco. Both were incredible. Really like the shark taco with its sauce.  And the santisma taco was right on. Real Mexican sodas with real sugar straight from the glass bottle. And don't forget the salsa bar. Seriously, so many salsas to choose from. Try them all, I did and simply went back for those I liked, no loved!  Oh. Did I forget even the rice and beans were good and I only know this because they mistakenly added them to my plate, the chef was being generous the waiter said. Thank you I said!  These are definitely better the average rice and beans.
