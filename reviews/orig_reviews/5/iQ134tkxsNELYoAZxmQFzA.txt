The patio is the best this time of year. I love the happy hour specials. My favorite are the spicy crab cakes with a refreshing margarita. The weather is just perfect to sit outside for lunch and the waterfall is relaxing. Can't wait for the 20th anniversary on November 22. I heard drinks and food for a penny for lunch. You can guess where I will be!!!  Great service. Great drinks. Good prices. Local owned, New Mexican cuisine. What more can you ask for?
