This is a great place for satisfying your Mexican food cravings.  Chips and salsa were great!  Love the house special chimi was awesome!  It is enough for 2. The slow roasted pork and variety of sauced made it fun to eat! The 3 Amigos platter was great as we sampled a taco enchilada and tamale. Best part of all; the manager allowed our entertainment discount without a coupon!  We will be back!
