Great steak salad, didnt like the weird hard tortilla thing it came on but skipped it and enjoyed the rest. The salsa was really tasty, smoky and yummy! The skinny margarita was so delicious, I loved that they had a skinny cocktail option. We went here in a group for a tradeshow and everyone seemed to enjoy their meal!
