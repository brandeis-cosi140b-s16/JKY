Born and raised in houston, tx to having to move to ft. Knox, KY. I had to be in ft. Mccoy, wi for a training event. Me and my partner were craving mexican food and decided since we were in the area of madison why not stop here. I must say this place hands down brought me back to my mexican roots. I have been craving some legit mexican food that not even kentucky can satisfy and this restaurant was just hands down the best. We had the enchiladas de mole one of chicken and the other of cheese and it was delicious. Reminded me of being back at my families in mexico. I was even surprised that they sold posole and menudo! Not that many mexican restaurants in Texas do that! When this restaurant says authentic mexican food they mean it. Even the restaurant reminded me of the ones in mexico. we really enjoyed ourselves and next year I will definitely be back for more!!!
