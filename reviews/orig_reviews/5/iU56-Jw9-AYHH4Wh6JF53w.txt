Do you like freshly prepped food mixed with authenticity? If you answered yes, then you're sure to love Cheryl and Ricks' approach. Everything this great couple cooks up is done exactly like that, and who knows, you may even run into a new dish. While she has a menu you may very well fall in love with a one of a kind treat she's conjured up for you. Is it hot? Yep, but that's the way it should be right? If you don't enjoy the spicier side of the dish just ask, and she'll make sure you leave with a great taste in your mouth.
