No complaints here. Server was awesome. Chips and salsa were delish and the main dish was yummy. Nice thing is their portions run normal. I was able to finish my meal and feel full but not overwhelming stuffed. Great drink options especially if you like tequila/margaritas. Decor is awesome. Interior designer did an incredible job. Relax while enjoying a great meal. (I had dinner at STK and this place kicks it's butt). Enjoy!
