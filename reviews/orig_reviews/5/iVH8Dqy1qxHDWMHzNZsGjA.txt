Went early on a Saturday night. They were short-staffed, but the service was still great. I ordered the beef taco and chicken enchilada combination. The enchilada was great and the beef taco was fantastic. The beef was very flavorful and cooked perfectly. Slightly crispy and super tender and juicy without being greasy. The food was excellent and the service was fast and friendly. Decent prices, you're not going to find sit down Mexican food for much less. I can't recommend this place enough.
