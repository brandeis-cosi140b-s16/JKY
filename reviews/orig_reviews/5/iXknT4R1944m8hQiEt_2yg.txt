I'm surprised I forgot to updates this review, as much as I love it here.  My favorite entree is still the Naco Torta, with an egg lightly fried over beef, with a pico de gallo sauce and thin slices of avocado on their fluffy white bun - messy, but a delicious sandwich.  i've not had a single item on the menu let me down - the guac is amazing, the corn to die for, the chips crispy, hearty, and not too salty, and the salsas are almost enough to keep me dipping in their bowls instead of eating the guacamole.  
a note - they raised the prices on the beef and fish tacos by fifty cents.  still a great place to eat.
