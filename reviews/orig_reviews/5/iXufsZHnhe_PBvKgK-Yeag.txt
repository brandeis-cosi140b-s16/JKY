I found myself walking by this place late at night on the way back to my hotel and decided to give it a shot.

Simply delicious.  Great place for a casual meal while in Vegas.

Only very minor drawback is that the seating area is a bit on the warm side (it's July), but the tacos were so good I scarfed them in just a few minutes anyway.
