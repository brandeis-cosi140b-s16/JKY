This place is legit. It is NOT a Filibertos or anything like it. While I'm ok with those joints, this place is two notches higher.. Great fish tacos. Great carne asada. Beans are good and authentic. Salsa is good, but could use one with more heat. Service is very good. Place is clean and a good ambiance for a hole I. The wall taco shop. Bottom line, one of the best authentic joints around!!!
