This is my favorite Mexican restaurant in the Phoenix area.  They have really good food at a really good price.  I go to the one at 21st street & Cactus, which is pretty new.  Also, the one at 12th Street and Mohave, which is very old.  The food at both seems to taste the same, but I love the downtown location because it is a real dive = lots of character.
