We were looking for a casual meal after seeing a movie at the South Point Hotel. Baja Miguel seem to fit the bill. This was rodeo week in Vegas and the South Point was absolutely jammed at every corner. We went upstairs to see if they would be able to get a party of four in in a reasonable amount of time. The hostess told us it would be about 10 minutes. We decided to wait for the table. About five minutes our beeper was going off and we were seated. Almost immediately, one of our servers brought a basket of chips with three dipping sauces: guacamole, salsa and refried beans. The salsa was very tasty but a little spicier than I cared for. The guacamole and the beans were absolutely delicious. My wife and I decided to share an order of  chicken fajitas. Because we were sharing the server brought us an extra potion of tortillas at no charge. The sizzling platter was filled with chicken, sauteed onions, and sliced peppers. They also had sides of sour cream, guacamole, beans, and rice. The flour tortillas with fresh and incredibly tasty. Overall it made for a absolutely terrific meal. One of the best the fajitas I've had in a long time. And the portion was more than enough to share. The price was ridiculously reasonable. I will be back here again after a movie in the near future.
