5 stars. This place is super yummy.

To start, we had the chips and guac with pineapple. A really good combination. Super fresh. 

I got the pork adovado taco and a coffee braised beef taco. Incredible. I'm pretty sure you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. 

Also ordered the sangria and it was a bit strong but really refreshing. 

Love this place. The decor is awesome and low key vibe. Highly recommend.
