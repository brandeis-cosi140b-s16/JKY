I am so happy that America's has found such great success!  Simple Mission accomplished: Amazing food.   Love me some Bean & Cheese burrito. (tip: ask for it Terry's style...they add raw white onion and hot sauce).  Their vampiros are delicious of course....but the show stopper is the Carne Asada Torta.  As a native arizonan...I am assuring you, this is the best.  

They offer a free Chips & Trio if you sign up for their loyalty club...and don't forget to follow them on Facebook!  it's always nice to have a reminder when their happy hours are, half of taco days and $2 coronas ! :)
