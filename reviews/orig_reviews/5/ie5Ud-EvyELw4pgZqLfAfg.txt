Juans' flaming fajitas and cantina was as good as advertised. The service was excellent everyone that worked there was super polite and made sure we felt right at home. Most important of all the food was hot and fresh. I had the steak Picado and I must say it was very tasty the steak was cooked just as I asked and was very juicy not dry at all! My wife had the chicken floutas and she loved it. My grandma had the cheese enchilada and tamale combo plate and everything was fresh as can be. we noticed a lot of people ordered the flaming fajitas. My friend ordered the steak  fajitas for one and he said it ranked up there with some of the best he ever had.I can't stress how fresh the food was we were all very impressed and will definitely be coming back again soon!
