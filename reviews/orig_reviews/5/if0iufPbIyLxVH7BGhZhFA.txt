There's Mexian food.  Then there's Mexican food.  Arribas is the best around.  Been to ALL the other places, and hands down this is the best.  Last night must have been the umpteenth time for dinner.  Had my new favorite, Green Chile Machaca Tamale.  The portion is very large and comes with two tamales.  I usually order a side of beans to go because I always have the second tamale to take home.  Plenty of chips and great salsa- hot or mild with bean dip.  They're not kidding when they tell you the hatch chiles make it hot.  Because the chiles are extremely hot - be careful if you don't like it that way.  I just have them hold the chiles or put them on the side depending on what I order.  The staff is very friendly and they remember you each time you come in.  There's hardly ever a wait because the place is so big.  If there is a wait, it's not for very long.  Did I mention great  Margaritas too!  Even their 99 cent margaritas are great, I forget what day they offer them at that price.  But if you're there when they do, don't miss out.

This place makes great Mexican food.  More importantly, their food and service is always consistent.  I've never had a bad meal here.  The building is nostalgic.  It's been there for a very long time.  It was once "Tony Romos a place for Ribs" and before that is was a fun place called "Googs".    The upscale version and night dinner spot for Guggy's Grill, which was kinda like a better Denny's or Brookshires if you remember that place.  Now I'm dating myself.  We're talking ancient history here.  This place has seen a lot of people in and out of it's doors.  I'm sure everyone in Phoenix has been there in the building one time or another.  If you have or if you haven't now you can have Mexican food there.  Go, It's great!
