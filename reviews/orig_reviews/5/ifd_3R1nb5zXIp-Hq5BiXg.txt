On a recent trip in March, I dined at LH twice as I was staying at the Fairmont hotel. I had seen Richard Sandavol the day before on a morning show out of NYC and thought what a great opportunity for me to try one of his restaurants. So on the first night, I walked in and was politely seated in the lounge as I didn't have reservations. Long story short. Courteous and knowledgeable service, excellent food and comfortable atmosphere. Guacamole is made at the table, excellent fish and short ribs, lobster tacos and a killer layer cake with flan in one if the layers. On April 26, I was in Scottsdale again this time with my ultra foodie wife. We had reservations, but the lounge was such a cool place to dine, we stayed in the bar at a table next to the window. Best seat in the house. Back to the wife. She calls food at LH fresh, clean flavors, original creations combining Mexican and Asian!, and delicious.  Don't forget to have a margarita.
