Words cannot describe this food.  It is a true delight to dine here.  Authentic upscale Mexican food.  You will not find chips and salsa here.  You will find amazing shrimp dishes, an array of freshly prepared salsas and watermelon juice.  Cozy, colorful, and wonderfully unique.  Lunch is a total bargain.  Dining is a little pricey but totally worth it.
