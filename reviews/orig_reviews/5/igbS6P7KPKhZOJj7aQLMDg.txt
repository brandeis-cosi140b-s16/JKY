Best taco / burrito shop in the area. The food is great and you get a lot of it. They have a lot of different meat flavors to choose from and if you aren't sure what all the flavors are they will let you sample them to see what you like. I like to get an order of five street tacos and get different flavored meat in each taco. Be warned if they say it's spicy then they mean it!
