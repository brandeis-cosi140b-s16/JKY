I love anything FREE but stds!! And we came here on a Friday night around 10ish and we walked right to the top no cover and then they had a live band play a couple new popular songs and some classics. It was freaking great!! A good change from the upscale snobby club scene Vegas has to offer. I'm coming back to this joint!!
