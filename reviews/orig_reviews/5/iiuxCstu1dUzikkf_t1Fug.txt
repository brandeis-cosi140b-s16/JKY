Here is my recommendation, try anything here (it's ALL GOOD!).  However my favorite is brunch here.  You must try a Bloody Mary...they make them with NM Red Chile instead of Tabasco...it's delish.  Foodwise, I recommend the Enchiladas & Eggs...add green Chile, chicken and you have a feast suitable for the Gods.  This is definitely a splurge spot, but it's my favorite.  I have had probably over 50% of the menu and all is good.  This place is tiny...so it can be tough to grab a seat, but well worth the wait if you have your heart set on some Amazing NM food!

Plus, let's care it...with enough Bloody Mary's EVERYTHING tastes awesome!
