After a miserable experience the night before at Pizzeria Bianco, my wife and I decided to stop into Barrio Cafe and snagged a table about 30 seconds before the dinner crowd arrived.

Best spur of the moment dining decision I've ever made! Having grown up in southern California and living in Arizona I have a special fondness for Mexican cuisine, and I can honestly say Barrio gave me the best example of how you can do modern gourmet cuisine and retain classic Mexican styles.

First off the Quesadilla de langosta borracha made me reconsider what it means to be a quesadilla, and in a good way!

The Chile Relleno was amazing, open faced and covered in amazing cheeses, scallops and shrimp and accompanied by perfectly roasted squash and onions. Heavenly!

To wash that down with a properly made Michelada Picocito was just icing on the cake.

Speaking of cake, try the churros, they basically ruined zoos and fairs for me from now on because no $6 carnival churro will ever compare!

Now I just have to return 10 more times to try everything else on the menu that looked amazingly good! Comida Chingona is right!
