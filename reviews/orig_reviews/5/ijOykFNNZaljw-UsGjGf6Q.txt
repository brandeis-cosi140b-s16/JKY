This review is for the night life experience only:

Continuing on the bachelorette conquest, we literally stumbled upon this place in the wee hours of the morning. It was sweet that there was no cover for ladies or locals, which got our entire group in for free. As we entered, super hot, lingerie wearing bartenders were dancing and swinging from on top of the bar. One of the bartenders immediately grabbed our group, tilted our heads back, and then began to pour shots in our mouths. With that kind of service I immediately tipped her. The crowd ranged from people in their 20's and 30's. We were totally feeling the music, because it was a good selection of EDM and hip hop. Great being girls in Vegas because the whole night's worth of drinks will be paid for you. Overall, great atmosphere, good company, and epic times.
