We have been to the Spotted Donkey near the Bouldrs many times and every time the total experience was woderful, especially the consistantly great food.  On the other hand we have been to the new Spotted Donkey on Hayden 3 times and all three times the food was practically inedible. 
The food is consistantly dry, tastless and usually arrives at the table cold. 
It is a beautiful restaurant but I would highly reccomend avoiding the new one on Hayden.
