Went on opening day, had a delicious cocktail and a wonderful entree. Gorgeous day sitting outside in the sun under umbrella in comfortable chairs next to a lovely fountain, you can bring your dogs too! Excellent service, ambience and value. Too bad I don't live closer, but I will be a regular as much as possible. Nice inside, nice outside. Very classy looking.
