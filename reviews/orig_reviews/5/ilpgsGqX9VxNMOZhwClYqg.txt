I've been going to the El Ranchero since 2008.  Quaint place, much bigger than it seems from the outside.  One of my first criteria for picking a restaurant is NOT being part of a chain.  I much prefer local joints, and this is one of the better ones.

From what I can tell, the food is pretty traditional.  Though I am more a fan of Tex-Mex.   They do a good job of accommodating me serving most things Enchilada Style.  My favorites are the Hornitos - bacon wrapped Bannana (Yellow Wax) chiles, stuffed with shrimp... And the Chile Relleno.  I usually order both and make a meal of it.  Good service, and the bean dip/salsa are very good.
