I absolutely love this place. It may be next to a strip club, but once you're inside, you completely forget about the location. The decor is very classy and feels higher end.

If you love spicy things, ask for the habanero salsa with the chips. It has a kick, but so good. The table side guac is also totally worth it. 

I would go back just for chips, dip and drinks, but the place is always packed so make it an evening with a full dinner!
