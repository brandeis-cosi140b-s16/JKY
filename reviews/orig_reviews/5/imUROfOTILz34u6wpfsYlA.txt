I was going between a four and a five until I remembered the grilled ear of corn covered in cotija cheese and smoked paprika i ate just 30 minutes ago... and got all woozy again...then the '5' won out! The cochinita and carne asada tacos were also delicious.  The citrus marinade on the carne asada makes for tasty meat I mus' say!  The bean, also with cotija cheese, were solid and lumpy with whole and partial beans, just the way I like my beans.  Can't stand those put thru a blender or food processor or something to remove any need for teeth to eat them.  If I could just have gotten a nice cold tangy jamaica (hibiscus flower) drink, I would have just floated out of the place a few minutes ago on a cloud.. As it was, the buck 25 Americano was a nice end to things.. Get some friends, get some money and go  now!
