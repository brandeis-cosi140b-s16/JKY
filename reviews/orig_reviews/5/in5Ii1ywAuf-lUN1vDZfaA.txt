YES! I been going to Wahoos in SO CAL for over 15 years. When I moved to Vegas I really started missing Wahoos. NO MORE! Wahoos is in Vegas as of Oct 2011. The food is just as great as SO CAL. Service is excellent. Go see Nikki in the bar. Very friendly.  But what is better about  the Vegas location is a 24/7 full menu and bar.  That's right...coming in on a red-eye to Vegas? Hop on over to Wahoos at 3:00am for a fix. About 15 min drive from the Airport.  215W @ Rainbow. Just North of  215 @ Sunset. I'm coming back tomorrow...LOL
