I love this place. It's right in between the fine dining of Mission and Loco Patron. 

We ordered the guacamole, bbq tacos, chicken lime bowl and salmon bowl. Each had its own unique flavorful taste. We were satisfied with every one. I don't think you go wrong with ordering food from here!

It paired nicely with a michilada, which was made well and not poorly like most bar. There was crushed salt on the rim, real tomato juice and a big juicy lime. 

Everything came out fast, the waitress was prompt with refilling our waters and taking good care of us. We even got a deal for checking in on yelp! A taco and beer combo for $5!

We will be back because it's a great little lunch spot.
