I call this place, Little Mexico to my friends and coworkers because it is so authentic.  I've been going there for about a year, mostly because its less than a mile from my work and on my way home.  I've never been disappointed either.  I brought some carne asada tacos and a bowl of beans back from work with me and now all my coworkers are addicted.
We even did an event with 15 people, so I stopped by the day prior to ask how to handle it.  Just had to call in order early and it was all ready and organized on time.  Great service!
It can be a long wait for your order if they are busy, so just fyi.  Salsa is very spicy, very flavorful!  Great stuff all around.  They now have horchata too.  Haven't tried it yet though.
