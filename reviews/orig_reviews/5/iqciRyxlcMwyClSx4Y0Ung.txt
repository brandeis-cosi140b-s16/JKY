Aside from the normal hike from the parking lot to the restaurant this is a GREAT Mexican restaurant ~
   Located deep inside the Aria~ well worth the walk. This location is as good as the Newport location without the ocean view 
   Drinks are pricy starting @ $16, that's normal for the Strip, they are not light pours either~ great interiors and lighting in main restaurant and the bar area has a very cool lounge area too!
