I came here for lunch on Mother's Day with my daughter.  The service was wonderful.  The waitress was very friendly and we didn't have to wait very long to put our order in or for our food which is always a good thing when dining with a 7 year old.  The food was delicious and they were able to accommodate our dietary needs (gluten free).
