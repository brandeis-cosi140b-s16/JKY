We weren't sure about going here because it looked small and dark, but decided to walk inside and check it out. It was pretty big inside and the atmosphere was fun and fantastic. Our waiter looked like Pancho Villa and was great. The margarita was delicious. The food was great. We ordered the Asada salad and the Asada plate. Service here is fast and professional. We will be coming back again.
