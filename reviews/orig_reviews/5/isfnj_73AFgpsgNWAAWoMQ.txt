First time dining here and the food is awesome. The fajitas are to die for and the chicken chimichangas are amazing. Definitely get the red sauce and the mashed potatoes, you can't go wrong with. Lizette was our server and she was outstanding. She kept coming back to check on us, gave us great recommendations!! Definitely would come back and having lizette was a bonus.
