For the reader, please be aware that there are the "corporate" Garcia's which is BLAH!, and then there's this place, The Original Garcia's, which is AWESOME!

I've been coming to this place almost 25 years, and I've tried most of the items on the menu over the years.  I've never had a bad meal, and in fact I use the original Garcia's as my gold standard for other Mexican food. 

This place has both the main restaurant, and a separate  take out/drive thru/sit down building.  If you want a more formal setting, go tot he main restaurant, but if you want a quick sit down place, or get the food to go, you have that option.  Personally, I go through the take out most of the time, because its all the same food, which is all the same level of AWESOME!   

Go there, and your tummy will thank you for it!
