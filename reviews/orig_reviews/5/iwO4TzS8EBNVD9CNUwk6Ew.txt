This is the only restaurant in Las Vegas where I can go and know that my food is going to be complete perfection for under 10 bucks! I have been everywhere and tried over 300 different restaurants in the united states and this is my personal favorite restaurant. The setup is simple and the food is downright fantastic! If i were to invest money in a growing restaurant that would go national it would be this one. The chicken is tender and juicy, the steak is marinated in an amazing sauce that makes the meat melt in your mouth, and the fish is pan fried to a nice caramel brown and flakes amazingly. The shells are nothing like anywhere else I have eaten tacos they too have a awesome flaky crunch about them. also this company makes awesome sauces that you can buy and go great on salads and other food you want to taste good. if you have not gotten over here you haven't tasted the wonder that this place will bring into your life! 

oh p.s. the coconut bark will make you wish you never bought it, its probably the best bark I have had ever as well.
