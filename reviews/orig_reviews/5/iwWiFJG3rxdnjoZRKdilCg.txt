La Comida was highly recommended by friends who know Las Vegas well. It was every bit as good as they promised. 
We had a very good lunch at La Comida today. Our group of six had a leisurely meal. The chips were warm, crisp, and fresh. The guacamole ($8) was delicious. The grilled fish tacos ($12) were excellent! The Chicken Enchilada ($14) was just the right level of spicy. The Beef Fajita ($17) was very good, too. We also had an Ensalada Organica ($10). All the servings were generous. Beans and rice were served separately on two large platters so that our individual plates were not crowded and heaped with food. 

Our waiter Frank was efficient and friendly.  He made us feel very welcome. The noise level was low. La Comida was one of the best Mexican Restaurants we have experienced.
