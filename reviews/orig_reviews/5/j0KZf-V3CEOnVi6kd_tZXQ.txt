If you can make it here for the happy hour -- you win. You get their AMAZING guacamole for $5 and you can snag some tacos for less than $2. 

I'm a veggie and I LOVE their vegetarian tacos, stuffed with seasonal vegetables: mushrooms, peppers, tomatoes, avocado. So good. During happy hour those babies are like $1.50 each..  they're small, so order 2-3.  My meat-eating friends are always satisfied. Gallo Blanco can get pretty packed after 4pm, so be prepared. Their agua frescas are SO delicious... and I've tried their version of the Moscow Mule (the Russe) and was not too impressed. I come for the tacos, not the cocktails.
