You won't get better tasting or higher quality Mexican food! The Pork is my favorite flavored pork in the world. Similar to Chipotle with the big burrito size and you coach them along in making it but the end result is that the taste of Cafe Rio blows anywhere else out of the water.
Also, got a burrito to take home to San Diego and the guy made it special, all separated to keep the ingredients tasting the best. Just ate it tonight and was just as good as same day in the restaurant.
Seriously, get the pork. For all you degenerates who go to Vegas for every reason under the sun with eating last on the list of things to do, highly consider adding a stop into Cafe Rio for your one meal of the trip.
Thanks Cafe Rio, you are delicious.
