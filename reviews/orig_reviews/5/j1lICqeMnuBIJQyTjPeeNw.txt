If you want an authentic handcrafted tamale this is the place to go.  Being a Mexican American I feel I am somewhat of an expert when it come to these things.  These are just like the one's my mother and grandmother used to make (They have since passed on, but not before handing down these generations old recipes to me and my female family members), the only difference is they did not shred their meat, they made bite size pieces.  I go buy these when I am lazy (because they are labor intensive to make).
