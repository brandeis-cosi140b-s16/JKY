I had horchata, beef tongue taco and pork stomach gordita for $7.4! the price is just amazing. And this is the only place in Madison I know where I can have pork stomach or beef tongue, they are yummy! the horchata is a little too sweet, and the waitress seems not very friendly to Asian, but I'll come back here later, for food!
