This place was awesome! I visit Vegas quite a bit and usually eat along the strip but decided to try a local place. It was a good choice. Food was delicious and very big portions for the cost. Staff was beyond friendly and the service was great. My cup never reached empty before the waiter was there refilling it. Oh and since it was my birthday they sang to me and I got some churros and a free shot! I will definitely go back!
