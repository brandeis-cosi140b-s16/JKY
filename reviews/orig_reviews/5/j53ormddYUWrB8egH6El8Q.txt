Saw the Mariscos Playa Hermosa menu photo layout in the Phoenix Mexican Food Guide (Mexican Seafood) section and we had to try it. It's almost 30 miles one way and I would do the drive a couple times a week for the food, service and friendliness We were taken care of from the time we entered right up to leaving. The "on the house" appetizers are are excellent. I like the red and my wife liked the green so much she had it put in our take home. We shared the Molcajete Catiente Mix and had enough take home for a late dinner. My beans and rice were the first empty plate and I know I had two loaded plates from the bubbling Mix bowl. The Mix sauce was so good I put it on my rice and could have made a meal from just that and the beans. I had a little trouble getting Yelp to come up,on my cell, but they had already taken our order for the complimentary "Yelp  cake". If you haven't tried a Tres Leche Cake you will want to make sure and order a slice here. My wife's chocolate cake was top notch too.  If you haven't read the Phoenix Mexican Food Guide (Mexican Seafood) article you want know how to get the cake. Here's a link to the restaurant: http://mariscosplayahermosa.com/reviews.htm
