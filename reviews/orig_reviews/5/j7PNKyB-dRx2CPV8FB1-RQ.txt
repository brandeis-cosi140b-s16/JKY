I live how simple and casual this place is. It is really easy taking our kids there, and the food is delicious! The service is always fast and they have the best Pepsi I swear. I don't know how they make it taste so good?!? This is a great place to go when you are short on time as the service is always great and you get served quickly. I personally love their steak tacos. I'm never usually a fan of rice at Mexican restaurants but theirs is by far my favorite. They have a salsa bar where you can help your self to your liking. The prices are great too. They have a good bar area and nice outdoor seating as well. It's nothing fancy, but it sure is good!
