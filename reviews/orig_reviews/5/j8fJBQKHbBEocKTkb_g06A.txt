I'll get straight to the point - by far the best Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas. I grew up in Vegas and after living in Canada for 6+ years, I began to really miss great Mexican food. There are many places around town that offer great Mexican food, but none like this one. They go beyond the food. The life music, overall vibe, and outstanding service is something you won't find in many other places. 

Favorite menu items are Queso Fundido with Chorizo, Tacos al Pastor, and Pollo al Pipian. My only negative mark would be on the desserts. Stay away from that flamed fried ice cream!
