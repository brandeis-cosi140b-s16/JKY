It's a nice place to eat and have drinks with friends or family.  I always order the ceviche and on Tequila Thirsday a flight of what's on special.  The food is good and prices aren't crazy so it's a pretty predictable place to eat. The manager has stopped by every time to ask how the food was and thank us for coming in which I appreciate.  The bad reviews seem all over the place sooooo, to break it down, It's definitely not On The Border but it's not La Hacienda, it sits somewhere in the middle closer to La Hacienda and I think most people will find it predictably good like myself and enjoy it.
