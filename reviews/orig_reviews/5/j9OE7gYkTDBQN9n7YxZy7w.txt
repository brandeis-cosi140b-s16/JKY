We celebrated a family birthday here.  

Richardson's staff made it as wonderful as twenty years of memories there could have aspired to.

The New Mexico platter was absolutely the epitome of New Mexican Cuisine.

Our native New Mexican was impressed with the adovada entree.

My chorizo pork chop was simply amazing.

Nothing in New Mexico was on this level of service and flavor.

All said another wonderful visit to Richardson's.
