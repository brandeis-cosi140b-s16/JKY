I have been to Wickenburg several times, but it's always tough to find a place to eat. Yesterday, my hubby and I ventured out from our campsite at Lake Pleasant and the Yelp reviews led us right to El Ranchero. Our server, Candy, was delightful. She gave us the backstory on her family and the history of the restaurant. 

The chips arrived with a trio of condiments. Two salsas and a bean dip. Totally delicious. I ordered the shrimp taco and a side of the bean dip, which Candy said was a little more smoky than the regular beans. My hubby ordered the hornitos, which are yellow waxed peppers stuffed with shrimp and queso fresco and wrapped in bacon. The food was heavenly and the service was excellent. Can't wait to return.
