Wow! I know it's been a minute since I've been on here, so you know it's gotta be something good, right??!!!

I went to Gallo and was COMPLETELY blown away with how great everything was! From service to food to prices( wow the prices!)  I got the Cheesburger, Carne Asada Beef Torta, and the Cochinita(pork) and fish tacos and loved each flavor of everything! The pork had a sweet bbq flavor which was a nice surprise, the french fries were  salty just like I love em, the burger was juicy and flavorfull, and the Carne was seasoned great and used a perfect amount of cilantro ( how I luv cilantro!!)!  I especially loved that the whole meal, which I shared ( I didn't eat all that people! LOL!), was only $22!!! That's cheaper than a Taco Bell or Armandos run!!

Needless to say I was craving it again last night after I tried it in the morning, but didn't go back, only giving myself one cheat meal! HA HA!!

But I'll be back, A LOT!!!
