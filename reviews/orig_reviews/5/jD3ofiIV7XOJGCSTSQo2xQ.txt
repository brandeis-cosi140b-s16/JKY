Mexican food our favorite. My husband and I have tried almost every Mexican restaurant in Vegas and this is our favorite. We eat here almost every Monday night. I get the chicken and beef fajitas and he gets the camarones chipotle con crema. Everyone is so friendly. The service is excellent! Try it for yourself!!
