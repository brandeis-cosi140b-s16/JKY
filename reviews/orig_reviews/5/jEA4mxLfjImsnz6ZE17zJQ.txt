Whoa! I didn't know this location existed! And it's closer to me :D
I already reviewed the other America's.
I love this place.
What a difference in staff. 
Although I have seen some people who work at both locations.

And for those of you that need to be corrected. It's not America's taco shop as in USA.
The owner's name is America.

As I mentioned on the other review. I'm hella picky when it comes to Mexican food since I am Hispanic.
Finally finally found a place that meets my high standards.
