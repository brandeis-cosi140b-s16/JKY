This was our second visit for this vacation trip. We found Komex a few years ago on Yelp and have gone back every time we visit Vegas. 
I tried the chicken fusion lettuce wraps with kimchi. Very good...I love the red hot sauce on the table. 
Can't wait to try the 2nd restaurant that will be opening later this year.
