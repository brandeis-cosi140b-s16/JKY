The wife and I were on vacation in Vegas for 5 days, we were getting tired of the same old casino food, and wanted a change. A friend recommended La Comida before we even left San Diego.
I asked the wife if she would like to try the restaurant, and off we went. That was the best damn food choice we made, we went back two more times before we came back to SD. Jonny was our bartender, very friendly and attentive to our drink needs. Every drink we ordered was made and mixed to perfection, I was impressed, and that is not easily done since I am in the food and drink industry.
 Now about the food, first time we ordered we played it safe, (we are a long way from home if you know what I mean) we had the carne asada salad and the carnitas tacos, lets just say "WOW!!!" the flavors were amazing and worked very well together' the meats were tender and moist and every bite was better then the last. about that time the manager (Rafael) came over to check on us, I said everything was awesome. he asked what we had and then suggested next time be more adventurous, and asked if next time we come in if he could order for us. I told him tomorrow he would have that opportunity. the next evening we were back, greeted by a very friendly hostess and Rafael, who asked if we like pork and chicken. We were seated in about 30 sec. drink orders taken, chips and salsa on the table. don't get me started on the chips... (3 bowls).  soon after that our food arrived, WTF??? I never got a menu, Rafael said he ordered for us. we had the Puerco Ahumado and Chicken Al Horno. This was truly Mexican food at it's best. I could not believe the flavors that these dishes had. Everything was above excellent, all the staff awesome, the chefs are amazing and talented. Thank you La Comida for being part of our awesome vacation. We will be back again and again.
