I'm shocked at the low number of stars Macayo's has thus far!  When I went to ASU and lived in Arizona I went to Macayo's all the time.  Whenever I travel there now I always make a stop, as they have the best Mexican food in Tempe.  

The venue is very large but it's organized well enough where you don't feel like you're in a swarm of people.  I've been to a few events there as well (in the back, outside area) and it's perfect if you want to be apart from the rest of the restaurant.

If you don't know what to order, just pick anything with the Baja sauce...it's amazing.

If you haven't been here on Cinco de Mayo, it's a must stop. They have events all day long and great drink specials.  

I can honestly say that this place consistently provides great service, amazing food and a fun atmosphere.
