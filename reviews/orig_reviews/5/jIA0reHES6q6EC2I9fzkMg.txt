Food was great and so was the service. Sylvia herself was working tonight and made sure everyone was greeted promptly and was taken care of. The servers-not just ours but all of them were friendly and stopped by our take multiple times to check to see if we needed anything. They had a live band playing and they were pretty good. This was the first time in many months that we had been here and the remodeling they had done is amazing. The decor is beautiful and they really improved the look of the restaurant. Over we had a wonderful experience.
