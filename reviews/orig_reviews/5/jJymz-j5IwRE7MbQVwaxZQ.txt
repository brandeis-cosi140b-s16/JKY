So many delicious choices, and so cheap! I love the system they have... order all your food from the cook, wait seconds while they prepare your taco at lightning speed, then pay at a different station. That's some Mexican efficiency right there.

My favorite, by far, was the lengua taco. The lengua was so tender and so very delicious. Can't go wrong with a whole tray full of lengua tacos and a jamaica to wash it down.
The suadero tacos was a bit on the dry side, so not that good. I also tried the pork stomach (I forget the name they had on the menu)... it was soft and tripey, if you like that kind of texture, but the flavor wasn't very strong.

4 to 5 tacos is enough for a whole meal, and with all the different meat choices, works well to give you a good variety. Next time, I'll definitely try the asada fries and the chorizo taco (the chorizo taco menu item is easy to miss).
