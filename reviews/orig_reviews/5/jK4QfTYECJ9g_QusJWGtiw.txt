Was down in AZ for the BCS National championship game, needed a place to eat dinner and Yelp didn't disappoint. Good atmosphere, great food, excellent service. At one point we had three people waiting on the two of us. One refreshing our chips and salsa, one toping off water and another delivering my margarita. Check this place out!
