Mexican food is one of my favorites so every time I get a chance to eat at a Mexican restaurant I have to try the chimichanga.  This is by far is the best one I have found and I've tried a lot of places!  They also have wonderful tasting enchiladas and tacos.  The food tastes super fresh and you can tell they take the time to prepare their food the right way!
