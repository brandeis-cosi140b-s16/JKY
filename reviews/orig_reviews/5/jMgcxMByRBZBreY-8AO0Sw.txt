Ok so I know there are some people hating on the Vida but I've been nothing but pleased during my visits there. I am totally digging that there is another option Uptown for Mexican besides the fast food Mexican places like Salsarita's and Qdoba. Some co-workers and I went for lunch today since one  had a free guacamole coupon and  were the first ones there. After 10 minutes of being there, the dining area was almost packed so obviously this place is doing something right.
We had prompt service with a friendly and knowledgeable server who gladly gave honest suggestions on what to order (seriously, request Matthew-he is wonderful!). 

The rolling guac cart came around right after we had our water filled and started to go to town on the fresh made guac. I love anything that I can see being made in front of me. Served along with that were some of the freshest and warm tortilla chips I've ever had with just the right touch of salt. And the guac? I almost asked guac man for his hand in marriage since it was rich, creamy and delightful. I wanted to scrape the bottom of the bowl but didn't think that would be ok since it was a business lunch and all. Our server suggested the carnitas tacos so I had to go with that and dare I say there were the best I've had (and I'm an Arizona transplant so I like to think I know good Mexican food). I had the plantain and black bean mash with was equally as awesome. We had no problems at all and checks were given in timely manner. I left with a feeling of happiness from exceptional service, amazing food and a food baby sitting in my belly. This place is one block away from my office which is going to be way dangerous for me but also way good for me.
