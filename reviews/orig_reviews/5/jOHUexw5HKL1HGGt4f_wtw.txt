I had my birthday dinner here last Thursday night.  It was amazing!  The food, the service, the timing.  Everything was perfect.  I had a party of 24 and this was the one restaurant (out of 15) that was happy to accommodate my party with an open menu, no service charge and no table minimum.  Thank you very much and of course we will be back!
