The atmosphere here is great, with well dressed people and friendly staff. I was there with my wife on a Friday night, and it was a bit busy. We went to enjoy the $2 tacos, and they were the best tacos that I've ever had, especially considering the price. They have a great menu, but if you're there for the $2 tacos they'll give you a separate menu, kinda like a notepad. One has the option of selecting various sides and toppings on his/her taco. This ranges from beans and rice to spicy tangy cream cheese. Whatever you select, I assure you it will be delicious!!!!!!!!!!
