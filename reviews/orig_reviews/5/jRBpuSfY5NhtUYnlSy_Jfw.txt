Every ingredient in Chef Paco's creations are deliciously distinguishable, yet perfectly synchronized. The pulled chicken in the burrito stands out only when you search for it - otherwise, it's busy sharing the stage with the cilantro rice, the fresh guacamole, the refried beans, and the perfectly griddled tortilla. The sizzling fajitas are beautifully balanced as well. The carne asada compliments the tasty veggies, and vice versa. Don't you dare leave without trying the flan! It's the perfect finisher, and it's sometimes brought out by Chef Paco himself. 

The organic, non-GMO, and cage free ingredients quell your guilt about buying into the agro-industrial trap of modern dining. 

The ambiance is incredibly cozy. The dim lighting, dark color palettes, and leather booths make your already amazing meal that much more enjoyable and intimate. The drinking glasses, as pointed out by our waiter, are hand blown. Huzzah!! Speaking of waiters, all of them are equally knowledgable about the menu and components of the entr√©es. Even at 3AM, their professionalism never falters.
