Ok... So if you had asked me what Dominican Street Food was a few months ago I would have stated confusingly back at you.  Well no more my friends!!!  This place is in a neighborhood adjacent to ours in Charlotte and has become our favorite place to ride our bikes to and enjoy.  Now remember this is billed as street food, so do not expect fancy... Just expect good.  From the tacos to the empanadas to our favorite Yucca Nelie, it's all extremely tasty and just plain fun.  The service is good, they have limited outside seating, a killer homemade salsa bar, awesome margaritas, and a big cooler of craft beers.  How can you go wrong?  If you haven't been yet and live in Charlotte you should get moving now!  Take care and eat up y'all!
