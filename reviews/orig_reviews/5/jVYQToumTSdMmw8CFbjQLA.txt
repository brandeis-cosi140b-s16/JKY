This was my first time to Tamales but my mom and grandma who are recent transplants via SoCal (and we know ggod mexican food) eat here on a weekly basis, after tonite I can see why. 

The carnitas are OUTSTANDING.. moist and flavorful, not tough at all. The tamales are possibly the best I have EVER tasted, order them enchilada style with any sauce you like, the green is fab but so is the red and ranchero. When you ask for sour cream you actually get true "crema" which was such a welcomed surprise. The margaritas also pack a punch, go for a pitcher, fab deal for $16. 

The dessert also doesnt dissapoint, the desert tamal is great, the flan is fab and the deep fried ice cream shows that you should only eat corflakes this way.

The service is friendly and fast but not rushing at all. They even brewed a fresh pot of coffee for my grandmother 15 minutes before closing.

This was my frist visit but surely not to be my last. 

Salute!
