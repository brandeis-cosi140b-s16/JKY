I'd prefer you not go so the line wouldn't be as long! Just kidding because this place is the real deal. Whatever you order will be authentic and delicious.  The tamales, Burros, tacos, enchilada's are legit!  No matter what you get, add a dozen of their homemade tortillas to be blown away. It's obviously great because every time I go, there are many other regulars waiting for their fix. If you call ahead, you will get to pick up your order at a separate counter and will get to skip the line.
