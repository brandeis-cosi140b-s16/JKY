Only complaint is the margaritas were a little sweet... Food and service more than made up for it. Hostess opened the door before we were even there. Eric was outstanding and made a dynamite table side guac. The home made tortillas were stellar and the habanero sauce hurt me in all the right ways. Very happy.
