I'm very picky when it comes to tortillas. Specially flour tortillas. I was born and raised in Northern Mexico, so I have plenty of experience when it comes to "authentic" flour tortillas. I can honestly say that Otro Cafe's are the best I've ever had in Phoenix (in 10 years of mostly disappointments). Everything I've had in this place has been delicious: tacos, paella, queso fundido, chilaquiles, and... THE FLAN! 
Service has been great and it's a nice atmosphere, will definitely come back many times!
