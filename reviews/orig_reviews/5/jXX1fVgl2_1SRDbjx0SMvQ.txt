This is my first review as a Yelper.. but before that Id like to say Ive recently moved back to the Valley and have been on a journey to find the best food Central Phoenix has to offer.. seeing as I live about a half mile from here I decided to give it a shot.. and boy did I hit a homerun for lunch!! For 8 bucks I took a carry-out Alambre Torta with fries.. this thing was loaded with Asada, bacon, onions, peppers and cheese.. and obviously mounds of avocado and a perfectly sliced tomato.. I was thouroughly impressed with this place and I will definitely be a returning customer who will end up trying every one on the menu.. Bravo Zulu!!!! Do yourself a favor and get ya some!!! The people are very nice and dont forget to hit up the salsa bar as the cashier will give you cups.. very very very very clean inside.. good job guys doing a craft that not only you are good at but is a delicious alternative to all that lame ass fast food out there..
