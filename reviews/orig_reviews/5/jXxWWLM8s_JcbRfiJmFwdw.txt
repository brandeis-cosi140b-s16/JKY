Been going there for over 20 years, when my sister comes back to town she has to stop. Always good, clean, sometimes very busy but worth the wait. The guys in my family and friends circle especially like the grilled chicken and meat. my vegetarian friends love their bean and rice. A plus, you support Local, they are local family owned and operated.
