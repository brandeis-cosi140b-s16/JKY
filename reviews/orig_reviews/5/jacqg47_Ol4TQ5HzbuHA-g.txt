I feel very lucky they opened this place near me. Not only is it cozy, but the food is very good. Love the taquiza cart they have out on Monday nites during the the summer. I hear they will be offer the taquiza cart for the "Movie In The Park" events this summer. They have good Sunday brunch deals and happy hour.  I believe they also have karaoke on Saturday nites.
