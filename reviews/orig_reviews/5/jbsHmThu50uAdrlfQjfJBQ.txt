Went there back in 2005 after reading the reviews on Citysearch before I left and couldn't pass up good Mexican food, even being from LA. My bf absolutely loved the place, especially the burros with chile verde and the chimichangas with red sauce. The tacos were great too. We sat outside and it took a while to get the food, but it was worth. I think it was the best meal I had while in that area. The only thing is that it's a little hard to find. I had a car with navigation, so it was a piece of cake, but it's tucked away in a neighborhood, so unless you're intentionally looking for it, you won't accidentally drive by it anytime.
