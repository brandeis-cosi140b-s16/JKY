For the tastiest food, most authentic atmosphere with amazing views, and stellar customer service, look no further.  A special thanks to manager Gerardo Lopez, who's attention to detail and gracious willingness to go above and beyond made this place a bookmark for me among the many dining establishments in the Valley.
