Very tasty food.  

I like to TASTE my food, not suffer for it, so if you want to know if it was spicy, not very. You can certainly have it be very spicy, but that is not my thing.

We went for an early dinner, so it wasn't crowded, but it did start to fill up by the time we left, mostly around the bar.

I had trio ground beef enchilada plate with rice and beans. The meat was good, no gristle and very flavorful without being greasy. There happened to be a photo of this in the menu, and for once it was an exact representation of what I got!  Overall it was a very tasty meal.  

The menu is large and varied for a Mexican place, and if you like Tequila you should come take a look at their liquor menu.

I would definitely go back.
