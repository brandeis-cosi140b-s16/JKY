I am always looking for a good place to take relatives from out of town. Somewhere that is only in Vegas and not a chain. My Cousin was visiting from out of town and we went here on a Friday for lunch. The parking lot was very full so I was worried there would be a long wait. We were greeted at the door and immediately seated. We were given chips, salsa and bean dip right away. They were nice and fresh. Our drink orders were taken and delivered and our food came out really fast! I had the lunch enchilada special. It was very tasty. The service and food were excellent! I will definitely come back!
