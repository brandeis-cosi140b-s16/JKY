This is the best Mexican food I have eaten in the valley and I've tried many restaurants in the past 6 years! 

I love, love, love their carne asada street tacos! Perfect flavoring and combination of cilantro, onions and sauce. The homemade tortillas, refried beans, carne asada quesadillas and pollo tacos are also delicious.

They offer a great happy hour with $1 pollo, carnitas and pastor street tacos along with $3 margaritas (very tasty), beer and wine.

The service is fantastic and there is a nice patio for when the weather actually cools down!

Try this restaurant if you like authentic Mexican food - by far the best I've had since my San Diego days!!!
