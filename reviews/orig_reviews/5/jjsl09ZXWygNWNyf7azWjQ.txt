When my boyfriend and I first heard about Joyride Taco House, we decided that the next time we had a taste for fresh Mexican, we were making it our destination - which is what we did last night.

When we walked in, we were seated right away. Iced water, chips & salsa were brought to our table immediately. We had a server and then some!  Throughout the night, all of the servers helped each another!! Every server that walked by our table either filled our water glasses, offered to get us a drink, picked up dishes, asked if there was anything we needed, etc.  At the sake of sounding like a cheesy cliche, the place ran like a well-oiled machine - but a personable, outgoing, happy well-oiled machine! I've never experienced anything like it, I was almost dumbfounded, but very pleased.  The way the servers - from bar staff to kitchen staff to floor staff - worked together, had a positive effect on the atmosphere of the whole restaurant. I would go back for that alone. But we were hungry and were anxious to try the food as well! 

Next in my review: The decor!  Retro! Bright and clean with very comfy chairs. The bathrooms are spacious, private and spotlessly clean. I laughed and told my boyfriend about not wanting to come back out into the restaurant because the ambiance of the bathroom made me want to stay in there and meditate. haha  

Before looking at the menu, we ordered drinks. I had a Classic Margarita, and after tasting a couple beers, my boyfriend had a small pitcher of beer. Their Happy Hour prices made us happy.  

Now, the food! The food was excellent, but of course, we could only eat so much, so we'll have to come back until we've tried it all!  I had the Veggie & Goat Cheese Enchilada. It came covered half in a green salsa sauce and half in a brown (mole-type) sauce.  The fresh veggies inside the Enchilada were chopped into bite sized pieces, and tasted delicious. The brown sauce was very spicy/hot for my taste. A server offered some Crème fraîche to tone down the heat, which definitely helped. (I would suggest that the menu states that the brown sauce is hot OR that the server states the fact, offering the option for only the green sauce.)  I loved the Enchilada and next time will have it with just the green sauce. My boyfriend had beef tamales that came with rice and beans - and not a drop was left on his plate. Everything from the chips & salsa, to our entrés tasted fresh and delicious.

From our first visit/experience, we were very impressed and will come back  to try other items on the menu - and/or Happy Hour appetizers and drinks at the bar. They do have an outdoor patio with misters, which we would be willing to try on summer nights.  

Good job, Owner & Manger!  

I wanted to leave this part out of the main review. If there is ONE thing I would offer as a possible change, it would  be this:  The servers are allowed casual dress, which I like, and adds to the casual, relaxed atmosphere of the place. I would only suggest that there be something that stands the servers apart from the customers - such as all black shirts  OR Hawaiian shirts OR something similar for the men - and maybe all black  or black & white attire for the women?    It really doesn't take long to figure out who the servers are - they are the ones who are constantly on the move and taking care of every customer in the place.  Keeping a casual dress style for the servers with some kind of consistent theme is only a suggestion.  We love Joyride Taco House and we will be back!
