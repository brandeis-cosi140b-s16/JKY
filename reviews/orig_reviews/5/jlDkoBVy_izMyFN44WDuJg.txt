I took my daughter and her friends to a concert last night in Charlotte.  After I dropped them off I searched Yelp for a Mexican Restaurant in the vicinity and found Azteca.  I was seated immediately in the restaurant and received a menu, my chips and saulsa and my drink order was taken.  

I ordered the Pollo Crema and guacamole.  Soon after I received my ice cold draught beer and a waiter came to my table and prepared the guacamole to order using a fresh avacado, onions, tomatoes and celantro. My only disappointment is I ordered a small portion instead of the large.  Moments later the entree was served on a huge dish full of rice and beans with my chicken.  The cream sauce was rich and eating it along with the guacamole was to die for.  

The server was exceptional too and he frequently checked to ensure the food was good, my beverage was full and chips were aplenty.  I have eaten Mexican food from coast to coast and this was by far the best I've ever had.
