Was at the Market for a business trip and decided to take it easy and have lunch here. At first glance it looked like the place was expensive, and probably not going to be worth it, i was PROVED WRONG when they had a decently priced happy hour. I believe we spent 60 bucks for three people and came out satisfied. The food had great flavor(calamari, beef sticks, nachos, tacos, etc etc)

I WILL eat here again when I'm back in town.
