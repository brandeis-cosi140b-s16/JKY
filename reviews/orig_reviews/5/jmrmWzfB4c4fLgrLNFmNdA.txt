KoMex is yummy and fresh. KoMex is cheap. They had great service when I went here. So in my book, KoMex is awesome :)

They're known for their tacos, which is what they recommend I try first. Your choice of Korean-style chicken, bulgogi beef, or spicy pork. With corn tortillas, $1.29. With flour tortillas, $1.99 each. 
They have some traditional Mexican and Korean dishes you can order, but I think the popular items were all on the left-side of the menu, basically Asian- style tacos, burritos, enchiladas, etc. 

I ordered three tacos, trying each meat. Delicious! I'm looking forward to going back :)
