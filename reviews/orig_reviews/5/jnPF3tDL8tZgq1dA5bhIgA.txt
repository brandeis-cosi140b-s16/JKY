From what I can tell, I don't think Dick's wants your business. With no sign out front and as hard as it is to find, you have to be in the know to give the aptly titled Hideaway a try.  But search for it you must, for it is truly one of the best breakfasts I have ever had the pleasure of consuming! 

I'm a huge fan of Mexican style breakfasts and the Huevos Rancheros are insane! Two eggs any style, served on a blue corn tortilla, smothered with green or red chile and cheese, served with potatoes and beans and it is enough for two people.  Just look at the pictures posted by the other Yelpers people.  You can tell just by looking at the photos that this place is going to be awesome.  Just go in and give this place a try already (if you can find it!).  How many more five star reviews do you need?!?
