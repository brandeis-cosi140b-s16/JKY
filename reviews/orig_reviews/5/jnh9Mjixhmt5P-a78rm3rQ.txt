I really like this place.  It's not traditional Senora Mexican food nor is it like any New Mexico fair I have previously had. It is delicious.  The have great options like the Chip Chop Salad I had with melt in your mouth pork or the double stack enchiladas with rice and beans my hubby had. The chips have a crispness that's hard to explain - they are neither to thick nor too thin. I loved them. The salsa they put on the table is very tasty and very spicy. They also have flatbread pizzas on the menu.

I also really like the atmosphere of this restaurant.  It's clean and welcoming.  I will be going back here very soon.
