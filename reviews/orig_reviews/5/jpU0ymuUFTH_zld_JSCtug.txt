Still my favorite Mexican food in the valley. They have unique family dishes that you will not find in any typical Mexican restaurant. If you are looking for the basic burrito, enchilada, or chimichanga...do not go here!!! If you are looking for traditional regional flavors done right by the family that owns the place, then do come here and you will have some great food. I have been a fan since the first time I went there and will continue to visit when I am in the area. For all of you nay-sayers....wake up and enjoy some traditional Mexican food and get rid of those Taco Bell mentalities! Los Sombreros knows how to cook god food!!!
