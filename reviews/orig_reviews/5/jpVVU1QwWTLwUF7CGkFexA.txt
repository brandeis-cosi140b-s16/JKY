I was VERY impressed with this place. It has the vibe I'm looking for, the drinks are strong and cheap, and you get quality food. The best dish was their pork shoulder. WOW! Their guacamole was off the hook! I'm a waitress, and I was impressed, so all around, I doubt you'll be disappointed. EAT HERE! Eat here for me if you're a local, because if I lived in the area, they would know me by name! NOM NOM NOM!
