This is my husband's and my all-time favorite Mexican restaurant. You have to like spicy salsa though because they only have spicy green and spicy red salsa. Both are good if you can stand the heat! The chips are good: thin and hot (although you might have a few greasy ones at the bottom of the basket). I've never had better green corn tamales or refried beans than I can get here. My husband likes the egg burro with green sauce all over it. Yum, yum, yum!!!
