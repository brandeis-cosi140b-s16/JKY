Two words: carne Asada. This place has the most delicious and cheap food ever. You get so much food with every meal, and it is all amazing. The carne Asada is by far my favorite thing that I've tried. I've heard everything else is good too I just can't bring myself to order anything else. Don't pass this place up!
