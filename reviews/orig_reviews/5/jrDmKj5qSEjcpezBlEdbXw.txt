Very good food here if you like Mexican-American food!   Salsa is amazing, especially since i judge my Mexican food restaurants based on the salsa and chips they serve and theirs was very fresh and flavorful. I ordered the chimichanga dinner with red chili and it was outstanding! Very authentic (taste just like home) and the portions/plate was more than I could handle in one sitting (definitely need a box to take remainder home).

My service from my waiter was outstanding and the place was packed for a Sunday evening too.  He was very attentive and provided quick and courteous service. BTW this was my second time eating here at this location and both times the service AND the food went above my expectations and this says a lot considering i just relocated from L.A. where there is a Mexican restaurant on just about every corner you look.

Sincerely,
Bookmarked for return
