Love Taco Tuesday, and Kids eat free on Wednesday.  On Tuesdays the mexican beers are cheaper too. There have been multiple weeks where our family has been busy and went two nights in a row. Can't beat the deals. 

Their salsa is also high caliber.  The hot stuff is the perfect heat.

I've been told by others that service is slow but I dont think its any different than any other place in the valley.  Taco Tuesdays are jam packed with people too, so be prepared...
