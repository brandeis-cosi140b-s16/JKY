Matta's has been a family favorite since My father was a young boy. We were sad when the original location closed in mesa on main street. Then they opened up a few years later at Mesa Riverview I have to say we are happy again this has been the most favorite place that my family loves to gather at. The food is excellent the staff are very friendly and some of them are the originals from the old place. I will certainly miss going with my father when ever we say Mattas he was ready to leave the house in less then 5 minutes. My father passed away in April but we will go on and always go to mattas in honor of him. BEST CHIPS AND SALSA EVER we can't eat there without eating at least 5 bowls of chips
