I will certainly return to The Mission. The service was the best I have seen from any other restaurant.  The hostess staff was very busy, yet made sure they were pleasant to everyone they greeted.  The waitress was very informative and seemed proud of the menu selection.   I can't wait to return, I will be telling everyone about this place.
