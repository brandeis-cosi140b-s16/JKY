Went here for the first time about a month ago. Hector was our bartender (husband and me = our). Order some drinks and we each got a chimichanga. Now, I am a southern bred Atlanta girl and can't handle spice but I am a curious cat when it comes to how a chimichangas can possibly be too spicy to eat. Based on reviews I was nervous. 

Salsa and chips arrived promptly as did the bartender. He was so friendly and answered all our questions while giving us some background on the place. Loved that. Drinks got there fast which I needed because salsa was a bit on the spicy side. Put our orders in and ordered some cocktails. Drinks were great and generous for the price.

Food got there right on time. And....amazing! It was spicy but it was so good that I finally understood what all these food experts do when they make orgasmic sounds after a good bite. I brought half home and heard it calling my name within minutes.  My mouth is watering from writing this review.

Yes, it is spicy...but the taste is worth the extra arm lifts for water. 

Bottom line...
Parking was great for a Friday night
Hector and service were awesome and 5 stars
Salsa was too hot...maybe serve a hot and mild? Chips were awesome by themselves!
Food is incredible and made me a believer.


Los dos...come to mama.
