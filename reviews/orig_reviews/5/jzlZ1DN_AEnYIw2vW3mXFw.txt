Seen this place on yelp and wanted to try something new in a new area since we barely came across downtown Gilbert today. (we are not from AZ) Cute little town area. We were greeted as we walked in, we sat outside in the open patio. The area they had for patio was cute with the hanging candles and lights.  Our waiter Clark, he was really nice and gave us great recommendations that we ended up trying. We ordered the Fila Ensalda (something like that) which is a really flavorful salad. I ordered the almond horchata with no booze, it was tasty. I also ordered the three tacos and get one side. The braised beef, shrimp , and Baja fish taco with the Mexican slaw as the side. 
It's not authentic Mexican food but it is all very good food. I love the edgy atmosphere.
