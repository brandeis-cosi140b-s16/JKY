My fave mexican place anywhere. Food typically very very good, they have a plantain and black bean mash that is to die for. When in Charlotte, i usually find myself here multiple times during my stay. Prices very reasonable. Agree  with one reviewer... not a fan of the chips, but the salsa is amazing. Isn't it always that way... can never got both :-)
