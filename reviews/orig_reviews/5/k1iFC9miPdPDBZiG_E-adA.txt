This place is the bomb! We've been twice and wouldn't hesitate to go back. The food always exceeds expectations and the patio has such a wonderful ambiance. Definitely recommend the guac and if you're vegetarian try the hibiscus enchiladas. They were so good and I haven't ever seen that dish anywhere else.
