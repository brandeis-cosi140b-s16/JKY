I travel to Madison frequently for work, and I was delighted to find a good Mexican restaurant that wasn't all about overly sweet margaritas or bland enchiladas.  I can say without any doubt that the food I ate here does not lack taste!  The atmosphere is modest but certainly not objectionable, and the service was just fine.  My companion and I ordered deep-fried jalape√±os, which were a surprise, and cactus salad, as appetizers.  Quite good.  I had a lovely pork dish in a tomatillo sauce--can't remember the name, but found the pork seasoned well and the sauce quite tasty.  

Our only complaint was that the prices were so low--my dining companion couldn't possibly meet her travel per diem that day!

OK, I would also have enjoyed a full-service bar, but the selection of Mexican beers was good.
