It's our second time here and we decided to try something new on their menu. Our waiter Dean recommended the shrimp fajitas, which were amazing, and my wife had the 3 chicken enchiladas which she said were amazing. The chicken tortilla soup is also very delicious.For an Americanized Mexican restaurant this place can compete with any authentic Mexican restaurant in Vegas. We most definitely will be back
