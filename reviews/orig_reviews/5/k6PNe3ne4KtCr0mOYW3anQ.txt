I cannot say enough about Carolina's. By far the best Mexican joint in town. It's nothing to write home about in terms of atmosphere, but that's part of the experience.

My favorite foods:
- Any burrito, enchilada style with red sauce. Like everyone says, the tortillas are absolutely the best anywhere and that red sauce cannot be beat.
- Chorizo anything.
- The chips and salsa. I always buy an extra bag of chips to take home and the salsa is phenomenal.
- Chocolate chimichangas. Small but oh so good.

Try this one or their location in North Phoenix. You will be beyond impressed.
