Such a fantastic Mexican themed place to relax, eat great food and have fun.  Right on the Strip with happy people everywhere!  I've been there many times in the last couple of years and it has never disappointed.  Recently my son and I took a special friend for lunch and we had the best service ever.  Happy Day!  Our servers name was Jose Escobar and he was simply amazing!  Our friend had so much fun, some in part to the excellent suggestions of our waiter.  DO NOT MISS the guacamole, the best ever!  We had a table full of food, all came out hot, delicious and inviting.  We got a personal visit from Ross, an Executive for Lettuce Entertain You and hugs from Ruby at the front.  My goodness we had such a great time and I know you will too if you stop by El Segundo Sol next time you are in Las Vegas.
