Visiting some friends in Vegas and I was craaaaaaaavvvving Mexican food so we went there for lunch.  And this was exactly the fix I needed!! The atmosphere is entertaining, the food was delicious and contrary to some comments on here our server was so attentive and friendly. I think her name was Christina. If you can help it, try and get sat in her area!! 

Definitely going back next time im in town!
