Of all the places in Las Vegas, the one thing that ALWAYS stands out for me is the Owners take the time and come around and say Hi and check to make sure everything is going well. Makes it feel like they know me. The soup is yummy and all their dishes have been perfectly. Birthdays are also fun for a quick shot if thats your thing. Great place to stop with friends and family.
