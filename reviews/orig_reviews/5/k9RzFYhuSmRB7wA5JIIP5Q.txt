Oh how I do love Crescent! This place is the best and most appealing music venue that I've been to in AZ so far...but the good news doesn't stop there - the food is amazing as well! I've had burritos, quesadillas, and burrito bowls, all of which have been amazing. The bean dip, however, is what I'd boast about all day. That and the honey badger of course =).
