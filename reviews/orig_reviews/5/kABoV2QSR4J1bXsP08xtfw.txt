My son and I were looking for some authentic Mexican food during our visit to the Phoenix area. We found Blue Adobe on Yelp and decided to give it a try.
I would recommend you do the same.
The smell from their wood burning ovens started the meal off right. I walked in and said, what ever that smell is I want it!
We ate at the bar and Lori our bartender made my son and I feel like we were locals. My son had their famous Bleu Adobe Burger. He said it was the best burger he's ever had.
I decided to try their Friday night special.It was their seafood enchilada. I usually put lots of hot peppers on my food but the flavor and smell was so incredible I didn't want to ruin it.

Next time we visit Mesa I'll defiantly be back.
