Went here during restaurant week. We had a 3 course meal plus a side which was a lot of food. A great deal for $30. Tried the guacamole and a salad (the one with cranberries, pecans, cheese) for starters, both were excellent.
I had mahi mahi tacos and wife had the carnitas tacos for the 2nd course. Both were amazing. 
We had carne adobo (brisket) and a king prawn for the 3rd course. The carne adobo was incredible as was the king prawn.
The sides of sweet corn and charro beans  were just okay. Overall we left stuffed and very satisfied. Drinks were good, I had a blood orange margarita and wifey had the pomegranite mojito. Both good, but at $12 a little pricey for the volume. 
It was slow tonight. Situated in the Saguaro hotel, it's a little hidden so I hope they make it. We will definitely return.
