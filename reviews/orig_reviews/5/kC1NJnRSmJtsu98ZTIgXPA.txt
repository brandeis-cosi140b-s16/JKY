I could go here any time, any day. I love this place and have been multiple times. Many times while going to school at AiPx. They have quick service and hot food! I love the jade red chicken. I don't even like beans and still, theirs tastes magical! Top it off with a free tasty snickerdoodle and I'd be baffled if you DIDN'T love it. I really never get any of the Mexican dishes, not sure why, but I've scavenged stuff off my friend's plates and of course, it tastes just as good. Quick service, cheap price, tasty food. Go here if you haven't. Right now. GO!
