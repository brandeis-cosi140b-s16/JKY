Excellent tacos. Our first time in so they told us to sample all the meats before making a decision.  I ended up getting 3 tacos of al pastor, green chile pork. And adobada beef. So good! Griddles tortillas were great, meats and toppings were tasty, and don't forget about the great ambiance of lucha!
