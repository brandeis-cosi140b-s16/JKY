I wouldn't call this 100% authentic Mexican food or even Mexican with a Spanish flair. We did, however, coin a new term: "Mex-ish" - which doesn't mean we didn't like it. It means our meal was a delicious interpretation of both styles, creating a new identity and profile for familiar ingredients.

The chips were warm, fresh, and crunchy. The salsa was a green tomato variety, with a refreshing vinegar finish. Our beers were icy cold and both served with ripe, juicy limes.

I had the brisket tamales with red rice and black beans on the side. My husband had the pork chop special with pineapple salsa, kale, and a hybrid mole black bean sauce. The execution was spot on: My tamales were moist and full of flavor, and the brisket could have stood up to any regular BBQ brisket out there. My husband's pork chop was tender and perfectly seared.

Our server was attentive yet did not rush us through the meal.

We will absolutely be planning a return visit - this time, to sample a 5- or 8-course tasting menu.
