Have been going to Elmers since I started high school in 88. Always had great service and yummy food. Elmer even knows all his customers from the high school then and now. 

Elmers is a family tradition for us. We have even gone there to get a new mom their first meal after delivery. That tradition will continue with my twin grandchildren when they come in March.
