Best healthy Mexican out there!

I love the fact the vegetarian options actually have vegetables in them and not just refried beans and rice. The veggie burrito is the best in Charlotte with grilled zucchini and plantains. The plantains really make it!

I love everything about this restaurant. The atmosphere is casual and friendly. Marianela and Zack standout as servers and the managers are all great. 

Taco Tuesday and the lunch specials are unbeatable for the price. You really get a lot of food for the price, much more than anywhere else in plaza midwood, except maybe KickStand next door! Don't let me forget about the margaritas! 1/2 price on Mondays, the jalapeno margarita is a must try!
