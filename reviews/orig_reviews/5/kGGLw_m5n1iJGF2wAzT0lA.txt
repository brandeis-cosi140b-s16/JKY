Given my love of tacos, eating tacos in a church felt pretty fitting.  And, even more fitting, they were some of the best tacos I've ever had.  The chips and salsa they brought out were amazing - there were 4 salsas including a really good verde salsa.  Two of them had quite a kick.

We had the guacamole with caramelized pineapple and mint - delicious!  It was a very generous portion of guacamole as well.  For our meal, I had the chicken, shrimp, and lamb taco and my husband had the chicken, lamb, and al pastor.  All of them were very good.  The tortillas were amazing.  Highly recommend!
