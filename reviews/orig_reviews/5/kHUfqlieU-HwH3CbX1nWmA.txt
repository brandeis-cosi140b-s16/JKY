I love their hard shell carne asada tacos. Everything is so fresh& tasty. The employees are very nice as well. The food is very inexpensive. I work nearby so I try to come here when I can. They should open another location in Phoenix. I think it would do very well as there would not be much competition because their food is so amazing.
