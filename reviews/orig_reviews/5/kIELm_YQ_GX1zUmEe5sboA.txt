Lots of places come up short in Vegas, but Javier's exceeds them.

The atmosphere is dark and beautiful.  Margarita choices for days.  The food is excellent too.  Among our table's favorites:  carnitas, the queso fundido appetizer, and Callitos Mazatlan.  The latter is a scallop dish with a generous portion (4 scallops!) and the black beans served on the side are simple but tasty.
