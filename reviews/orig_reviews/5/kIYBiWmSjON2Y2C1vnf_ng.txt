OK I'm whipping out 5 stars for the brunch carne asada and eggs alone.  The carne asada was fantastic!  When they sit the plate down, it looks like a seasoned NY strip.  What it is, is some of the most tender and flavorful carne asada you will ever have.  I could stop right there.  That's all you need to know...OH and it's only $12.50.

But also when we were there for brunch, my husband ordered his usual bacon, eggs, and taters, which was a great deal as well for $7.50, and while he did enjoy that, he said he wished he would have ordered the carne asada after he tried a few bites of my breakfast.  

We had a couple of brunch mojitos ($5 each) and tried the prickly pear lemonade, also 5 bucks during brunch.  I didn't catch the bartender's name, but he was awesome.  So friendly and fun to talk to, without hovering over us.  This is definitely a favorite brunch spot.  Go get some of that carne asada!
