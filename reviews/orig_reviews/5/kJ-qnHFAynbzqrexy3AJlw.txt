Came here the other night with a friend for dinner. Garrett was our server, who was outstanding, very knowledgeable and personable.  Service was prompt and every employee we interacted with that night was also very friendly and accommodating.  

Great taco Tuesday specials, live solo band that plays some nights, great bar area and an amazing outside patio with wrap around bar.  Food is delicious, haven't had one entrée that I haven't liked.  Started off with the Coconut Calamari for the appetizer, and The Pollo Con Rajas is absolutely delicious!  Our server and general manager of the restaurant talked us in to trying the crème brulee for dessert... TO DIE FOR! You must try.  

All in all.. Great food, Great service, Great people :)
