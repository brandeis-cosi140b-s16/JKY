I love El Encanto. We recently took my grandma and my kid for lunch. If you haven't been you should check it out. There is a really cool outside patio area around a large duck/turtle pond which really is the focal feature of the place. 

The chips and salsa are award winning and the lunch menu is great and really affordable. I had the mole enchiladas and my husband had the fish tacos. Both were excellent.
