We were traveling through town on a new adventure and saw the reviews for this place.. Not the most unique setting and I love sitting in booths rather than tables bit the experience here was amazing.. Great service .. Amazing tasting drinks... Chips and salsa with bean dip as well was a great surprise.. My mango margarita with sugar rim was very tasty... I love this place .. It's a MUST when in town :)

We just had dinner and I am telling you we both were blown away.. The chicken fajitas were amazing... It would be a mistake if you don't try this place.
