Definitely the best place for real authentic fish tacos.. I know this because i grew up in Ensenada and Tijuana MX. Variety is simple Fish and Shrimp but they do a great job mixing it up quesadilla or combo also they have a Barbacoa taco (slow cook tender beef) really recommended. My new favorite place to eat..
