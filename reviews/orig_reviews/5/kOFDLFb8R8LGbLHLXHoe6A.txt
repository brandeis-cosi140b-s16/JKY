Amazing food and amazing place. I go there after work sometimes at 3am, and I love the food and the drinks!! Great margaritas, great chips and dip, and great food all around. They also have some of the nicest bartenders and even the kitchen and the dishwasher staff wave bye to me when I leave. I love this place!!
