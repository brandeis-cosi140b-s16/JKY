My first time coming here, I found this place on Yelp. Cute restaurant, best if you make a reservation, this place fills up! Amber was our server and we loved her! Very sweet personality Food was sooooo good, smaller portions but worth it! I had the chiliquiles, I loved the Carne Asada! Chef Paco also introduced us personally to his grandmothers flan, omg I wish it was bigger it was sooo amazing and creamy! We also had the fried ice cream, I recommend that! This restaurant is kind of hidden but really good! I will be returning soon
