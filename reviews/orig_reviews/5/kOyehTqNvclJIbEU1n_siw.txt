Whenever we have guests visit us, we always take them here.  I love their food, I love their atmosphere and they have such a great wine list.  Honestly, I loved everything that they have. We always get their Guac, their pork shoulder is always fantastic and I love churros.  I think this restaurant is a great way to introduce people to Mexican/Hispanic food that has been elevated to the next level.  Make reservations though, because otherwise you could be chilling at the bar for quite a while.  Though with their Briar Rose and wine list, it wouldn't be such a bad punishment.
