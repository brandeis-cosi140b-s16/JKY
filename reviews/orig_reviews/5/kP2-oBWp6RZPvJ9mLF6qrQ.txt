Love love love the margaritas here. Come for happy hour and they are super cheap! We always get a pitcher and share. Then we share the nachos. Beware these nachos are the best ones around. No nachos will ever compare to these. 2 people can share a small and 3 can share a large. We add carne asada to them and omg are they to die for. Do yourself a favor and try the nachos.
