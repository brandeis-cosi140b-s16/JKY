I would highly recommend this to place to all of the fusion lovers out there! 

Variety
Not only do they have fusion menu that combines Korean and Mexican, but they have separate sections of just Mexican, Asian, and American.

Price
All the items are reasonably priced!  Tacos at 1.65 and entrees about 5-8 bucks!  All three of us ate for 16 bucks!

Menu
If you dine there, they give you free chips, salsa, and guacamole.  I ordered the bulgolgi taco and the pork taco with kimchi on it.  They were pretty hefty tacos for what you pay for them.  We also got the 5 friend wontons for 1.50.

I can't wait to go back so I can try the other items on the menu!
