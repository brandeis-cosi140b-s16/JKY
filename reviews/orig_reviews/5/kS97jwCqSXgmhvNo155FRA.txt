I don't understand the mixed reviews. I actually have came twice today. First thing, if your staying in the Cosmo this is conveniently located right in front of the marquee day/night club. I had the different type of bite size tacos and thought they were amazing.  If your into spicy food, the spicy habanero sauce is no joke. I also ordered the fried rice with beef and was also amazing. Prices are average for the variety of food. After a day of partying this is the place to quickly stop and eat!
