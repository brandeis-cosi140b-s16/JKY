As a big fan of Barrio Cafe and Chef Silvana I was really excited to finally try Barrio Queen recently on a Saturday night. We had to wait for a table but it was well worth it. 

The guacamole is really the best in the area as far as I am concerned. 

The house margarita was very good, made with fresh juices not bottled. If you are into Tequila the Queen does not disappoint, there is a large selection of fine spirits to taste. 

The taco menu is the most interested assortment of tacos that you will find in any upscale Mexican restaurant in the country. Go ahead and try to beat this selection, WOW. Seriously? As a Chef I am thrilled to be able to get tacos here that are better than what I can make for myself. What a fun place. 

The Conchinita Pibil is made in the traditional Yucatan style and is melt in your mouth delicious. 

The Huevo con Chorizo made with Longanisa is outstanding and the egg was perfect as well as a nice surprise. 

My friend loves the Salmon y Mango which is Smoked Salmon with diced Mango and Pico de Gallo 

The Carne Asada and Chile Relleno Taco is a revelation. Wow. 

We had the Tres Leches cake for desert with really good coffee. There are many other dishes that I want to try so I need to go back like, once a week. 

Love this place. The outdoor patio was very nice, the evening weather was warm and there was live music. Our server was very nice.
