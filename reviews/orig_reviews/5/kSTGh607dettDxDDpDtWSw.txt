We went downtown and had a great meal here.  We were seated outside where we got a great view of the fountains and enjoyed the first cool breeze of the fall.  Our drinks arrived with a basket of chips with salsa.  These chips were incredible.  First, you notice a variety of colors and shapes, second you notice they are warm, almost hot, third the fantastic flavor.  They have a dusting of some sort of mild spice.  There were regular corn chips, blue corn chips, flour chips, squash (?) chips, sweet potato chips..lightly salted and the chipotle salsa complemented the combination.  We ordered our meals and knocked off the chips waiting for our food to arrive.  We ordered more chips, (still hot when they arrived from the kitchen) and our meals arrived. My wife had an enchilada something and I had the southwest chicken salad.  Those chips really enhanced the meal.  The flour chips were lighter and softer, yet crispy and not oily.  The sweet potato chips were slightly chewy and were indeed "sweet" and were great.  I had iced tea, my wife had a couple of blue margaritas and said they were very good.  We finished our meals and the chips.  Our waitress brought us a nice white chocolate "tamale" with our check.  If you are looking for a full meal or just want a nice place for a beer or cocktail this is the place.  Try the chips and salsa.
