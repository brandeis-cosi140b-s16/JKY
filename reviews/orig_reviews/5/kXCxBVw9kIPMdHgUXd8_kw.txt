We were very impressed with China Poblano. To start with, you might like to read this informative story about the ideas behind the place: http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/13/dining/13andres.html The decor is very intriguing, with design coming from SEED. The hybridity of Mexico and China is reflected in the interesting visuals--Mao next to Frida Kahlo and other variations. The entrance includes a fast-food looking window (Chinese Food), complete with noodle bar, and a second fast-food window (Mexican Food) with a tortilla bar. The visual design elements heighten the diner's sense that something hybrid is at play here. We really enjoyed our server who was very informative about the choices. We sampled the Love Is in the Air (a molecular gastronomic take on an heirloom tomato salad). We found the play between salty and sweet to be incredible. The sugar foam is very interesting and I found my taste buds unable to determine, at any one moment, whether it was salty or sweet. The Beijing Glass was perhaps the best noodle dish that we have had. It was outstanding in every respect. Dancing Eggplant is a visual dish that includes bonito flakes that move up and down due to the steam rising from the cooked eggplant. Again, an outstanding dish with perfectly cooked eggplant and a delicious sauce. The only down side was the taco (Chicen Mole). As other reviewers have offered, there is nothing to write home about in terms of the tortillas. They don't seem to replicate street food quality. The chicken was tender, but not the best mole. Perhaps they can work out those kinks. Overall, you shouldn't miss this place. The experience and food is intriguing. Jose Andres is a true genius and artist.
