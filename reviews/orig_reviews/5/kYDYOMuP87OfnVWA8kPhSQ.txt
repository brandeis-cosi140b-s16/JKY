I didn't know what to expect when my friend insisted we were going to a Hawaiian chipotle, I was dreading lots of mayo, poi, and spam, but I was more than surprised. 

We were greeted by the super friendly manager (owner?), he explained the selection, and offered suggestions. I really appreciated his positive energy, and could see he was passionate about the menu. 

I went in here with a very small appetite, but once we were given samples of the meat choices, I knew I had to have a full dinner. The steak defiantly stands out; amazing flavor, and soft. Nothing like the dry thin steak you see at other burrito type places. The salsa choices are creatively delicious. Pair the pineapple verde with the steak, you won't regret it. 

We were taking our food to go, but I noticed they had house sauces in small hot sauce bottles. I'm so excited to try those once I'm able to come back.


Oh! And if you remotely enjoy chocolate, coconut, and what I think was caramel, you have to try the coconut bark! It's beautiful.
