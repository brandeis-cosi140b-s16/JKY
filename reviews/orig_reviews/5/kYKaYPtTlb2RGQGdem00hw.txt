This place always amazes me!  I never miss it when I travel to Phoenix.  This has the ambiance of a true gourmet dive bar.  I have never been disappointed with the food, breakfast, lunch, or dinner.  Today I had the Enchiladas and Eggs, one chicken and one pork, smothered in green Chile sauce with eggs over easy.  It is served up with a heaping portion of beans, potatoes, and a tortilla.  The service is top notch and the staff always goes out of their way for you.  If there is a downside it would be lack of parking.  Oh, by the way it is a hideaway! Just don't tell anyone how to get here.  Let them figure it out!
