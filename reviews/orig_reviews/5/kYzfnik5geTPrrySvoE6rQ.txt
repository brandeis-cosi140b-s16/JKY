My gf & I went to try this place on a recommendation from a friend & this place was really amazing. We shared the taquito appetizer. OMG, the potato taquitos were fn good. If there was a taquito entree I would've gotten that. I had gotten the carne asada plate with the chicken enchilada. Everything on my plate was perfect. It tasted like the best home made Mexican food your mom made. The quacamole you get is to die for. I am definitely coming back. The service was friendly & the waitress were in top of everything
