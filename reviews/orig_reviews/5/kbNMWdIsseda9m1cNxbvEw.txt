We have been to Barrio Queen several times and are never disappointed. The restaurant is lovely, the staff is outstanding and the food was amazing. The pork carnitas are the best we have ever had. Our last visit was a party of 11 and everyone was pleased with their meal. We sat on the comfortable patio and loved watching people walk by while we enjoyed dinner and drinks. I think it is one of the top patios in town.
