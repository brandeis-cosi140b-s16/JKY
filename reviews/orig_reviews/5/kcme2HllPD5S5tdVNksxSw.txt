Great service and awesome food and drinks here! My server was Lewis and he killed it! Lauren Paris also had served me and she rocked it as well! Thank you two so much! I love coming here after I get off work at Tilted Kilt on the Linq and they never disappoint with their happy hour either! I will be back for sure! ;)
