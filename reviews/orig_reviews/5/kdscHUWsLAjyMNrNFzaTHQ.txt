Easily a five star restaurant. My husband and I moved to Las Vegas almost a year ago and dinner last night at Mundo is the best meal I've had here. The decor is very chic and feels relaxing and inviting and the staff is super friendly. It was my birthday and we had a coupon from travelzoo.com for 2 drinks, 1 app, 2 entrees, and 1 dessert for $55. We paid for tax ($10) and tip ($25) so dinner was $90. I had a margarita and hubs had a mojito, both were good. For our appetizer, we had the skirt steak skewers, they were good. The skewers were served with a chimichurri sauce and a side of marinaded avocados and a kind of latin cole slaw. I had the sea bass, it was delicious. The fish was cooked well and came with a jalapeno and a roma tomato on top and was served with potatoes. It  was cooked in parchment paper and had great flavor. My husband ordered the scallops, they were cooked perfectly and had great flavor. Our dessert was the banana empanadas, they were amazing. The empanadas came with a small scoop of vanilla ice cream and a caramel sauce. I would highly recommend the empanadas. Since it was my birthday, they brought me a free shot of tequilla. I would not hesitate to eat here again and Mundo would be a great place to bring friends, family, or clients. Mundo was not busy for dinner on a Thursday night but that is not surprising since it is located in the World Market Center which closes at 6. I would like to try their happy hour.
