Great spicy food that will knock your socks off!  I've been eating at the Alma School location for 20 years, and the food has never let me down.  Sometimes if the place is busy, the service might be a little slow, but that's true for most of the family-owned mexican places in town.    Plan ahead and deal with it and stop the whining!   Many of the critical reviews I've read either miss the point or don't understand what New Mexican food is about (the food is spicy and full of flavor, and if you can't handle the heat, blame yourself and not the restaurant).   Pinto beans are the norm, not refried beans, and they really don't need much seasoning.  The place is a landmark, and for good reason!
