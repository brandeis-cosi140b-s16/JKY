Mi Patio is our favorite restaurant.  Not just our favorite Mexican restaurant...our favorite restaurant, period.  I love the Greek influence since most "traditional" Mexican restaurants in phoenix look at me funny when I ask for vegetables.  

The servers are always fast and friendly.  the owner and managers talk with us like we've been friends our entire lives even though they may not even recognize that we are regulars.  we eat at mi patio for dinner, lunch and get lunch takeout.  it is always exactly what we were hoping for.  

if you enjoy hot sauce we've discovered that they make a spicy sauce using Frank's red hot but you have to ask for it.  we ask for the diablo sauce since that is what they use for the diablo shrimp dish.

mi patio is great for vegans too.  they don't cook anything with lard and give you the opportunity to order anything without the cheese, without looking at you like your crazy.  Ive enjoyed the vegetable enchiladas (Mushroom, Zucchini, Egg Plant) without cheese and didn't feel like i was missing out on flavor.

their chips and salsa are my favorite in all of phoenix and they give you plenty with your food whether its to stay or to go.  

kids are always treated with respect and they have tons of tolerance for our occasionally screaming 1 year old.  the kids meals have huge portions that make for great left overs and ice cream when theyre done!  our 5 year old asks to eat at mi patio at least twice a week.

we LOVE the margaritas!  there's nothing fancy about them but who needs fancy when you get to pay 2 or 3 bucks for a big ass margarita!? 

don't let the outside of the building trick you into thinking its just a sleazy Mexican bar.  the beer banners totally turned me off before my husband made me try it for the first time.  just walk inside and enjoy the best of Phoenician Mexican food!
