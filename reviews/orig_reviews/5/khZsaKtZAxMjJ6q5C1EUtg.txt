They sell Mexican food and have Star Wars posters on the wall, so they're off to a good start with me.

Service is outstanding here. When I sat at the bar, they were very quick to keep my water glass full.

Their tacos, drinks, and ceviche are all tasty and well made. The carne asada taco is a little on the spicy side, so be ready for it.

I have enjoyed both times here, and I'm sure I'll come back for more.
