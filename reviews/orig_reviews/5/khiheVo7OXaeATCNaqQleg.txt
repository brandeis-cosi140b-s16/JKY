This bar is idle for spring training games.  Right next door to Peoria sports complex. It has a great "cantina" atmosphere with a huge outdoor venue. Perfect for post game shenanigans !!!! Get a cab home though. It starts getting blurry  about sun down.  So call yellow cab, take a shot of patron and slam a glass of water. Then hit the backyard BBQ !!
