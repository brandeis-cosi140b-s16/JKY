Ok. Seriously. Not kidding. The BEST carne asada burrito I have ever eaten. Hands down. The rice excellent. Salsa amazing and they made the guacamole in front of us. TASTEE! My wife had enchiladas and she loves them. For me the enchiladas not quite as good as the burrito but hey the burrito was out of the park so I guess I am biased.
