One of the best Mexican restaurants I have ever visited. Chorizo Fundido was so creamy and delicious! Yummy sea bass. Husband loved the Sonoran meatloaf. Have an iced Treasure Margarita. Dana is a fantastic waiter! Going back again tonight! Sit outside in the patio! Heaters if you get cold. Barratt Jackson visitors need to dine here!!!
