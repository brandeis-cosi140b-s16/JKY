Salsa and Chips are HUGE....Great location, great waiter and seating staff and very good food.  I am not Mexican but I eat Mexican food almost every week.  The food was very good, cost effective, and the location is right in the middle of everything. Stop here and get a drink and an appetizer.  We did this the night before I left but we should have went here sooner......
