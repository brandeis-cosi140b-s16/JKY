Overall good experience here. First walked in with an entire group that was very confused where the line was. So I veered away from them and went to the bar. They served me faster than the people in line. Tacos were a little small, I had to have about 3 to feel full. I had the beef ones and I noticed maybe some pork or uncooked meat was in mine. I couldn't tell, I don't eat pork but it was more red and definitely wasn't beef. This shocked me but I just took it out and continued eating. I eat all organic so this food didn't upset me. It was pretty tasty actually. Very clean and upscale location. Lady I was next to said there's one on tropicana and this one was clearly nicer. They also have a cool upstairs seating area!
