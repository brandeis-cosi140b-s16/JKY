Mi patio do you keep your servers on a strict diet of beatings, verbal intimidation, and benzedrine?
because my server was insanely good-so good that it was suspicious... like this gentleman had his A game on, no effing joke, and i noticed he never said one word to us and never really looked us in the eye in a word: servile.
we'd be sitting there and he'd be back with fresh refills of our beverages and a non stop, everlasting supply of chips and salsa the second our portions got vaguely low. once we'd barely touched our chips he'd be back with a brand new batch piping hot and crispy. probably amongst the best service i have ever encountered in my short life.
Now as far as the food goes, top knotch! knotch has a silent k right? lets assume it does.
the food here is deeee lish us! berry berry nice! 
and cheap as dirt! i swear mi patio must be running dope on the side their food and drinks are so cheap! how can they afford this!? seriously!?
(sheriff joe and your cronies/goons if for some ungodly reason your're reading this the aforementioned comments were complete hyperbole and meant to be taken lightly)
Mi patio you are a gem a true gem. great location, great prices, great food, superb service!
