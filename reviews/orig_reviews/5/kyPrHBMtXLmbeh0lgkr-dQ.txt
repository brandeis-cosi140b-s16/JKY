The food was pretty darn excellent. I got the smothered burrito and i couldn't have wanted anything more. The Margarita even somehow made me happier than most margaritas. But, the real gem was the atmosphere. The patio was awesome, and the decorations were about as authentic as you can get. The service was fast, friendly, and our servwr ended up chatting with us for a bit. I'd definitely love to go back.
