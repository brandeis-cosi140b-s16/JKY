Yummy authentic Mexican food. A must try for any Mexican food lover. All homemade, the Tinga is awesome. My new favorite place to enjoy REAL Mexican that I have been searching for in Phoenix. Homemade salsa bar, fresh ingredients. I would have taken a picture of my Chile Verde burrito but I ate it all, next time.
