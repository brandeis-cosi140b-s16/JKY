I actually drove here in the mood for cheesesteak, planning to try Geri's Old Philadelphia Restaurant after reading about it on Yelp.  When I arrived, however, Geri's was closed today for some reason.  I looked around and saw Taco y Taco.  A quick check on Yelp, and I was suddenly in the mood for al pastor!  Their style is similar to Chipotle - building your order to taste, but sooooo much better! The burrito al pastor is monstrous, and the al pastor was some of the tastiest I've had!  Their "Mexican corn" (esquite) is a must try, as well.  To top it all off, they have bomb horchata, and one of the most generous salsa bars I've seen!  I'll definitely be adding this to my list of regular spots.
