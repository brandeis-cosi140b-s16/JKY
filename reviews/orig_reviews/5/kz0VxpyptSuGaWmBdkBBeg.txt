I have had few Korean Mexican mixes before, and I gotta say that they did a great job! 

We ordered Fusion burrito with beef and Fusion bulgogi fries with kimchi. They are both really delicious but that fries... it's a must. 

Service was wonderful, quick, and delightful. 

Overall, wonderful  place that's well deserving of your money.
