We loved our service! Definitely a team oriented place. Daniel H. the manager was brilliant. He filled in when our handsome server Cory was preoccupied by other tables. The food and especially the cocktails were delicious! My mom went the night before and got the ensalada fila and it was spectacular! Thank you for a wonderful first experience, I will be returning soon xoxo
