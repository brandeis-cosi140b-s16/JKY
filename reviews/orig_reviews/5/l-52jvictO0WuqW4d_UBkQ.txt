Such a fun food fusion. I've never had this food combo before and didn't know what to expect. But needless to say, my mouth was left with surprises. You won't be disappointed!
The decor is simple, but there is no need to fluff up the dining area when the food is focus.
I gladly drive the 20 minutes to eat here.
