This review is long over due, but better late than never. I just wanted to give a giant THANK YOU to Mary the G.M. at Gonzalez. On Saturday, April 27, 2013 she and all over her staff front and back were absolutely amazing and worked with us immensely on short short notice. 

The back story: 
We had just finished up with a wedding and the Bride (my cousin) decided she wanted the entire bridal party and all the guests to meet at Gonzalez's in New York New York for a celebratory dinner. Mind you this was NOT preplanned so we did not have a reservation and had a party over 20+ headed that way. My girlfriend and I were one of the first ones there and took it upon ourselves to get a reservation in. We were extremely worried with the amount of people expected that we would not be able to all be seated at one time. The hostess was unable to book a reservation of that size on short notice without the G.M's approval...so we spoke with Mary. Mary was amazing (I couldn't say it enough). She and her staff cleared out the left side of the restaurant as the guests left and "reserved" the tables for our party. They were able to pull a table together for the entire party and saved some seats along the outside of the table for any stragglers. 

They we're more than accommodating with our needs and even with a party of our size the service was great. Each person we encountered was happy and smiled and was willing to help service our needs. The food was prompt (a little slower than normal, but nothing outrageous taking in our groups size and short notice).

Needless to say the Bride and Groom and everyone who came were extremely please with the attention Gonzalez's staff gave all of us, the food, and the experience in general. 

Next time I'm in Vegas I will make it a point to stop back in and have another Beer-A-Rida (or three) and the yummy chips and salsa! 

Thanks again Mary - you guys were truly life savers!!
