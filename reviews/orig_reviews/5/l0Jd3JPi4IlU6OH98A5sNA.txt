We had an outstanding dinner here! 
The restaurant was very quiet for a Sunday night, quite pleasant actually. There was no wait, and we were seated right away. 

1)Started with warm chips and 3 bottomless salsas: Chipotle, Tomatillo and Rojo. All delicious!

2)Small plate - Corn Masa Quesadillas: Chihuahua & oaxaca cheese, corn, roasted poblano, zucchini, tomatillo salsa, crema fresca, and topped with chicken. These flavors are incredible together! One of the best things I've eaten in Las Vegas. I would come back just for this. But it gets better...

3) Tacos - THE LOBSTER TACOS!!!... I'm speechless! 4 street tacos generously loaded with deliciously prepared lobster chunks, on a bed of succulent corn and other veggies. I want more.

4) Large plate - Short rib enchiladas with red sauce. YUM! so good!

We didn't get any drinks, but I can't wait to come back to try the margaritas and the "Little Market" drink. Our server, Becky, was awesome, and the staff made sure our waters were filled the entire time. Great experience! Can't wait to come back!
