I hurt my right thumb, so I will give it 1 thumb up.  If I had many thumbs, I would give it infinite thumbs up. The first thing you need to do is go to the bar and order a berry mojito.  It is the bartender's speciality, and it has a light flavor, and it is not overbearing with the mint like a lot of places do.

The food selection is quite interesting, and I went with the Aztec Chicken, which basically had grilled chicken stuffed with peppers and other veggies.  The flavors for this dish were amazing, and I was watering my mouth when I ate the leftovers the next day.  Usually a great sign of great food is when it tastes pretty good the next day as well.
