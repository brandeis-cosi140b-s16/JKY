Tonight my wife and I had dinner there. Our server 's name was Brad. As far as his customer service goes, it was excellent. He was polite and helpful, and not over the top.

We have been there several times, for happy hour and for dinner and the food keeps getting better. 

I don't understand all these bad reviews honestly. It's such a well designed restaurant and perfect for all ages. (No, I don't work there.) Its just a really great place to have a margarita and some real New Mexican food in a really cool dinning area.
