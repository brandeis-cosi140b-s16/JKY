My husband and I used to frequent this restaurant A LOT before we had our baby. I used to be vegan and their veggie fajitas made it possible for me to have the best meal without any animal products in it. Everything, including their chips and salsa, are made in house. Service has always been very attentive and accurate. If you have a chance, sit at the bar and Carlos will take great care of you. He is friendly, remembers what you order, talks with you but doesn't overstay. We have not been there in a little while because we live so far from it but we will definitely return and I can't wait.
