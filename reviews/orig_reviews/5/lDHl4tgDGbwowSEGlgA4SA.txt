This place is the one that won me over for fusion dishes, and enjoying a good amount of kimchi. I have yet to find a dish I never fully enjoyed. Also loving the idea of getting a good amount of food and not paying much, especially when I treat my sister out to lunch here. 
Their customer service is always good - very personable staff that I always see regularly when I make it out there.
