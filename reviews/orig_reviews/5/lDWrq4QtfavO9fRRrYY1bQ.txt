I love Mexican food. If I could eat it all day every day, I probably would. Pittsburgh unfortunately does not have a huge Mexican food scene, but most of the places are very good.

This place is simply delicious. I moved to the city from the country last summer, and this was one of the first places my boyfriend took me on a "date" to. He knows my love for Mexican and he knows all the hidden gems around the city. They only have tacos here, but they are done perfectly.

I was a little weary about eating tacos from a cart on the street, but those fears were immediately subdued when I took my first bite. We took our tacos to my car and ate them off sitting off the truck on my car since it was a nice day out. Coke in glass bottles for drinks! The tacos were super delicious and unlike any other taco I have ever had. Really fresh and seasoned perfectly. The 2 tacos were really filling surprisingly! They have a bunch of fresh toppings for your tacos so you can customize however you want.

I will be back to this spot for sure!
