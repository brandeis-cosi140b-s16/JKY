Love yelp for this reason. I travel quite a nit with my husband. I'm  usually in charge of finding the restaurants.  I prefer to go to the local spots which usually has the best food at good prices. Fat Boy delivered! Real jalapeno cheeseburger with clench fries!!!! AMAZING! my hubby went for the double bacon cheeseburger....a monster of a burger! So yummy cheap fast and friendly service. I was mad that I was too full to order the chicken and bean boyrrito!
