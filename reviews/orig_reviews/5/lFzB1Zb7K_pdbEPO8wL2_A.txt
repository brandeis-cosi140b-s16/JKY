This is probably the best "Mexican" food I have ever had in Phoenix!!!  I cannot say enough great things about this place.  The guacamole is amazing and they add pomegranate seeds it and its the most fabulous thing in the world!  I am obssessed with their margaritas!  This place is a little pricey but its soooooooooooooo worth it!  Try their enchiladas you cannot go wrong!  The atmosphere is awesome...the outside area is little scary but that is apart of the charm.  Do not forget dessert with the churros for dessert!!!  You will leave this place so satisfied and happy and maybe a little tipsy from the margaritas and tequila shots...lol...go here go here go here!!!
