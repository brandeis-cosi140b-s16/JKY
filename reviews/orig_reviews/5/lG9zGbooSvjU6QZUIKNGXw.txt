While we were staying in Las Vegas for a trip we had a craving for tacos, so my husband found this place by doing a search on urban spoon. I was a little skeptical at first because my husband has a tendency to take me to sketchy areas for food while we're traveling which usually leads to a spat because I worry something bad is going to happen to us. It was a small trek and it's a little bit off the strip, but it was well worth it.

This is hands down the best tacos I've ever had in my entire life! These were even better than the food we had while staying in Cabo. I still have cravings for this place. If this place was near us we'd be there at least once a week if not more! 

When we go back to Vegas we'll definitely make our way back here. Don't be skeptical if you're from out of town, you won't regret it!
