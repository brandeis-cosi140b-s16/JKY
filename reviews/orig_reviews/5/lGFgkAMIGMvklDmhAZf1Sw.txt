I have spent a lot of time at Hussongs Las Vegas in the last year and wanted to make sure everyone was aware of this "gem" at Mandalay Place. I know the name from the famous location in Ensenada, Mexico so I wanted to see if it was the same. Although there are slight differences like cleanliness and they serve food unlike Mexico, the atmosphere and good times abound! The "Banda" is awesome and makes it for a good time during the night, the bar serves great drink specials. My favorite food items are the Nacho's and Baja Tacos... Keep an eye out on FB for specials - thats how I stay updated with them. Dont forget the "Shocker"!
