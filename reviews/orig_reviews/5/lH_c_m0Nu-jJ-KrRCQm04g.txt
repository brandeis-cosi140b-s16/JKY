oh Tacos El Gordo, you definately take me back to the days when I was 18 and partying in Tijuana, Mexico!! 

Love the tacos although I normally stick to the carne asada and adobado (con todo) and the quesadillas are AMAZING! The quesadillas are different than how I remember- they have a tortilla (corn or flour) and then the cheese and meat of choice, then they had a crunchy fried tortilla on top! 

Another menu item I love is the adobada fries(half size)- I'm not one hundred percent sure what the green sauce is but its delicious! 

My friend Tony tried the lengua, cabeza, and tripe and he thinks that the cabeza should be "highly recommended"

Needless to say, everytime I go I overindulge and have to hit the gym hard to compensate lol

**I truly wish it were a 24 hour establishment, but then again maybe its a good thing it's not!

**also- BRING CASH for tips! there are tip jars all along the counter for the people who are slaving away cooking these food coma-inducing treats!
