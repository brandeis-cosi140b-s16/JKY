I really appreciate it when a restaurant takes a simple concept and runs with it. There's no need to overcomplicate the menu if done right, and my friends, Gadzooks is a shining example of that. 

The menu is straightforward, enchiladas and soup. Enchiladas are prepped Chipotle style, by which I mean, you go down a line adding fillings/toppings to customize your 'ladas. If you know how your taste buds work, you shouldn't have a problem putting together a winning combination! This is especially true because everything is tasty. I've had the pleasure of trying the chicken, spare rib, pork, and bison (only served at lunch), and all left me craving more. My two favorites are probably the bison and the chicken though. As far as other ingredients to add, there's a great variety. Fresh veggies, salsas, sauces, guacamole, and even housemade crema set a definitive line between eating here and eating at your favorite Mexican hole-in-the-wall. Oh, and wasn't there something about soups? Nope. Soup. Gadzooks has one, it's tortilla; it sits in a huge pot on the stove intensifying and enhancing its flavors as the day goes on. Add some chicken to it, top it with some cheese, and send me a compliment about it later. I personally can't say no to the stuff.

Gadzooks is one of my new favorite spots. With great service, consistent quality, and delicious food, this simple concept could be all over the valley in no time. I am very pleased to have it in the neighborhood.
