This place has some good tortillas for the tacos! They're homemade which is always a good sign. The tortillas are thick which helps them not fall apart. The carne asada was of good quality beef for the price, unlike other places that used cheap greasly beef. The shrimp tacos are made with deep fried breaded shrimp which I did not know because they aren't advertised as such, but they were still good. All in all they were good tacos, for a fair price.
