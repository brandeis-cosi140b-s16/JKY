I love yayo. Been going there for years. The tacos are great and inexpensive. The student special makes the cost even better! The bottled beer selection is solid but the selection of tequilas is fantastic - approximately 150. Plus, the staff is real friendly. And don't worry if it looks shut down. That happens every once in a while, but they reopen rat-free in a short time, always.
