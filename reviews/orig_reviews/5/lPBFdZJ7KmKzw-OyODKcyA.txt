I always order the signature Sielgal Plate.  Tender grilled chicken, marinated steak, the flash fried onions make it really tasty.
I opt in for the fried egg on top just because( the New Mexican in me like fried eggs on top of lots of other stuff too. )

The only thing is that they should serve with tortillas...
Table side Guac is bomb too.

What else....the trio of salsa is delish served w the chips makes waiting for your meal easy to deal with.

Lastly the decor is modern without the stereo typical "straight outta Mexico" feel
