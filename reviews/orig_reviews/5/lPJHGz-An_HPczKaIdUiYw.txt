This is tthhoouurrgghhllyy gooood. 
As I walked in I went through my checklist of pre-meal approval. 
x Tasty Aroma
x Other People 
x People of the restaurant's nationality 
x Satisfied Diners
And a bonus of being able to see the chefs cooking. 

The wait staff was friendly, patient, fast, amd attentive. I split the Torta Del Rey with my Father, my mother got the Sope, and my brother ordered a chicken Quesedilla. Let it also be known that there is an exotic, extensive, and large drink selection including a fantastic fruit selection. 

As my meal came 10-15 minutes later I was not disappointed. The torta was huge and split in half, perfect to share. Instead of listing what was on the torta, it would probably be easier to list what was nt in the torta. It tasted like I was eating a farm. I will do my best to list out what was on this monster. Ham, Sausage Omelet, I think chicken, tomato, avocado, onion, and more! As a Jew, I have had a lot of great sandwiches, and this is right there at the top. By the time I was finishing I had to use my fork, for it was falling apart (always a good thing). My mother's Sope was delicious. As was my brother's quesidilla. 

Now their drinks were absolutely amazing. I got the watermelon agua de frescas and I am still dumbfounded on how they made this. It looked like they took a hunk of watermelon, put it in a glass, and served it. But the description says there is also water and sugar. It was big, flavorful, and refreshing. I think that the drink is what a desert oasis must be like. 

I will highly highly recommend coming here. I highly highly recommend getting the torta del rey. I highly highly recommend getting the watermelon drink. This was one of the best meals I have ever had. I recommend before you die and for your soul to come have a meal here. This was thoroughly good.
