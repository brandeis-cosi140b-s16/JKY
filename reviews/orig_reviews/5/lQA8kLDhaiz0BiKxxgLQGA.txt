We know Mexican food but Los Sombreros showed us food that we hadn't seen prepared or presented before. From the foods to our server, Yolanda, everything was terrific. Our usual go-to place is 45 minutes away in Cave Creek. Los Sombreros is much closer and the menu is much more refined. We would recommend Los Sombreros to anyone wanting excellent value for their money. The patio is amazing.
