Tako - what can I say.  I love you.  I visited the first week you were open and I visited during restaurant week and at least once between those 2 visits and again a few weeks ago.  

First off - the staff and service at Tako is the best.  We have always had reservations (i don't recommend going without them), and have always been promptly seated.  

Second off - the food.  I've done a variety of things for appetizers - specialty quac, queso, salsa - all of which is amazing.  They are always willing to bring extra chips too!  My fav - thus far - is the Korean tacos.  I have tried a few of the others, but once I tried the Korean tacos - I was sold.  No need to try others!  They are the best.  

Just a note to future patrons - you get 2 tacos per order.  I would suggest you and your friend get 2 different kinds, then you can share!  It's the best way to try multiple tacos!
