After I ate here.. everything else taste like taco bell.. the chips and salsa alone are enough to die for .. the tacos are so good you would think they FedEx them from Mexico .. and don't eat the friend ice cream or you going to have to go to rehab that thing is addictive .. my favorite go to spot for Mexican dishes they are the best in town!
