Love this place.  Best fish tacos that remind me of Cabo.  Friendly staff are a lot of fun.  It has an open air patio with a fire pit.  The place is really clean and a lot of families come in to eat.  If you like Mexican food, this is it!  They also have great bar food and 24 hour breakfast.  It's the place to watch a game and the staff will change the channel on any of their 10 huge flat screens.
