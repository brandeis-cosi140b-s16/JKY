I think this place has some of the best tacos in town. I highly recommend the vampiro. It's a carne asada taco on steroids. The guac is fantastic and mashed at your table. My fiance and I love Sol's margaritas. I've had the house and ginger blueberry. Both were very good. This place had a very cool vibe, it's stylish but not pretentious. I highly recommend this place
