Cafe Rio! Better than Chipotle and any other fast food Mexican food. The only thing I don't like are the prices. It is almost $20 for everything I want! That is a little expensive, but it's worth it. 

My cousin raved about this restaurant, and I did not try it until October. I have been in love since! 

My favorite thing to order is the fire grilled chicken quesadilla. The order is huge - it is usually big enough for 2 meals. The tortillas are fresh and giant. you will also need to order the Queso dip. It is amazing and the best thing on the menu by far. I will sometimes dip my quesadilla in it. It is pure heaven.
