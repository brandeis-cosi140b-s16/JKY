I'm updating my previous review because some things have changed. They have added a steak breakfast burrito & taco to the menu, I'm so happy about that because I've been asking them to do that. Let me tell you, they did not disappoint. The burrito was so big I could only get my hand half way around it. This was now the second time I have gotten the burrito & so far it's consistent. The steak was very tender & no grizzle & it was loaded in the burro. It was also heaping with eggs & the spicy mayo & added pico puts it over the top. I have to note that the prices on all the burritos & tacos have increased but you get what you pay for. The burritos are now $4.29 & the tacos are $1.99. The only thing that I'm not happy about is that the sides of salsa have doubled in price, I think 50 cents is a bit high for 2 ounces of salsa, but you get your first one free with purchase.
