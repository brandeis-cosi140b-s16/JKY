The new patio is open!!! I no longer live in Pittsburgh, but every time I visit I HAVE to come to Round Corner! Best tacos in the city. I always get the pescado (fish tacos) and a Mexicana michelada ( Dos Equis larger, jalape√±o, cilantro, lime, and salt) so fresh and amazing. Must try! Bring friends and enjoy the summer nights! Cheers!
