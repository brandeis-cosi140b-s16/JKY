Unlike most eateries in Phoenix where often I take on a "willfully blind" approach to service/ambiance,etc, I actually felt as though I was not in Phoenix the moment I arrived in this dark toned jewel of a restaurant.  Simply put, the dining experience exceeded any expectations I had for the evening.  Gorgeous stemware perfectly complimented a very understated and meticulously considered wine list.  Upon the arrival of my main course, I suffered through slobber fits while awaiting the rest of the tables food (momentary wait).  The Surf n Turf (dungeness crab enchiladas, bacon wrapped jumbo prawns, delicious mashed potatoes, and perfectly cooked piece of beef - $29) - was served on girthy plates framed by an artfully presented dish.  Healthy portions, overflowing flavor and subtly attentive service catapulted the Rokerij to the top of my Valley favorites.  If a single dining experience could suggest of more delectably similar experiences to come, this was it!  Every meal at the table was equally as well received as mine and I don't think you'll find a better salad than the Rokerij concoction we partook in prior to the main course...simply put, a superlative dining experience from start to finish!  

I can't wait to return for their "small plate" and $7 glass of wine happy hour.
