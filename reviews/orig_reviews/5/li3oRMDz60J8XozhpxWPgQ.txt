We know Mexican food, and Rositas was great. The shredded beef in the chimmis was the best we have had. We liked the guacamole was very creamy and good. Guacamole is like potato salad, there are all kinds, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Desert was more than you could  eat,and good no complaints on the drinks . Staff very friendly and prompt.
