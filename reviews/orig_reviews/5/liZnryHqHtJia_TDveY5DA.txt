Oh my damn! My new go to! I cannot wait to bring my friends and family here. 
My boyfriend and I went a little overboard ordering. But everyone's review said try everything and we basically did just that. 

For appetizers we got the medium shrimp cocktail and the carne asada nachos. Both were pretty good. The nachos beat any kind of bar nachos out of the park! 

I had to try the shrimp cocktail. It was good however the shrimp were whole and I guess I expected more of a ceviche. 

After we devoured those, I finally got my hands on the main reason I went there. Shrimp tacos. I have been on the hunt for a decent shrimp taco that is going to break the bank. And all I can say is wow! Great flavor and spices, the peppers and onions, just speechless because I'm shoving another taco in my mouth. 

My boyfriend got the chicken taco which is currently in the fridge because we are stuffed but I am positive it will live up to the expectations. 

I can't wait to come back and try the rest of the menu!
