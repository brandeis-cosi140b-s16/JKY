Amazingly good Mexican food in Gilbert of all places! As good as if not better than the real Los Dos Molinos in Phoenix (the dump in Mesa isn't really Los Dos). Beautifully decorated, fast servers, and arguably the best Mexican food in the state! The food was spicy and delicious but never inedibly hot as it sometimes is other places.
