Rito's... Hands down some of the tastiest mexican in town. If you like chain mexican, or have and nervousness about going to the "hood". then take your weak taste buds and your timid self elsewhere.

If you do venture to Rito's you'll find amazing green chili burros and fantastic tacos awaiting you. It doesn't matter how often I go, It always seems like I forget how great this stuff is.

Maybe it is chock full o' lard, maybe it has ground up unicorns or fairy dust, but whatever it is. It's magically delicious....
