Freakin' awesome. A defensive end size man with the coolest Easter island tattoos takes your order. If you want freshly made to order food in bite size attractively priced- here is your place. The flavor profile of each menu item is well thought out and balanced, and delightfully not swimming in oil. Authentic, no nonsense, and well worth the trip. Will be back to try the tamales which were sold out!
