This is one of my favorite restaurants in the valley, seriously! The atmosphere is great, first off. So much personality in the colors, paintings, plants, and other unique Mexican decorating accents. I knew it was a cool place the first time I went there as soon as I saw the Frida Kahlo painting on the wall that you see when you first walk in. There is always someone  smiling to greet you and take you to your seat, which I've never had to wait for. 

It is quite a large place, and each room is decorated differently - one room even has a mural-type painting on the walls of a scene in a charming-looking Latin American town. The waitresses wear dresses that reflect their culture. 

I noticed instantly that most of the customers were of Hispanic descent (a really good sign!) and that the staff had thick accents. I felt like maybe I wasn't in the States anymore! 

Oh yea, and the food is SSSSOOOOO good. I like it that their menu has a photo of every single meal they serve. That rocks! And, they have levels of spiciness for the hotter dishes on the menu -- five chili peppers next to the description means you better be able to handle the heat they serve!!
