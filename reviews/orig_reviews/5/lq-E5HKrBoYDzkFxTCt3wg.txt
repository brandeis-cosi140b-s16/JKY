These were the best tacos on the east side that I've had. Very authentic and inexpensive. Nice people and the place is very clean. The only thing I wasn't too crazy about was their guacamole as I don't like it pur√©ed. I like it chunky. But that is no bug deal. I HIGHLY recommend people to try this place.
