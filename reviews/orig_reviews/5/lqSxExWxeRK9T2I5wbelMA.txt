I became a huge Richardsons fan since the first day I ate there back in 1998. I've been a follower of all his food/restaurant concepts throughout all these years. I love going to Rokerij's dimly lit bar in the basement on a Sunday morning while devouring my Enchiladas and Eggs. I always get the same dish every time, but its like a party in my mouth with every bite. I've also come here for their great happy hour specials. How can anyone pass up $5 small dishes, which honestly are not small at all. No one will ever be disappointed with the outstanding customer service, food, drinks, and cozy environment that Rokerij has to offer. 

P.S. Remember to always make reservations for diner.
