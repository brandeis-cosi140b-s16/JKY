Taco Taco is amazing. From the Al Pastor and Chorizo Tacos to the Nachos and Vampiro. Nothing has been disappointing so far. All of the tacos run about 2 bucks, very affordable and even the small Nachos running around 6 bucks is a steal. You get a mountain of them! I am officially making Taco Taco my favorite taco spot!
