This place is a gem, hands down!  The watermelon Sangria is amazing!  We had Halibut, Short Ribs, Del Patron and Camarones a la Diabla family style.  We couldn't decide what was the best entree!  In our indecision, we ate the most fabulous dessert, the bread pudding.  Chef Oscar, from Columbia, visited with us.  So down to earth and nice!  This is a must in Vegas!
