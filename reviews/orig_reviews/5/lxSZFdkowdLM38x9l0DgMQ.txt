Awesome place. The taco very authentic for what you will find in Mexico. I stopped her for lunch on Sunday. Not crowded. Very clean. I had the fish tacos. They were excellent. Crunchy and tender inside.  You can top it with anything they have like cilantro onion cremation etc. I also had 3 small tacos: barbacoa, green chilli chicken and carna asada. The barbacoa was my favorite. Deep flavor and med heat. The others were great also..

Can't wait to return with my wife!
