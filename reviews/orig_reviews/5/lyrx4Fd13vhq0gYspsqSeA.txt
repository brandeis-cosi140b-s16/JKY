Can I tell you how much I love this place! I am going to!!   The absolute best Mexican food in the Valley. I love the Chicken soup here. Nothing is better.
I was sick with a respiratory thing and this Chicken Soup was my saving soul food.
I stopped in to get it to go about 5 times during my illness. I drove 22 miles round trip and worth every step.
My experience here with the food has been above and beyond our expectations every time. The food is fresh, and delicious. The Chicken soup is heavenly and if you do not feel well. It is all you need.
The chips and salsa and fresh and wonderful!
Cheese enchiladas, Chicken tacos(hard shell), and the Beef tacos,my favorites on all of these. 
It is family owned, which might be another reason it is so good. They really care about the food,how it tastes, if it is hot, and fresh.
It is very clean here, as well as the restrooms. You must park in the back ,that can be a little tricky if you have a large vehicle. Just go slow. One way in , and one way out. 
If I could give them 10 stars I would.
