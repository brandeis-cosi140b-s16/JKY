I just L O V E this place!  This is one of the most authentic places I've been to yet!   I felt like I was in an old restaurant in Mexico!  I went with a large group and EVERYONE loved it!!  They have an array of salsas that can't be beat along with their tacos!  But watch out for the heat!!   they give you samples as well of anything you want!  AMAZING!  AMAZING!  AMAZING!!  I'll be headed back very soon!!  And I don't say that about a restaurant!!
