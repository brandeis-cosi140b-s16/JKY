We visited juans on Sunday and as always were very happy with the food and great service by our waiter Omar and his busser.   We started with 2 happy hour beers and an iced tea.  Omar always starts us with a heaping plate of chili's toreados and queso fundido.  We love the fried chili's and onions rolled in tortillas.   Our meal started with a cup of fideo soup always yummy and full of flavor.  While the draw here is the flaming fajitas our favorite has always been the seafood parillada for 2.  It is shrimp, fish and scallops on a bed of grilled onions.  While it was for 2, the 3 of us did not finish it and there was still some fish on the plate.  Omar finished our meal with a complimentary fried ice cream.  Service and food have always been top notch here and all your requests are easily met.  We have been coming here at least once a month since they opened and if we did not have a 45 minute drive across town to get there it would definitely be more often.  Our bill was $45 + a $15 tip for $60 total.
