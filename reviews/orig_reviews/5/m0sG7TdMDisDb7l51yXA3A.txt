My girlfriend has been going to Pedros since she was 12 and always raves about this place.  I decided to try it recently and absolutely loved their chips and salsa.  I ordered a taco combination plate for my meal and the tacos were excellent.  They also have the best tamales in the world, or so my girlfriend says.  We will be going back very soon!
