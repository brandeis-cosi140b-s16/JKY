Wedding Anniversary Dinner
we didn't make reservations and there was a convention in town, but the hostess seated us almost immediately.
she was friendly & sat us cordially
our busser greeted us & offered us drinks & brought us chips & salsa (salsas were very yummy - they brought us three types but my wife & I had our favorites)
our server came by very promptly & was very friendly to us
she guided us through the menu & answered all of our questions thoroughly
we ordered the Tortilla Soup & Green Corn Tamale Appetizer, she also brought us a complimentary app - a Blue Corn Crusted Plantain, which all were excellent. Extremely flavorful & perfect temps & presentations
we ordered the Confit Duck Chilaquiles & Carne Asada Quesadilla
The chilaquiles were perfect, layered well, with bountiful amount of ingredients & heated throughout, duck was flavorful & tender
The quesadilla was full of ingredients & crispy. perfectly cooked & delicious
we were full because we ate every single bite but we wanted to at least taste the dessert & take some home - our server(who was phenomenal) bought us dessert. we opted for the Pastel Rufina - puff pastry with cream cheese chocolate chunks & fresh berries - we took one bite & realized we were not leaving until we finished EVERY bite...needless to say -it was over the top & extremely delicious.
Our server went above & beyond for us & treated us very sweetly & gave us awesome service
Thank you Border Grill, for making our special day, even more so
