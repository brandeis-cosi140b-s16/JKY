I went to Chayo with one of my girlfriends last night and I couldn't have had a more enjoyable experience. The entire staff was very tentative and nice! 

We ordered the Puncho Villa drinks to start which were absolutely delicious. They had jalape√±o tequila and grapefruit juice...sweet, spicy and different. Yum! The Don Margarita was also very tasty! We had the chips and salsa/guacamole, the chicken flautas, the ahi tuna, and for dessert the tres leches. Everything was prepared, presented and tasted wonderfully! On top of that, the atmosphere is great! I will definitely be back time and time again. Thank you for a wonderful time Chayo! :)
