So glad we went here after driving passed this place 100's of times. Trusting my fellow Yelpers & their reviews, my husband and I went there last night. We were seated right away and as soon as we sat down, the waitress gave us our menus & took our drink orders. The waitress was amazingly nice & we were sung to by a father-and-son mariachi band. The food was amazing and the homemade tortillas were so good that we bought 1/2 dozen to take home & have with our leftovers. The food portions were also perfect, leaving us a little taste for the next morning.  Since we live down the street from here, I can definitely see this becoming a regular spot for us.
