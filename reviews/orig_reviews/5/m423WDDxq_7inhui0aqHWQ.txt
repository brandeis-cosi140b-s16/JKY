I pretty much deem Border Grill the best Mexican restaurant in Vegas. Open for brunch, lunch, and dinner. Food is always great. And service is always exceptional.

I have never had even a slightly so-so experience at Border Grill. Everything has always been fantastic here. And that's over the course of a few years and at all times of the day.

Personally, I prefer to eat outside on the patio (which overlooks the pool area). And you can't go wrong with choosing a drink or entree off the rotating list of specials.

The various margaritas and mojitos I have tried have all been great. And my favorite standard menu item is the chile relleno. Absolutely one of the best chile rellenos I've ever had anywhere.

And be sure to check out their brunch menu. The entree offerings are interesting and flavorful. And seriously some of the best (and biggest) cinnamon rolls ever.

I also really appreciate the fact that they have a locals VIP club. When you join, you get a discount card for 15% off your meal every time you visit and you receive various special offers via email. You gotta like Strip restaurants that offer some locals love.
