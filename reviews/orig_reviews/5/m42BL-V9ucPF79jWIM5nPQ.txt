We ate like Kings (or Pigs?) in Vegas and this was probably one of, if not THE favorite of the weekend.  And it was the absolute cheapest - score!

Its a tiny sit-down restaurant and for lunch they have a full menu, combined with a quick menu. We ordered chicken and beef tacos with kimchee and a beef burrito (they were out of pork the day we were there).

After we ordered, they delivered complimentary homemade chips, salsa, and guacamole to the table.  Their 'tap' water is individual bottled water and we got a can of soda (living it up - since we stopped drinking soda almost 2 years ago).  

The tacos were very good - the beef being a bit better than the chicken. I really wish we could have tried the pork.  The burrito was huge and had tons of mexican rice, lettuce, and maybe even cheese. We filled up our burritos/tacos with some of the spicy sauces they brought to our table.

When we got our bill, we nearly fell over - it was just under $11.  We nearly died - so cheap for so much good food!
