Great to see a true "mom & pop" establishment and not a Corporate America chain restaurant is now the top rated local restaurant in Las Vegas!

I love Chinese fried rice and KoMex's house fried rice is the tastiest I've ever eaten.  Also loved the the tacos and burritos made with marinated Korean beef!  Please note this is not fast food but it is GREAT food and each dish is made to order.
