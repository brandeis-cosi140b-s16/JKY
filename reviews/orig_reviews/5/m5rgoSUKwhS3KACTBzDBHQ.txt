This was the second time my partners and I have visited Fatboy. Our initial visit resulted in full bellies and big smiles! 

This time we actually drove out of our way to experience this dining masterpiece! Once again we were met with great service, friendly smiles, and exceptional food.

I am a glutton for punishment so I once again decided to have a double monster boyger with cheese and bacon. This time however I added an egg! If your are faint of heart do not attempt to eat this entire burger, as it should (could) be shared. 

This tiny little restaurant has quite possibly the best burger I have ever eaten. Maybe someday I'll try one of the other items on the menu. I'm sure they are yummy as well'
