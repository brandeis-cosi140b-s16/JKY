I have been there four times, and I love it.  It's authentic, regional cooking with a creative twist.  I always get a shredded chicken and tortilla casserole that is amazing.  

The prices a somewhat higher than other non-hotel related restaurants.  Guess what, you are in a hotel.  Hotel restaurants will always cost more money due to the higher overhead.  

The staff were attentive.  Last time, we had a very unattentive server.  This time, we were blessed with an exceptional server.  We appreciated the experience and the food.
