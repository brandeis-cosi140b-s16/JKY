It was my first experience at Green Dacha eatery and surely won't be my last. I joined a few friends who had been before so I let them do all the ordering.
15 minutes later, I was glad I left the fate of my taste buds in their hands. I can't say what the dishes were, but I don't think I need to -- everything was amazing. The meats were cooked to savory perfection and the accompanying breads/sauces were the perfect compliments. Well, the chicken kebab was great!!!
The waitstaff were very cordial and accommodating. Most importantly, their timing on bringing out dishes was impeccable. Just when every one was finished picking on the course at hand, the next one was magically being placed on the table!
Will be back for sure!
