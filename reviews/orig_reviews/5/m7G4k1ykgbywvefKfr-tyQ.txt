I don't really crave food like I used to, but since I went to Jaburrito with my friend Ife I've been obsessed with it. 
Jaburrito's thing is sushi burritos. For those of you who don't enjoy raw fish they do have chicken, steak and cooked fish. They have burritos that have names or you can just create your own. Which I suggest you do. You can also make it a bowl or nachos. 
It's an assembly line situation. You go down the line and tell them what you'd like in your burrito. What I like in my burrito is I start with the traditional seaweed paper and sushi rice. For my protein choice I pick raw salmon and tempura shrimp. Next, you move onto sauces. If you are unsure of a sauce you can always ask to sample it. I like the poke sauce and the chipotle mayo. Last, you move on to veggies and things. I like to add guacamole, cream cheese, cucumbers, and roasted corn. Jaburrito has a super sweet machine that presses the burrito all together. That's it! You have a fabulous and tasty burrito.

I wish they had a location closer to me, but it's so good it's worth the drive. If you like sushi and burritos Jaburrito is a must try!!!
