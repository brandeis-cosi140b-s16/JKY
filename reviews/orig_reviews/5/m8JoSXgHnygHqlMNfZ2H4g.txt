I love love this place. It is the best Mexican food I have found in Vegas. Its not like down and dirty San Diego Mexican food but it does the trick. 

Love coming on the weekends when they have some live music. Its a 1 man band on his piano, but non the less I love it. Little kids tend to get up and dance the night away. It is a good family place where we can come as a family and mommy can drink margaritas and daiquiris. 

They have good lunch specials for around $10 found on the back of the menu. They also have great Fideo soup. The shrimp cocktail is good as well. 

I tried the oysters one time and no bueno. I guess i should have known better than to order them at a Mexican restaurant. They skip the fixins like the horshradish, etc and just give you plan ol lime. 

The steak dishes are great and beef tacos are the bomb diggity. And of course rice and beans with everything!

Make sure to grab a sucker on the way out cause they are the best.
