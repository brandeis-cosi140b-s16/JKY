There should be diamonds above the stars! The food was excellent the service was top notch and the prices were very reasonable for the portions given nobody could fit desert after the meal. It was our first time visiting we had 17 people in our group and as all Mexicans trying out a Mexican Restaurant we are very picky and have high expectations. This is true Authentic Mexican food and everyone in our group was very pleased. They had one drawback, they do not sell Alcohol  but allow you to BYOB with limitations! :) the atmosphere was good very clean and the staff was super fast and organized. Again if only they had diamonds this restaurant would be on top. It's worth the drive no matter how far you are for us we will definitely return next time we are in the area.
