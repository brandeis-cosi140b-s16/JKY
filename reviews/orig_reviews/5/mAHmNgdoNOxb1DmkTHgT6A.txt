Hands down one of the best Happy Hours in town! I can kick myself twice for procrastinating writing this review as I've been at least 10 times! I can honestly say that I've consistently experience five star customer service each and every time! For starters you can't go wrong with almost anything on the menu! Everything is freshly prepared and made so good! The happy hour house margaritas will kick your but! The fact that I don't have to drive allll the way down to the strip to enjoy a great happy hour is seriously a plus! This place is on my top happy hour list in Summerlin followed by kona grill! The freshly made guacamole is amazing and you can have them make it hot if spicy is your thing! Quesadillas are amazing!! The ahi tuna tacos are a knock out! And lastly the ceviche is probably some of the best I've had! I shall continue to dine here and refer many of my friends and family!
