The customer service is unparalleled to any other Mexican restaurant I've been to. Their happy hour is 11-6 which is an alcoholic's haven...not saying that's me, but I truly enjoy this place. If you are ready to indulge in light Mexican cuisine try their Pork Adobada taco or the Carne Asada Nachos, by the way... Happy hour food prices are amazing! They even have a healthy side option such as the orange cucumber salad. The point is, this place is a must especially during happy hour.
