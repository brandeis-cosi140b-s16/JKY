We are so excited that there is a neighborhood bar to go to besides John Cutters! I don't have a penis, don't gamble nor do I play golf-yet I get great service unlike the "sister restaurant" next-door ... Ronald and Rheanna are such professional and friendly bartenders who are all we could ever hope for!!! Manager Steve is great also. People who complain about food have so many other places to go within a five mile radius - happy trails to you all! We are very content at Toros. The happy hour is great-I hope they keep it !!!
