I always forget how great of a spot this place is for happy hour. However, when we went last week, happy hour ended at 6pm instead of 7pm like it says on their website (please update this or change it back to 7pm for those of us who get off work at 5).

Their grilled shrimp and guacamole tostada bites are the best ($8 during HH) and where else can you get seared ahi tuna for $8 during HH? The portions are pretty good too. Also, you can't go wrong with their complimentary corn bread. It has real pieces of corn in it and is delicious! I don't think I've ever had anything here that I didn't like.

Their chambord margarita and patron fruzion frozen margaritas are great too!
