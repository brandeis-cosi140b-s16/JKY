This was restaurant recommended to me many times from friends and coworkers.

I was invited for lunch by a coworker and was brought here.

Walking into the restaurant you're immediately transformed into another world with all the decorations it really adds to the look and feel of the interior that's fun, festive, and makes one pause to take a moment to soak it all in.

The menu alone is just as fun with many delicious offerings.

They start us off with our drinks and chips, salsa and some refried beans!

Our meal came out much quicker than anticipated!

The portions were great, the food was incredible.

I'm now gonna jump on the bandwagon and let other people know about this place! 

Bon appetit!
