This is an individual person inside a gas station pumping out big delicious plates of food for extremely reasonable prices. The counter top outside of his shop is a nice faux stone that makes the whole place feel more like home. There is one drawback: CASH ONLY! Dont catch yourself off guard and have to use the ATM for a $2.50 fee on a $4.50 burrito purchase. All prices include tax.
