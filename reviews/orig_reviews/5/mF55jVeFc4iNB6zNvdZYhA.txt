Me and my husband decided to eat here for our 4th of July dinner. We got to meet the manager, who was very pleasant as well as the chef (who actually knows what he is doing, excellent food all around).

Our bartender Omar was very attenative, and I never had to ask for a drink refill or chip/salsa refill (he just refilled it without me having to say anything). 

I had some amazing chicken tacos. Their food is organic, non-GMO, and free range. If you are a vegetarian or a vegan, there is stuff on the menu for you.

For dessert, I recommend the churros, fried ice cream, or the flan (all of which are to die for). I'm not kidding, I love churros, and when I go to Disneyland that is one of my favorite things about the place, but these churros were even better than Disneyland's!

To me the price is very affordable, and I hear that they are half off (everything) on Mondays, so I plan on returning to try the rest of the desserts out ;).
