Wahoo's Fish Tacos is awesome and it's a great place to game with an awesome environment for lunch as well. But let's talk about an unsung hero, Tammy.

Is Tammy the best? The short answer is yes. The long answer is that Tammy is so god damn dope that you can't get her through an airport without being charged with a felony.

She's so fly she flaps 100 wings.
She's so sick, Jerry's Kids send her their donations.

But don't take my word for it, here are what some others had to say.

"Every time I sprint while filming a movie, I imagine I'm running toward Tammy, that's why it looks so awesome." - Tom Cruise

"I originally learned how to dance to impress Tammy. I'm glad it launched my career but I'd trade it all if Tammy would just call me back." - John Travolta

"I invaded Ukraine because I heard that Tammy was vacationing there. I was wrong. No regrets." - Vladimir Putin
