Aunt Chiladas hosted the latest Yelp event and what an event it was. The food was excellent. i was especially partial to the tamales...ate several. the chips and salsa at each table were excellent as well. the margaritas from the bar were nice and sweet/salty, just the right ratio. 

we'll definitely check them out again for their regular menu!
