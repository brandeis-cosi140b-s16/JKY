Not your average Mexican food! Very high and upscale quality! The main mahi tacos are to die for!! To drink, I had strawberry cinnamon agua fresca and it was soo good! The tortillas and chips are all made from scratch! The chipotle mango sauce was also mouth watering! The ambience and the service was also great! Keep in mind the prices are a bit high, but I did enjoy the fine dining experience! Will be definitely coming back!
