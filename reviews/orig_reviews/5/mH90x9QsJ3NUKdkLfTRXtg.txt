I started writing this review months ago and have noshed here several times...so why am I just getting around to it now,  you ask. I guess the words I would use to describe the fare here just elude me. Yo Rita's is just transcendent! Everything (pertaining to the food) is flawless. Taste, quality ingredients, flavor profiles, creativity, and presentation  all exceed my expectations.

On my most recent visit, I ordered the velvet underground which consisted of beets, goat cheese, I believe arugula and some other tasty things. It was delicious but the beet/goat cheese combination is a little played out. On the other hand, it has great flavor and they do up perfectly at Yo Rita's. The other taco I had was the asparagus tempura - Divine! It was paired with ponzu, ginger mayo, mushrooms and what really gave it that Ummph was The toasted black sesame seeds, those tiny things pack so much goodness!

JB ordered his go-to, the chorizo (he'll order anything that has a fried egg on it) and the trout per our servers suggestion. He was pleased with both and happy he took the advice.

The only area that has room for improvement would be service -  it's not terrible but it certainly has its issues, but when the food is consistently amazing I'm inclined to overlook lacking service.
