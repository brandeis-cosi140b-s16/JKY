This is my fav place to eat at while in Vegas.  LOVE LOVE LOVE.  The salsa bar is awesome, and the fajitas are incredible (I get the shrimp).  The food is great here, the service is also perfect, and I love the atmosphere as well.  Rarely have waited for a table either.  Usually play poker at the hotel, then walk over for dinner.  Highly recommend.
