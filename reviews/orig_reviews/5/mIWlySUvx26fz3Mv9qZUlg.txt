From world of mouth via friends, I was looking forward to trying this place. It's a bit out of the way for me, but I found myself in the general area today and thought it would be a perfect time to check it out. We were there at 2 pm, the restaurant was completely empty. I was not deterred based on all the great reviews their N. Decatur location had received. Our waitress was very friendly and helpful on choosing what to order. I naturally wanted to eat everything - but managed to narrow it down to the bulgogi Fusion Chimichanga. Go big, or go home. Right? It was loaded with flavor! My friend tried a trio of meats (pork, chicken, steak) with the Fusion Enchiladas. We both loved our dishes, made even better by the quad of sauces brought to the table. I found the sweet chili, and the Asian style chili sauce to be the best toppings. 

Originally I had meant to order the biggest thing, and take a good portion home for my husband to try. (He was very jealous that we had gone without him.). But, I found myself inhaling the chimichanga and ended up just taking home the butt end of it. Sorry Hubs! I look forward to coming here again soon and trying more things. I have to add that my friend is quite particular in what she does and doesn't like, and she really loved her meal. 

 KoMex Fusion lives up to its hype. If you have schizophrenic taste buds like mine, you'll love this place. Sweet, spicy, salty, savory....yummmmm.  I can't wait to come back!
