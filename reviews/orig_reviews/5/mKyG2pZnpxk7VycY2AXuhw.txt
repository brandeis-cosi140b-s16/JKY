Excellent food and service. The patio is excellent seating. The three taco deal is a good deal for $13.50. I told the server (Caitlin) to bring  me her three favorite tacos and she chose excellently. I had the Carnitas -- smoky and spicy, Island shrimp -- sweet and sour, and  a breaded fish taco that was excellent.the house margarita is good but they have a huge selection of margaritas and tequila. Excellent grub and value. Do it!
