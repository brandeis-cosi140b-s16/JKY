Met up with the gang for a farewell to friends dinner, about 15 of us in all. Isaac our waiter handled us with style. The food was fabulous, I had the spinach enchildas which I've only had at one other place , amazing!  We shared two plates of nachos that looked like a volcano of cheese,chips and jalapeno goodness! There was so much food that everyone of us took a to go box couldn't eat another bite we were all so full! Of course I couldn't wait and dug back into my box later that night, to make sure it didn't disappear of course. I will definitely go back, but having dessert first to make sure I have room!
