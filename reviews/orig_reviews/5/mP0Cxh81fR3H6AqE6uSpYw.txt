We ordered delivery today and it was delicious. I had the eggs Benedict scramble and some sausage and pineapple pancakes. All came in 45 min and nice and hot. My only complaint would be that there wasn't enough hollandaise sauce but I thought it was great! It was also very reasonably priced. I will definitely call again.
