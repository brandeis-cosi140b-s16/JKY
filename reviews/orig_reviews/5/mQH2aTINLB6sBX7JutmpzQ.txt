Border Grill at Mandalay Bay was awesome! By that I mean we were only in Vegas two days and we ate there twice. Good, fresh ingredients, quality Mexican food. The weekend brunch was so good and a great deal - like an all you can eat buffet but better because it is prepared to order. There are about 15 small plates on the menu and you can try as many as you want. They were all excellent. We will definitely go back anytime we are in Vegas. Great view from the top patio overlooking the Mandalay pools.
