Being a Mexican native I was impressed by the food at this joint. This place has no gimmicks, it does not want to impress you with pictures of beaches or palm trees or coronas to make you think you're in a beach in Mexico, it's bottom-line no bull great Mexican food. I've been to this place about five times, by myself, work colleagues, and even clients and everyone always leaves happy from this place... My recommendation: the steak tacos are out of this world and a "raspado" for dessert is heaven.

Summary: Fast, good service, and food is amazing!
