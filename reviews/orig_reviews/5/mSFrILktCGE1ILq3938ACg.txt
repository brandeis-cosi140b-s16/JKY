pollo a la quesa crema, is all the spanish you need to know if you roll up into this joint... it is and will forever be the best version of a "chimichanga" you will ever put into your mouth...

never mind the amazing salsa/chips/and bean dip combo that they start you off with, that is just warming up your pallet for the main...

the p.a.l.q.c as i like to call it for short must have been what they used to sacrifice to the the aztec gods back in the old days... because this thing is just that good... think traditional deep fried chimichanga meets  
the stairway to heaven. the chicken they put in it is cooked and pulled to the perfect size and texture, some places get huge chunks that totally ruin the dish, now the best part is the cheese and the creamy jalepeno sauce that they cover the entire thing with... probably doubling the calories right there. but honestly if you are ordering something deep fried in the first place calories are not your main concern... i have been to los olivos about 50 times in my life and never personally ordered anything else... its just not necessary...
