I'm SOOOOO sad that we do not live close to any of their locations anymore!!!! But that definitely does not stop us from coming in to get our Mexican-food fix!!! We have had all sorts of tacos in many different places (cities, states, etc.) and my bf and I STILL cannot find a place that beats Los Tacos. It's literally mind-boggling how good they are. Their service is another aspect of this place that we love. It's always so genuine and I swear, there has been a handful of times where we have gotten something for free. Be it free chips and salsa, free "extra quesadilla they accidentally made" or free taco that they feel like they need to give us because they made us wait a whole four minutes for our order in the drive through. All of the out of town folk that we have taken to this place are all literally floored and they come from places that are heavily populated with awesome Mexican-fare, so you know this place is DELICIOUS!
