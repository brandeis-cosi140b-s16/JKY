I loved this place but it may be because I love Asian Fusion places. I have to admit the only thing that we had that was fusion were the tacos. Otherwise it was straight up sushi which was good but a little overpriced for how uncreative it was. I want to try other dishes next time! 

The server we had was excellent. She let us chill out in between ordering for each course, checked in just enough without bothering us too much, and constantly had our waters filled. The cocktails were excellent - I loved my frozen margarita. 

Plus, the decor is great. It's a good mix of modern and southwestern prints and color without being too tacky or busy or cold. Price is on point for what you experience!
