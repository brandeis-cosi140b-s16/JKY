I made my second trip here over the weekend, though a little hesitant seeing as it was noon on a Saturday.  The line was a little long, but moved suprisingly fast.  The concept is great, and the prices are well worth what you get.  Having just finished a hike I felt I could down a 3 pack for tacos ($4.50) and probably could have, but I cut myself off at 2 1/2.  The tacos have a unique mix of cabbage, onion, beans, (and more) that may not sound like they go with a taco, but when all put together they do.  The outdoor seating could be not so great come summer, but for now it's great and I will definately be back again!
