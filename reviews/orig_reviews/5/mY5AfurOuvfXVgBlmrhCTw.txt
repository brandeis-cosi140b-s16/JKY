Recently celebrated the end of summer with a large group of kids and adults at Joyride.  The beer was icy cold, the Blood Orange margs were to die for and the food was amazing.  Our server was super attentive and offered great suggestions.  The manager checked in occasionally as our group was so large....appreciated.  Would have taken some pics of the food but it was gone too fast.  We will be back for sure!
