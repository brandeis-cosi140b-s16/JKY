Mmmmm, this has been on my "To Try" for Las Vegas for several months now and we were finally able to make it there over the weekend.  Located in Treasure Island, it was easy to find. 

The ONLY glitch in everything was the fact that we made a reservation at 8:00pm, and arrived at 7:45pm.  The hostess told us they were really busy and we needed to come back at 8pm.  It was said so awkwardly that we didn't feel welcome in the EMPTY bar area, so we went out into the casino again.  Hmph.

Back to 8:00pm.  We were seated and given the absolutely yummy chips and salsa, definitely plus 2 points for presentation.  Then we asked about a tequila flight and the server suggested one to us, plus 2 more points for it not being the most expensive!   We chose the organic margarita as well.

The tequila flight was pretty good and a fun experience.  We ended up pouring one into our margaritas.  Our meal was delicious.  I went with my usual black bean burrito and they nailed it (although, how hard, right?) and my husband went with the carne asada tacos. 

Both of us left drunk and satisfied!
