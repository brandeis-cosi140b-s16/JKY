we went to el encanto at the cave creek location for mothers day this year and last :)
this year i pigged out (lst year surgery)
food was very good and ranged from omlettes made for you as you ordered them, mahi-mahi, made to order waffles-yum!!  
cheese enchilada's (just as good as their carefree location)
fresh squeezed orange & apple juice/cider.
service was really good as waitress mentioned that the orange juice that i ordered to her previously, you can get where the food was and i said i saw that-she didn't hesitate to ask me if she could still get me a glass and i replied yes please :)
i was impressed with that as my food was hot and i didn't want to go back up to the line and wait.
that's service for you!!
the atmosphere also at this certain location has a huge pond with ducks, turtles and birds and is a delight to be there in the morning and have a nice buffett brunch with watching the scenery along with it.
there's nice local shops across the street to visit in addition afterwards.
support our local restaurants and shops!!
