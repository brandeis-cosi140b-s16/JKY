The service is absolutely the best I've had ever in a restaurant. Seriously. The free chips n salsa and grilled onions and peppers sometimes hit the table as I'm being seated. They are very attentive and friendly. 

The food is worth the 20 min drive to get there for me and is the best Mexican food I've had in Vegas and I've ha a lot of Mexican food. My favorite lunch plate is Mulitas and my favorite Jalisco dinner plate is the Pollo Asado with Rajas con Crema. Try it! You won't be disappointed!
