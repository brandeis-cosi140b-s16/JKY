We went because of the coupon we got in our mail, but were glad we did. We used to go to Buzz BBQ when it was there, and based on the amount of fellow diners joining us, Buzz can't blame their lack of crowd on the location.  Juan's was packed for a random weekday.
I got the carne asada chimichanga, the meat was very good, I just didn't realize it was going to be served smothered in sauce,  which ruins my favorite part, the crispy shell. But it was still tasty.
My boyfriend had the fork fajitas,  and the meat looked dry, but it was actually very tender, and full of flavor and not dry. He loved his meal!
The staff was very attentive and full of energy!
