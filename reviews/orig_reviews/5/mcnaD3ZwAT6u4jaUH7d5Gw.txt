Best Mexican food in Phoenix.  The restaurant is located in a rough area, but it's worth the risk.  I prefer the Oaxaca's special, without the beans.  While there, order some tortilla's (either corn or flower) to take home.  They're fresh baked, still hot when you get them.  This isn't a restaurant to sit around and socialize with friend's. It's located in a cinder block building with bars on the windows. Also, they do not serve alcohol.  Try to get there while the sun is still shining. If working near downtown Phoenix and going to Carolina's for lunch, get there EARLY! The place is packed for lunch.
