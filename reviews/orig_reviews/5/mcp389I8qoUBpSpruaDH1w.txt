Most flavorful chimichanga I've ever had! the carne adovada and the green chilies were perfect. very spicy! even though I was stuffed, I couldn't stop eating the amazing food. the margaritas aren't cheap, but you can actually taste the tequila in them, unlike most Mexican food places I've been to. overall, great good and great service. I'll definitely be back again.
