Best Tortillas Ever!!  Whenever I am in the vicinity of downtown Phoenix, I make it a point to stop by Carolina's.  Try their 3-way burro, and make it a foot long.  It is awesome.  I also make sure to bring home a dozen of their HUGE tortillas.

The location is horrible, and the place looks a little scary, but you will always find local police, business men & women, and even celebrities eating there.

It's the best hole in the wall Mexican food in the history of the world!
