My Mexican friend was in dire need of tacos after a night of drinking and dancing. She found the place on Yelp so upon recommendation, we walked here as a group to get some tacos. My husband and I shared the 3 taco plate, one with shredded beef and carne asada for the 2 other tacos. It came with rice and refried beans. We topped with mild green sauce, onions, and cilantro. My friend and her husband ordered the same but with different meat, and a plate of the sopes and nachos. Wow. For the price and location, this place did not disappoint. The food was fresh, the food was quick, and it was not a bad price at all. Easy to find a place to sit and right outside, it's a little hole in the wall place within a center of other foods but it's easy to find out why this place has such great ratings. It's authentic and all around delicious food with reasonable pricing. I would definitely hit this place up again while in Vegas!
