Wow I thought I Would have never have eaten tacos as good as in Mexico I'm a cook from L.A. and these are better than any tacos in L.A. even king taco! They taste identical to Tacos el gordo from Tijuana the al pastor is beyond delicious and asada is amazing I would give it 10 stars if I could. Don't go to chipotle that place is a joke and it's beyond expensive! The only bad thing is that o live in L.A. and they are here.
