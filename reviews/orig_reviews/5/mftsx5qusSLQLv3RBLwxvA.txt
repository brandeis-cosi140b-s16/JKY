So we came here after finding out Rokerij doesn't serve the new Mexican food anymore. My Lil Sis was in town and the rellenos were a must ! My Mom, both Sisters and I came on our girls day after the art museum and shopping. It was the perfect way to end the day ! Our food was amazing !!!!!! The enchiladas and rellenos were out of the world !!! All I wanted in life at that moment ! I also tried the carne adovada and cordon bleu, they were very good also. We had the skewers thinking that were like the rokerij version, but they weren't, still good though. We finished with the flan and sopapillas. The flan was really good. I am not crazy about flan, but I really enjoyed theirs. The sopapillas were good, not authentic, but still very good. I appreciated the density even though it isn't how I have always known them to be.
