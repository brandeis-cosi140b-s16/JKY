The BEST Bean & Cheese Burritos we have ever tried. My husband is still talking about how fresh and tasty the tortillas alone are (and he has always favored his Mama's). I had Shredded Beef Tacos and they were great! This is a very small establishment and message on glass says "We specialize in To Go orders. Space inside is limited." Worth the time you wait for food(not long. we went on CincoDeMayo and only waited 20 minutes for a large ToGo order.), money you spend and gas to get there. Definitely will go back again and again.
