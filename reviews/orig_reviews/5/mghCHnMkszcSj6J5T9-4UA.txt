We went here for the first time yesterday and it was great! Don't make the mistake of thinking that this is a Mexican restaurant, it's not. They specialize in Nachos (obviously) but they have a little bit of everything. We only split the chicken enchilada nachos, but the were sooooo good! Everything that came out of the kitchen looked so great we can't wait to go. P.S. - ask for Kim. . .she's super sweet and a great waitress!
