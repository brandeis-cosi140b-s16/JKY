Beautifully designed restaurant inside and out. The Margaritas are the best! They are very tasty and strong! I had the Naughty Maggy (Cadillac Margarita) and a Mango on the rocks, both so good. To eat, I had the Anna's Pollo. It is a chicken dish, I wish I would of taken pictures but it was too good. Overall experience was great. Good food, good drinks, amazing ambiance!!
