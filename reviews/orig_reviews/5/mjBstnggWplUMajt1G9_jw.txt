I've been here twice and had the same dish both times because it is so delicious. I'm sure everything else is amazing but I don't know if I'll ever make it past the Carne Adovada, delicious tender pork in a red adobo sauce. My husband has a similar problem with the stacked enchiladas (Christmas style with red and green sauce), it's the only dish he's had in his three visits. Be careful not to completely gorge yourself on the complimentary chips and salsa (which is roasted to perfection, and good enough to drink), as the portions are generous. The restaurant seems to walk the line between fancy and casual. Great date night spot!
