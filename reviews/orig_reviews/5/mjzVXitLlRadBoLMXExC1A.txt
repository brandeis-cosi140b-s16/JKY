First time... had the stacked enchiladas. Plenty of spicy goodness there. That being said, come hungry and ready to light your mouth up a bit for this one. How does it rate? Great NM style food. Excellent service. Typical ambiance. All in all, a winner in my book. Oh, and if you're a Tequila fan (I'm not... long story), they have well over 100 different types!
