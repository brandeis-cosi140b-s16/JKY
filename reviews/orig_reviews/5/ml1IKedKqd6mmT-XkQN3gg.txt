If I lived near this restaurant I would be there all the time. They make the most refined yet homey sauces (especially the camarones culichi, or shrimp in green poblano sauce is addictive), serve freshly fried puffy tortilla chips, delicious ceviche tostadas on the house, and perfect shrimp tacos. The atmosphere is warm, festive and neighborly, no pretensions and the prices reflect this. There is a full bar, huge draft beers with lots of lime, and very hospitable service. I haven't enjoyed such a wide array of flavors, amazing Mexican style seafood outside of Mexico, even in San Diego which comes close.
