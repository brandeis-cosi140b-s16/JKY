Great place. If you enjoy authentic ethnic foods, especially of a Spanish/Mexican influence, (or in this case, Dominican) you'll enjoy this place. The food is fresh and flavorful. I've been here about 6 times and have never been disappointed. The tacos are excellent, the Dominican Nachos are different and delish - been very pleased with food quality, flavors, service and prices. Have taken friends here and they like too.
Give it a try - it is a casual, colorful experience.
