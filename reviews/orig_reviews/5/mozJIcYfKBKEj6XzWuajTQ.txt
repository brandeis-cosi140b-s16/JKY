I have been here many times and the service is always excellent. They bring out chips salsa, bean dip and grilled onions to start. I usually eat here for lunch and go with a special. Lately it has been the grilled chicken taco salad. Yum! They are always on top of drink refills. Best of all they are very reasonable priced for the quality of food and service. Don't forget to try the signature dish as well!
