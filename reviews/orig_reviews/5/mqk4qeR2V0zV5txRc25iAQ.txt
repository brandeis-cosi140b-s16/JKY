My uncle told me about this place from a foodnetwork show with Guy Fieri.  This place was really good and the prices were reasonable. I got there on the day it was 114 degrees after a 4 hour drive.  The Corona Light was ice cold.  The street style tacos were so good. Lots of flavor and great toppings.  Not over done.  I also had the nachos, and they were so good.  The chips were homemade and crispy.  I would recommend this spot.  Its not too far off of the strip and its worth it.
