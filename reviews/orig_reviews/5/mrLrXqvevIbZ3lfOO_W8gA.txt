I'm giving this place 5stars because I had a great time. I went to Vegas this past weekend for the canelo fight. So it was very packed, I'm talking about an hour to two hour wait. I have never had so much fun waiting to be seated everyone outside was drinking and some were dancing to the musicos. While waiting i had a michelada which is not my drink of choice but i was treated so i complied. When we were finally seated I ordered the mojarra frita which was sooo good and buttery. Then my cuzns and I where bought 2 buckets of beer and a bucket of flowers which was very sweet. 
We came back the next day because of how much we liked it. It's a must now every time we come to Vegas!!
