We started our evening with the margaritas which were made with taj√≠n salt foam, fresh squeezed lime and agave nector, and it just got better from there.

The guacamole was rich and chunky. The tacos were all great, but our favorite was the pork al pastor. The meat was marinated with achiote and chipotle and covered on avacado cream. The pineapple was a nice touch. 

Our server Daniel was fantastic. Great sense of humor and a lot of fun. 

This was a great surprise after arriving to the airport hours earlier. I would highly recommend it!
