We have been looking for a new Mexican Cantina since our favorite place  changed their menu. 
The first thing we noticed was the ample parking . This is a real rare find in Phoenix and makes PAZ a really appealing choice all in itself. The decorum   was well done and the presentation was aesthetically pleasing. We ordered the queso  as an appetizer and really enjoyed that not only did it have a zesty flavor , but also kept the same  creamy consistency throughout the time it took us the finish. As an entree we ordered  the pork belly tacos and the carnitas tacos. The  pork belly was lightly fried and definetely a future favorite. The cilantro and lime  really complimented the carnitas well. We ordered the house margarita which was strong and well made . Definetely worth the price.
