This is by far the best Mexican food on this side of the Valley and maybe even the whole valley. The food is delicious and fresh, the service is excellent and the prices are GREAT! I've brought real Mexicans to this place and they love it. Man vs Food didn't even need to come and plug this place, it's great either way.
