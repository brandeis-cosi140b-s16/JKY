On vacation from England, we wanted some great local Mexican food so I turned to Yelp. Saw this place and the excellent reviews so I decided to go. Indeed this is right next to the largest gentlemans club in the world but don't let that put you off. The food and service was amazing. We ordered the guacamole and was not expecting our server Tiffany to make it from scratch right on the table. The enchiladas were also fantastic. Chef Paco then came out to make sure the food was good and explained everything is made fresh which is why it tastes so good. Would totally recommend this place. Best to do what I did. Just tell your wife and friends your going out for Mexican and then see their faces when you pull up at a gentlemans club, priceless.
