I love Macayo's! I try New Mexican places... and I always come back. Chips N Salsa is the best! You know that you are from Vegas if you have a love for Macayo's and their TCTs . You get plenty of food for your dollar. My favorites are the Tostada Del Mundo, Chimichangas, and the fajitas are my favorite.. also try the fried ice cream and the tortilla soup, not in that order though. All the other so so reviews, they're not from here
