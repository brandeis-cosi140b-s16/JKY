When I moved to Charlotte my moving company absolutely raved about this place and said I must try it, when a friend was moving to Charlotte he said "I want to live as close to Cabo Fish Taco as possible!" So I figured this must be a pretty great place to eat. 

Not only is the food great, the service is really good too. I've been to some "classy" places in Charlotte only to have to experience tarnished by poor service skills. Cabo Fish Taco has it all going on! 

Its been two days since I've been there and I am already CRAVING more beer battered shrimp tacos. With family coming to town for Thanksgiving I think I might have to find an excuse to take them here.
