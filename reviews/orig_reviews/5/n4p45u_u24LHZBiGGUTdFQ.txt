I know this is redundant, but the spicy pork tacos are out of this world.  The meat is slow cooked and shredded in front of you, while the cook behind the counter slightly fries two corn tortillas and preps the taco for the meat.  The contents are the complimented with a dressing similar to the cilantro ranch served at Cafe Rio.  There are also other vegetables and a spicy chile sauce to boost.  For $2, you absolutely cannot go wrong.
