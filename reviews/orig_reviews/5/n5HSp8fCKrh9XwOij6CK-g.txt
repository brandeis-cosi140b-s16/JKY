I would consider Phoenix to be one of the worst towns on the planet for Mexican food with the exception of Rosita's Place, which I think to be the best place on the planet.  I was living in Phoenix back in the mid-80's and pining for LA-style Mex when I came across a review for this funky place on Buckeye Road.  I'm tellin' ya, my life changed after a single meal there.  No longer would I say that Phoenix had no good Mexican restaurants.  Time and life has taken me to different places and I now live thousands of miles away, but when I get a long layover at Sky Harbor, I'm happy, because it means I will have time for a meal at Rosita's.  My personal favorites are the red AND green chile, so I usually order the half and half, unless I'm going to be in town a few days.  The chips and salsas are the best in the US.   I LIKE the area that Rosita's has moved to.  After dinner some night, take a drive through the trailer park in back; it's like a time warp into the '50's and there are some really cool old Lucy and Desi trailers in that park.
