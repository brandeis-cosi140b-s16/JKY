Fabulous...more than affordqable for the quality of food and the dining experience.  I felt like I should have paid more and I seldom feel that way.  

The queso was ok and I will pass on my nest trip.
The Ahi Tuna Tostada is a must have.
Filet Rellano was the shining star of the meal.
Tamale was excellent.

The best Mexican fusion that I've ever had and much better than the restaurants on the strip that try and fail at the same cuisine.
