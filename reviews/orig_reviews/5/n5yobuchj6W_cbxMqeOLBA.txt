We have gone to Lulu's twice now and have been happy with the food both times.
I had the fajitas and shrimp tacos and they were very good.The folks working there were very nice and helpful.  A touch on the pricier side but, like others have stated that the food was fresh. Being a small business owner I understand what it takes to run a business and the cheapest is not always best, In fact it never is!
Definitely will be back for more!
