My first trip to tako, I came by myself on my pre-move homefinding trip at the recommendation of my coworker. As I sat in the small outside bar area, watching the kitchen staff do their thing, I was hoping beyond hope that I would like this place. It was so cute and I love the open kitchen concept.

Thankfully, this was by far the best food I had during that trip, and I thought to myself, "This'll do. This'll do just fine."  The tacos were spectacular. Inventive but more importantly full of flavor, and not incredibly expensive for gourmet tacos.

I came back recently and tried some more tacos (I now find that the Korean tacos and the Al Pastor are my favorite so far), BUT a highlight of my night was the tuna belly guacamole (#2 of the chef specials). So so delicious. A little bit of salty, a little bit of almost sweet, and a lot a bit of umami (I'm not quite sure what umami is but I know it when I taste it!).

Also, try the spicy passionfruit margarita. Sweet but not too sweet, spicy but not too spicy, boozy but not too boozy.

Long story short, tako is amazing, and I plan to be back many times. So glad that there are solid food options in Pittsburgh. Makes me excited to be here :)  (Also, hello Pittsburgh!  I'm new!  Find me good places please :D)
