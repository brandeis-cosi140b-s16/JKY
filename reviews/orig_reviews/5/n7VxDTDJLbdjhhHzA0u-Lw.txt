One of the best Mexican food restaurants in the East Valley.  The only complaint that I have is that they are only open until 2pm.  I brought my fiance there and she swore she would never eat anything made in what appeared to be a tin shack.  It is now one of  her favorite places to grab a Saturday lunch!  I just wish you were open later so we could eat there more than once a week!
