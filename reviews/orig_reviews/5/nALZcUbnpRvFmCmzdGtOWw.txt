Cafe Rio is delicious!  I usually get the fire grilled chicken salad to go.  I get extra chicken and my husband and I can share it.  Their portions are reasonable.  I like this location because they are quick.  The Cafe Rio on blue diamond takes forever so I rarely go to that location because they don't have a sense of urgency.
