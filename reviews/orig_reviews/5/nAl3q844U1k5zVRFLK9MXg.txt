Driving down 16th st sometimes you can smell what they cook, so you HAVE to go inside,  hungry or not. The best on the menu is,  in my opinion, smoked turkey enchilada. Tamales are not the greatest but there are so many other things to choose from. Sitting at the dark bar I got to know many people who go there "all the time" . There is no street sign but they don't need it. The place is just great.
