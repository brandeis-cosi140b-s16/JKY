Since moving here from LA I have hunted Vegas for anything similar to the ever popular Bottomless Mimosa Brunch. This is the closest thing you can get and it just so happens to originate from LA! I recently dined here during their Saturday brunch. They have an amazing brunch menu that serves up "modern Mexican" cuisine with unlimited small plates for $34.99/ person as well as Bottomless Mimosas for an additional $10. Worth every penny! If your appetite and group is big enough you can savor and taste all 16 dishes. Each dish provides enough for 2-3 people to sample. Dishes range from savory and sweet so you can capture the best of both worlds. Few highlights for me were the Chilaquiles, Churro Tots, Egg White Oyster Rockefeller, and The Bacon Jalepeno PBJ which is one of the most interesting dishes to try! Forgot to mention, the delightful sweet empanadas and fruit plate you get as an appetizer prior to getting your food served which was all quite superb! 

Not only do they have bottomless mimosas for $10 but they offer 5 different flavors! My favorite is called The Corazon, which is mixed with blood orange, passion fruit and orange juice. 

Our server was Perry and be did an amazing job making sure my glass of Mimosa was never empty and anticipated the right times to take our next batch of order. The food came out at a reasonable time! Overall experience was excellent! Brought me right back home, best feeling in the world!
