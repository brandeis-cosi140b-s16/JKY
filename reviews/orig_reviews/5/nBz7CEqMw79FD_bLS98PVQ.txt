So happy that yelp helps me decided what I'm going to have for dinner at the last minute! This place was a gift that I stumbled upon while doing a simple yelp search by my new place. Without a doubt; I discovered my new fav Mexican restaurant! 

Nice and clean inside with classic Mexican decor and plenty of seating. 

The service was fast and our server was very smiley. I love a happy server!! Very quick to bring out chips and salsa AND beans! What a treat! Beans with your chips, winner! I split a cheese crisp and shrimp fajitas with my boyfriend. The cheese crisp was a delicious classic and the fajitas were tasty and served on the nice hot plate. 

Will definitely be coming back for more!
