WOW! 

Second time was even better than the first. I had an appetizer and my wife had an entree. Both were excellent. What really made this trip special was our server JJ (Jordan). She was outstanding in every way. Awesome smile and attitude and we really liked her drink suggestions. 

Bottom line is this place rocks and we will return again and again. Props to the owners, management and employees!
