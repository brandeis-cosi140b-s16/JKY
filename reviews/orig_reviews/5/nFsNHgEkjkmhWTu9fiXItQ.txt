Had dinner at The Mission a few nights ago and it did not disappoint. The guacamole was amazing! Seriously maybe the best we've ever had. We were dining with our five-year-old and the waiter was so accommodating in terms of adjusting the spiciness. The pork tacos were great, the Mexican grilled corn was delicious, and the margaritas were perfect. We'll be back!
