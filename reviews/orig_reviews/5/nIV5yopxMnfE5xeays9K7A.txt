I almost never write reviews and certainly not for airport restaurants. But, I was here last week while flying out of Phoenix and I was so impressed! Best huevos rancheros I have ever had. Hands down. I ordered it with the eggs over easy, the corn toritlla and added chorizo. It was amazing - savory, fresh, spicy but not hot. I would make a point of coming back to this place anytime I fly in or out of Phoenix.
