Visiting from CA and our host took us here. I had the the three taco plate with chicken tinga, short rib and conchita pibil. They were all delicious. The service was good and a manager touched our table and gave us a complimentary dessert. My only negative was the bomb beans were under seasoned. This did not ruin my experience however. Would recommend this place! Excellent!
