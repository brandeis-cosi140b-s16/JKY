Went there today for the first time, sooooooo good!  Had the El Flaco Torta...UNbelieveable.  We brought our dog, and they let us eat on the patio (which is a little small, but well shaded!).  They even brought her a bowl of water without us asking!  Their chorizo is greasy but tastes fantastic...best I have ever had. Their drink menu looks very good...will definitely have to go back for happy hour!!
