Consistent quality, high quality, acceptable price, great flavors, stable crew, always clean. What is not to like about this place?

Get a loyalty rewards card punched every time you eat here, you get a free meal after 10 paid meals and all the employees do a chant to celebrate B-) 

Really, what's not to like here?
