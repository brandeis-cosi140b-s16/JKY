Chinese takeout + taqueria + some extra flavors thrown in =

Basically your imagination is the limit: Jerk chicken burrito with an egg foo young quesadilla with Cuban refried black beans and fried rice?
And all served up in a tin foil takeout bowl?
Yes!

Everything was great. The people were super friendly and gave lots of free samples and explanations.

They should totally add soul food to the mix, too. Mmmm macaroni and cheese burrito with rib tip fried rice....

I wish they were near me. I wish they were anywhere - anywhere - except for Arizona.
