Came to Vegas for a bachelorette and all of us being spicy Latinas looking for a much needed spicy hangover remedy.  Came across this restaurant on Yelp with awesome reviews. It lives up to their expectations. We order amazing micheladas and an awesome magoniada. Our server was so attentive and took great care of us ladies. I recommend this place to all, specially out of towners looking for a spicy Mexican Seafood Rest!
