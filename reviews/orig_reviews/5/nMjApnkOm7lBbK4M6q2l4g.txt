Went to this hole in the wall restaurant on a friend's recommendation as well as the superb Yelp rating.  Location is in a strip shopping center and supposedly the interior has been recently updated.  Started off with their fusion bulgogi fries which was very good - covered in cheese and meat.  Followed by their fusion tacos - one of each meat with the bulgogi being my favorite meat.  My wife really enjoyed the fusion burrito with chicken.  The mango/passionfruit unsweetened tea was a bit to sutle for my tastes.  Great food with equally wonderful prices.
