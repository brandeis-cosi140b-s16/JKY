Love this restaurant. My Latina wife and I stumbled upon it, and have since been back twice with family.  We recently had a wedding and took both of our families out to it twice because everyone liked it so much, and the menu was extensive.  You get a good sized meal, and maybe some take home for around $15.  We live in Arizona and New Mexico and check out some of the best Mexican fare restaurants, and not only is this authentic it is also very good.  
Great place for lunch, dinner, and fun for families.  Fun & festive too.
