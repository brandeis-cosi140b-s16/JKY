I am OBSESSED with this place and I bring in people who become obsessed after trying this place. I recommend it to anyone who loves trying new things. I always order the bulgogi chimichanga. ITS A MUST!! 
So much flavor and goodness. The mozzarella was a genius move. Well done, komex. 

Also when you're seated, they serve you complimentary chips and ahmahzing salsa. 

It's a family owned place and they are about the nicest restaurant owners I've met. Excellent service. They'll help you on anything on the menu if you're a first timer.
