Amazing food. We loved it. Service was not good. Wait time was a lot, however, it was all worth it. I highly recommend this place. We went on a Sunday and it was busy still. So I'm not sure what a friday night is like. If you can on a friday, I would hope they have more people who are taking orders and coming to tables.
