Small place, limited menu, however, what they do they do good... YUM, I had all three of the taco's.. excellent... Veggie, Chicken and Short Rib... I really liked them and plan on returning to have them again, then again, their hamburger looked pretty awesome as well.  Nice to find a place different from all the chains... I shall return...
