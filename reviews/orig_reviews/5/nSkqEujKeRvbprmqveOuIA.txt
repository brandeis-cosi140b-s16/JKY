Outstanding. Perfect casino food. The Carne and Estilo Baja were some of the best tacos I've ever had; and I wasn't drunk (which makes everything taste good). Tried it the first night of my stay hearing good things about it. Had to go a second time two days later to make sure I hadn't hallucinated the experience. Nope, freaking heavenly tacos. Of the three food options I tried at this hotel (Red Rock Resort) this was hands down the best.
