YEEEE HAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWW! Komex is opening a location 2 minutes from my house! 1 minute if the wind is blowing from the north and I can smell the wonderful aroma of bulgogi on the griddle! Finally a SW location. They have been teasing me for 2 years. And so close to my home. I'm sure that will be both a blessing and a curse. HELLO BIGGER WAISTBAND!
