Just so you don't think I DON'T like ANYWHERE I eat, here comes a rave review!

Thankfully I G-Mapped my way here. When I pulled into the parking lot-which was predominantly taken by a "Gentleman's Strip Club", I was a little hesitant; wondering if I had made a mistake.  I almost turned around and left, but the rave reviews enticed  me to walk the gauntlet of buzzed men, leaving the club.

Damn am I so glad I did!  Ladies, stick it out, this is one restaurant so worth it! No, it's not a part of the club next door, even though their doors are very close to each other.

The ambiance is class A. But I never care as much about that as the FOOD.
I personally prefer  food that is responsibly raised and organic. Please no extra hormones for me!

I have include a photo of the fact that this restaurant is hep to all that, and proud to show it.

I asked the bartender/waiter (I sat at the bar) what HIS favorite dish was and why. 
"Chipolte Creamy Chicken", he responded.  After telling me about it I was sold. 

Before the meal. the chip basket and three salsas were fantastic. I am soon very picky about chips, and do not like 80% of restaurant  chips. These were great. Salsas were too.

Main meal was dreamy. Veggies were even cooked to (slight al-dente) perfection. And while it had that smokey bite, it wasn't so hot I didn't enjoy it. Spice  level was perfect for me.

What stood out to me though were the beans! Yes, the beans that I usually don't even bother with. I tried a small bite, and MY GOD.... these were almost like my mom used to slow cook all day. But better.

I called him over and praised an item that most people don't even consider. 
"Oh, it's the lard, gotta use real lard", he laughed.

I know this to be true, and boy does it make for flavorful and moist beans. Don't even think about lard-just enjoy.

I can't wait to go back to Vegas so I can stop at this hidden gem once again.
