This is an amazing establishment. It is located on The LinQ. We sat outside, surprisingly it was very comfortable and cool thanks to the misters. It felt as if we were dining inside with air conditioning. We were greeted right away by the server. 

chips and Salsa. Chips were seasoned and somewhat spicy. The salsa was Fresh.

empanada is amazing I definitely recommend it.

I had the Chicken Fajitas. It was an amazing dish. Can't wait to try everything else on the menu.
