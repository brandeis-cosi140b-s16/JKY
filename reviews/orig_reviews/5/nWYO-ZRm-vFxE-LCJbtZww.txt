My girlfriend and I found this place on yelp. We've been coming back ever since. She usually gets the country fried burger and i always try their burgers that are on special. Food is always on point and the service great. If you are looking for a laid back joint with great food, Paradise Valley Burger Co. is the joint to be at!
