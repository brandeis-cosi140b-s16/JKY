Relocated to AZ at the end of 2014, and since have been looking for the best place to get authentic Mexican food.  We have found it!  Today I had the beef burrito, enchilada style, with green chile sauce and rice.  My wife had the taco salad special.  Outstanding!   This is a family business, with very friendly owners.  We will be back regularly, and if you have not tried them, it is your loss.
