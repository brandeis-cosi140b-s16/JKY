I like this restaurant. For one thing, I see a lot of Hispanic folks eating there. The wait staff is friendly and helpful to a degree you don't often luck into. The michelada (it's a mexican tomato beer) is a wonderful way to take beer. We've done four or five trips to this restaurant and both my wife and I have found the food to be excellent every time. They specialize in some sea food dishes if you like Mexican sea food. You get the feeling of dining in Mexico here. Good people, good food, good ambiance. We intend to do our part to keep this place going. It is kind of hidden in the little plaza at the corner of McKellips and Gilbert.
