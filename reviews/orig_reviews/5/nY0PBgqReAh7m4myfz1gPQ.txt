This little unpretentious taco shop is worth the drive. Trust me. Lulu's set's herself apart from other similar restaurants with a tasty salsa bar, perfect homemade tortillas, and the Guadalajara-style, as opposed to the Sonoroa-style, Mexican food most places in the Phoenix area serve. You might want to try to avoid lunch hour as there is often a line out the door!
