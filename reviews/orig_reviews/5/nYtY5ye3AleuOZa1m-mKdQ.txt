I love Tacos El Gordo, its fresh and simple mexican food.    For ordering stand in the line according to the meat you want, you want pork , stand in the line in front of the huge spinning pork meat on a spic.  Steak stand in the steak line, look for the signs.  When its not busy it doesn't matter, but when this place is rocking, the lines are 5-7 people deep, standing in the wrong line cause issues.  

I have had the steak and pork tacos, both are great.   If you are near the Wynn, try this place.
