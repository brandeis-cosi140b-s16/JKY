I fly to Phoenix at least once or twice a year just to eat here!  That's how incredible the food is at Chino's!

I love the different varieties of dishes they have and the fun way they put everything together based on how you like it and how you want it - w/ rice, wrapped in a tortilla, made into a burrito, etc.  It's a great idea - like playing with food.

The best things are the emerald chicken, jade chicken, jen red pork, jerk fried rice, and I absolutely LOVE the beans here...and the funny thing is I really dislike any type of beans...it's crazy how good Chino's is.  One more thing I love here is the chile rellano...it's so tasty...and completely to-die-for!

Not to mention, I LOVE the cookies they make and give away with the meal.  The cookie itself can be sold at a high end gourmet store for more $2-$3 a piece (just imagine cookies 100x  better tasting than Mrs. Field's)

I envy people who live in Phoenix because they have this incredible gem right in town.  This is an awesome find - great "hole in the wall" serving super yummy food (and by the way not like super greasy or oily Chinese).
