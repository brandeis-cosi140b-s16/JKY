Terrific place to see a live show... the venue is smallish and easy to see the stage from everywhere. They even have some raised seating against the wall for people that can't see over the crowd or don't want to stand. Nice to see Phoenix area getting a venue that seems more SF or Seattle and is booking solid bands.
