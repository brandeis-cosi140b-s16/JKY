I love Dicks.

Uhhhh

By this point, I've probably had everything on the menu twice over. There are so many dishes that are both varied to please everyone, and still consistent with what they are going for which is the New Mexican Cuisine. 

Dick's has it all, a quaint and unique atmosphere. It feels like a small eatery you'd find in a downtown of a big city, it's a really fun, dark, kind of sexy place to take a date too. There aren't many better first date locales.

The Pork Chop Chorizo, Roasted Garlic Plate, Red White and Blue Enchiladas, and of course the Carne Adovada are some of the real standouts for me. They serve Chimay on draft, the servers are friendly, and it's got the fun great atmosphere to boot. You owe it to yourself to try it.

I just hate telling people I had Dicks for dinner.
