BEST SALSA + CHIPS in Vegas and CHIPS anywhere I have been in the world. I usually make myself sick on chips + salsa because they are addicting. Their chips are the thinnest you will ever try.
Now the food............. Basically edible but not bad but not good barely too enjoyable.
I have been here 40+ times for chips + salsa and have tried the entire menu for the most part. 
There is a fajita salad which is not bad if you hold the dressing and just put more SALSA on it, The other thing which is a good value and pretty tasty is the mixed grill fajitas. And the Corn Cake appetizer. I advise do not try anything else besides these items unless you want to be disappointed. But the chips + salsa make up for everything.
