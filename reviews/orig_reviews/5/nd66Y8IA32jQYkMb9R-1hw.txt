After having a really bad first impression and writing a review about a month ago we were contacted by Kennedy Turner from Taco Guild and invited us to return. This time things were much different. We walked in and was immediately greated. We decided to sit at the bar and was greeted by a wonderful bartender (forgot her name but she was pregnant). She told us about upcoming events and about the awesome new live music they have on saturdays. We asked for taco suggestions and we got some great ones. We ended up with the Pork Adavado, Thai snapper and the shrimp. They were all amazing.

I decided to update my review because I belive that they were very deserving of it. We will definitely be back and I highly recommend  this place! !!

Thank you Kennedy Turner for taking care of the original issue and going above and beyond to make sure recaptured our business.
