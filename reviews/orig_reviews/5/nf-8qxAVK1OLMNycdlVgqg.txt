Saw this place on Food Network and decided to stop by while we were in town for Spring Training.   

Well I was not disappointed!! Arrived a little after the lunch rush and we were seated as soon as we got in th door. I order the Del Rey torta and it was more then emought foood... it was held together with two giant wooden skewers and came with two handfuls of ruffless chips.  
The took our order and in less then 10 minutes our food was at our table.  We also were served  a red salsa that went get on top of the chips and torta.. 

There was a ton of meat on the torta and not your low quality stuff but good big sliced chunks of pork, nice and thin and lightly breaded milanesa..egg, chorizo, ham, sliced hot dogs, jalepenos, cheese, avocado, onion...etc etc....

The torta bread is some of the best I have had..

on the 2nd visit I had the Arizona and we started with the queso con chorizo and jalepenos toreados....

Torta was just as good as the one from two days before...

The queso con chorizo was enought for 3 people and they gave you quite a bit of chorizo too.

M only complaint would be the jalepenos...as they were not roasted long enough, out of the 6 we got only 3 were roasted the right way and the other three needed at leat 3 more minutes on the grill.... they were still raw and lacked that roasted taste...

But other thent that this place was legit.....

They havr a Monster 5+ pound torta called the King Carlos V.... during our 2nd visit two of them were ordered by another table and our waitress was kind enough to stop by our table to show it to us before dropping it off....  I thought my torts was huge  now this one was HUGE!!! 

Will def be back  when ever I am in the Phoenix area
