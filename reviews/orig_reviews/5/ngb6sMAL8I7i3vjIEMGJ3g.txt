I put as much of a premium on service as I do on food; I won't go back to a place where the wait staff is inattentive or doesn't seem to care. Frank & Fina's has the perfect combination - outstanding food with outstanding service. It's slightly pricier than many Mexican restaurants in town but absolutely worth it. The food is authentic Mexican - no one at our table had even the slightest criticism about their meal, which almost never happens. The restaurant is convenient to anyone on the west side of Las Vegas, and the fact that it's just off the 215 Beltway makes it accessible for those in Henderson, too. A great place.
