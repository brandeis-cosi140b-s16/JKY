!!!!!!! ***  O M G ......So GOOD  ***   !!!!!!!

My family & I keep coming back to this place. We drive over 10 miles to get our fix. I think it's safe to say that we are officially hooked, and when we are jonesin for Tacos Atoyac there better not be anyone or anything standing between us and our Food!

Today we all came aways lickin our chops and yummy in our Tummy. I might not brush my teeth tonight!

Here's what we had:

~ I had scrambled eggs with chorizo (dry), cheese, onions, potatoes, and Jalapenos. Served with side of refried black beans and spicy rice, and a little plate of grilled onions (sweet & tastey) and jalapenos.

~ The little woman had a Spicy burrito:al  pastor, cheese, onions, jalapenos, mayo, avocado, 

~ The kid had 5 mini carne asada tacos with cheese.
