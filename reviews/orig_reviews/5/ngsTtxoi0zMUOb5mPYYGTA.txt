The first thing I noticed when I walked into Nando's was the fresh aroma of ripe tomatoes and the sweet-sharp smell of cilantro. It really got the old appetite going!

Nando's has great Mexican food, with a more modern vibe than most similar Valley restaurants. The building is in the upscale Val Vista Lakes area, and although it isn't anything fancy, the dining room is nice and clean, and features some lovely iron work (done by one of the owner's father, BTW). 

Nandos also has a large slate-tiled patio, with built-in misters and heaters (depending on the weather).

They have huge portions, and there are lots of menu choices. Great chips and salsa -- a must for any great Mexican joint -- plus queso dip. I wish the salsa was hotter, but that's my own eccentricity I suppose.
