We were in Las Vegas last week, celebrating our anniversary. Since we were staying at the Wynn right across the street, we decided to enjoy a late-night dinner at Segundo Sol. (late for us is 9:00; we usually eat at 5!)  

We got a table in front of the patio.  A very friendly waitress came over promptly to take our drink order. I had a michelada in the big 32 oz. cup. K'ayum asked for a suicide (all soft drinks mixed together) and they were happy to oblige. Adriana had a prickly pear margarita. She said it was great.

For starters, we ordered the queso fundido and the grilled peppers. K'ayum ordered chicken taquitos. The queso fundido blew us away - it was amazing! It came with chips and hand-made tortillas. The grilled peppers were interesting - a plate of green peppers (and one red one) with lime and salt. They were quite tasty and not too spicy, until we got to the red one. There should be a warning label on it!  

K'ayum wasn't too happy with the taquitos because they had cheese inside, so we helped him - amazing!  And from the kid's menu! 

The waitress came by to check on us, and we decided we were too full to order anything else. I asked for the tequila list, and she recommended one of my favorite añejos - Reserva de la Familia - but I opted for Clase Azul (the reposado - I've only seen the añejo at one bar)  (Javier's at the Aria - $200 a shot...)

Although the food and service were both great, it was the michelada that did it for me. I came back the next morning at opening right before leaving for the airport to have one more at the bar, to see how it's made.  They put the usual: clamato, lime, pepper, worcestershire sauce - the big difference as far as I could see was cayenne pepper! So I've been making them that way at home ever since - and using my Segundo Sol cup (you get to keep the 32 oz. one...) to pretend that I'm still there!
