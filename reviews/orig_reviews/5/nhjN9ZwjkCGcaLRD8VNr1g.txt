My wife and I the other day went to Sol and it was the best! Food, drinks, and service were all on point and our server Amanda was excellent! Very knowledgeable and upbeat! We had to try the different variations of street tacos because, let's be real, if you're a Mexican restaurant and you can't make delicious street tacos then you may not be in business very long. Our entire meal to say the least was 5 star and we will definitely be back to try some of the other menu items they have to offer!
