I love Brushfire! I go there on the regular for breakfast burritos and tacos! It's the bomb! sometimes I roll there for a light 1 taco, rice and beans dinner and then get a Redbox to unwind. Sometimes when I show up to work w/ my brown bag breakfast from Brushfire, I be like "This some good gourmet s*#t right here!!...go get you Sum!"  - Fo real :D
