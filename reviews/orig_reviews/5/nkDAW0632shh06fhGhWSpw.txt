Alright! Everyone is a winner when Tacos El Gordo opens up a new location on the strip. Whether you're a tourist, drunk late at night, a poor college student, or just simply looking for a quick and affordable meal. Actually if you're staying at a casino on Tropicana and walking is your means of transportation then.. sorry, sucks to be you, but at least you have Earl of Sandwich at the Planet Hollywood. HOWEVERRR if you're a beast and can walk 4 blocks or so in triple digit heat then you indulge yourself by all means.

Why I love Tacos El Gordo:

1. Corn tortillas that are slightly fried before you get them
2. The asada is cooked when you order it (or at least in my experiences). That deserves a high five.
3. ALL-YOU-CAN-DRINK HORCHATA for $1.40? Don't mind if I do.
4. The spicy pork shawarma (adobada) looking thing, most definitely the star of the establishment. There is a slice of pineapple sitting on top of it, leaking all of its delicious juices into the delicious spicy pork. Plus you get a slice on pineapple added to the taco. 
5. Plenty of meat is given, along with the onions, peppers, and green sauce (I'm not sure if its guacamole or not). 
6. The bathroom is CLEAN! Be honest, you know how most cheap eats don't have the cleanest bathroom.

They also have beef head (Cabeza), beef tongue (lengua), and tripe I believe. No chicken just in case you're wondering. Lastly aside from the tacos they have asada or adobada fries ($10), tortas ($4), and quesadillas ($4). All the essentials to a drunk meal.

Random note: 3 tacos @ $2.00 each plus one drink comes out to be $7.99 after tax
