I feel back home every time I come to eat to Las Cazuelas. The flavors and smell of the food take me back to a Sunday morning at the mercado eating Mexican food with my family.
When my friends and family come to visit, they think I am crazy if I even suggest to eat Mexican food in the USA, but as soon as I took them to this place, they loved it!
The service and even the cooking lady are so nice and friendly.
I can't wait to have a day off and go back, next time I will try the Pierna torta that looks amazing in the pictures.
