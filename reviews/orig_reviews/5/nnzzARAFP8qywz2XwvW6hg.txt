I love Mexican food (and I love "Tex Mex" which is a term I can't stand but I use it because there is generally disagreement between some areas of the two and I want to be clear).  I love hole in the wall joints that are in fairly rough neighborhoods, fast food versions, and my favorite, upscale Mexican food.  My new favorite - La Hacienda.

I thought our first trip to La Hacienda could be a fluke, my other dining experience at the Princess was far from stellar so I waited for trip two to write my review.  Lucky for me my husband loved it too, we went back after two weeks.....

Lovely decor, romantic if you can reserve a table by the window in advance.  You have to walk a bit from the main entrance but they will call you a golf cart if you'd like.  If you are wearing skinny heels, take the cart.

The classic guacamole is delicious and we had an extra treat this weekend, they have some kind of guac fest going on so we tried the sampler trio - my husband loved the lobster guac, I liked the pomegranate but the pork belly guac was just ok.  You get six big chips with two of each type otherwise the regular guac portion is pretty good.

We tried the short ribs the first time, you're not going to get much better than this.  I tried the short rib enchilada the second time, just as delicious with outstanding black beans on the side.  Cilantro rice is the way to go if you like cilantro.  Queso was just ok without the chorizo but better with, even if you just push it out of the way to get the flavor.

Service is excellent.  Cocktails are unique with tons of top shelf tequila.  Sangria is delicious too.  No Mexican beer on tap but you can't have it all.

I thought it was rather reasonable, on par with other places in Scottsdale.  Visit three is in our near future, they have a flaming coffee with rum or tequila that is made with quite a flourish and I want to experience it first hand.
