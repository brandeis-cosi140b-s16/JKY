Great experience. Love Uncle Sals so thought we would give The Blind Pig a try. We ordered take out - If you have trouble navigating the website, google "blind pig menu" to find all the entrees. We ordered the al pastor tacos, short rib tacos, shrimp tamale, mushroom quesadilla, and ceviche. The standout items were the shrimp tamale and the short rib tacos. We will be back!
