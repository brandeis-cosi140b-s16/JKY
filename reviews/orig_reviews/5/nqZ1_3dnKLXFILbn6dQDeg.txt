Mmmmm, the tacos are so good. The pork belly taco will make you forget about the other white meat. My wife is in love with the calamari taco. After watching the movie Chef I had a need for a cuban sandwich and the Che Torta took care of that.

Servers are friendly and attentive. The owner was present both times we were there. On our first visit, a Saturday, he dropped by the table to make sure everything was great. We chatted about the music playing and the band that was to play later that night, which I believe was to be a jazzy reggae band. The second visit was a weeknight and he greeted and seated us.

The indoor/outdoor seating was nice this time of year.
