This place was great!!! The meat melts in your mouth and nothing beats fresh corn tortillas! Took my daughter here today with her friends for a bday luncheon and everyone loved it! The elote was ok I still think the ones I buy off the street in LA for $1 are better but hey I'm not gonna complain! The staff are so helpful and since it was I first time there they explained and helped us through! They were all so very friendly! I will mos def be back. 

P.s they have a dj there that is awesome! I almost thought I was at a club on the strip mind u it was 1:30pm.
