This place is like crack for foodies :)  You just cannot get enough!  This should be #1 on your list when out of towners visit you, they'll just drop their collective jaws.  Hit Tradiciones for lunch or dinner and then the market for those tortillas steamin' in the bag OMFG there's little finer in life!!  Their homemade chorizo is spot on, produce is good (and CHEAP!) .  I want one in Moon Valley!
