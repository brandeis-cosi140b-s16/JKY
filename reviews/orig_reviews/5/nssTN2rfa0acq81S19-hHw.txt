I don't know why anyone would ever pass up a taco from Las Palmas for Chipotle. This taco stand is quite the gem. I think everyone else has covered the tacos so I will talk about the grocery store itself. Inside, they offer pastries, snacks, drinks (I thought it was interesting that they included aloe vera from Asia), a small aisle for produce, spices, the biggest cans of beans you will ever see, all sorts of hot sauces, coffee, cheese, and meats. They even have body soap. 

A few noteworthy things: 
- their green mangos (don't be put off by the color - they are delicious)
- the slices flan and tres leches cake sitting in the fridge
- the ROASTED coconut juice (it's that much better than regular coconut juice, which I hate)
- they sell plantains! 

My biggest regret was neglecting the bucket of $1.50 tamales sitting unassumingly across from the checkout station. I was full from my two tacos so I didn't buy one, figuring they always sold them. I have been back twice and they have not been there. I am guessing that they make them on the weekends only and that they go fast. Learn from my mistakes.
