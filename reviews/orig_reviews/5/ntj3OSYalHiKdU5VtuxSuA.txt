We loved their food.  I ordered the Chilean Sea Bass and my partner ordered the Garden Enchilada.  My sea bass was fresh and cooked to perfection.  My partner loved his enchilada.  We also had the Crisp Calamari for appetizer which was cooked very well.  The service was exceptional.  They accommodated our dietary needs (we are pescatarians).  Because they knew it was for my birthday, they also gave us a dessert: the bread pudding.  It was great.  This has to be the best one I had ordered here in Vegas.  I highly recommend the restaurant.  It is definitely a nice place to have a quiet night and enjoy food.
