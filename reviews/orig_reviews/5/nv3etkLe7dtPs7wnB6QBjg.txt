A little bit hard to find (entrance is right next to Saphire's Strip Club), but more than worth the effort!  
Great food and service!  Maybe our new favorite Mexican.  Margaritas actually have alcohol in them....chicken enchiladas were delicious as was the lightly breaded chicken with a tomato, onion, and pepper salad on top.
Our waiter had recommendations and was there when we needed him......nice atmosphere.  
Great restaurant!
