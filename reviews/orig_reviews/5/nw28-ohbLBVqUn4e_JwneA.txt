Excelente dining option, first time in Phoenix!
My husband used to come to Macayos 15 yrs ago while visiting our son! When planing this trip, he was sure to add it in our plan and! Needless to say we had a great dinner excellent Margaritas and our server Greg was very nice and professional! Can't wait to come back!
