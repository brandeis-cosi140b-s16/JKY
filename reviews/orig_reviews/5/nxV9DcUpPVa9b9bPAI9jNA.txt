Taco Taco is the closest to authentic Mexican food as it gets. I've tried just about everything on the menu & not once have I been disappointed! Absolutely love the hand made tortillas and love how the chicken actually taste grilled & fresh. All of their meats do! & don't get me started on their sauces, so much variety & so much flavor! What's not to love about this place its a def must try for anyone & everyone. There is something for everyone, meat lovers & vegetarians. One of my all time faves I recommend all my friends is the carnitas mula, it's to die for!!!
