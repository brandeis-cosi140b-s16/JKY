We frequent this place, as it is down the street from our business, and it's always amazingly good. I placed a to-go order, it was waiting for me right on time. I had a co-worker call and order last minute while I was picking up. While I was waiting for the additional food, the manager (I assume) made sure I had a complimentary drink, along with chips and salsa. She also rushed my additional order, and I was out the door ASAP. Excellent service, and delicious food. Perfect!
