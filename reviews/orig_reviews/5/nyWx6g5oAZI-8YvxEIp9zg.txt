Went to Barrio Queen for dinner with my wife and son. We started off with chips and salsa. The chips looked to be homemade and the salsa was a smoked chipotle style (flavorful but not spicy) and was very good. My son ordered the California Enchilada with Pork, my wife ordered the Carne Asada Burrito and I ordered the Azteca Burrito. We also ordered a side of Chipotle Mashed Potatoes. All the food was very flavorful and very good. No complaints about the food at all. Our waitress was also very prompt and refilled our drinks often and the other servers also assisted when needed. The price of the dishes was a little high but the portions were large and filling. Overall I give the place 5 stars and will definitely be back.
