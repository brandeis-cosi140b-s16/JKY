Went here when some of my friends from NYC came to visit me on a recommendation. And we were all very pleased. The decor is beautiful. The food excellent. Try the corn it's delicious. I had the short ribs. They were perfect!  Dessert was great! A very good experience. A bit pricey but well worth it I promise.
