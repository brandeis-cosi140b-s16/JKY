Hands down! Best Carne Asada & Al Pastor you can find in Vegas.  

The Pastor(pork) is on a rotating spit with a chunck of Pinapple on top like it should be and it's the first thing you see when you walk in the door.  It has that sweet and smoky flavor any good Al Pastor should have.  I've been suckered into various taco joints in town that had a Pastor spit, hoping that I would find something as good as you can get in Mexico.  I've always come away very disappointed.  El Gordo's has it down.

The Carne Asada is marinated and grilled to perfection.  It has that distinct flavor of the Original El Gordo's in Tijuana.  Getting Asada this good is a rare occurence these days.  I've been all over Southern California and Vegas and I can only count 4 or 5 Taco stands that I've found in the last 15 years that even come close to this Asada.

When I first saw that the tacos were 2 bucks, I balked a little, but when I realized it was the same name as my favorite stand in Tijuana, I would have paid 4 bucks for a taco in hopes that it was half as good as I had remembered it.  The tacos are well worth the 2 bucks considering that they pack them full of meat and will top any taco off with as much guacamole, cilantro, and cebolla you want.

I've only been there three times since I found this place, so I haven't had a chance to try some of the other meats.  I'm sure everything is on point just based on the Asada & Pastor.  Next time I'll have to try the Lengua & Buche.
