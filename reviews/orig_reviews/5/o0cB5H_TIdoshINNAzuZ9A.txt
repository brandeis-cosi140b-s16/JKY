Wow. The best carne asada, skirt steak cooked medium. My Officemate talks about this place all the time, I never tried it even we go to Vegas a lot. Finally decided to give it a try after attending a trade show and wow. The chips are fresh and you have three options for dipping. I order the skirt steak and the corn that came with it on the side was amazing. It tasted so fresh, I can eat there over and over. 

The staff is amazing, it's good with kids so don't worry about that. It looks too intimidating but it's not. They have kids meal and they give kids paper and crayons to keep them busy.
