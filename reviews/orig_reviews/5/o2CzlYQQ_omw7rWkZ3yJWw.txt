TACOS TACOS TACOS.
FINALLY. The BEST Carne Asada, I have ever had. 
I tried the Bombero Burrito - $4.95ish with Green Chile pork inside. SPICY. AWESOME. The burrito is served Enchilada style, with a smoky chipotle sauce on top + cheese. an awesome burrito, and a great value!
The real gem at this little place though are the Carne Asada Street Tacos ($1.15 each!) . Perfectly marinated meat, not greasy, high quality, and served on the most delightful little corn tortillas.  I've eaten a lot of BAD Carne Asada in my life, and I'm thrilled to finally find a place that makes it so well!
My co-diners had Shrimp Tacos, and a combo plate that had a tamale, enchilada, rice and beans.. both of those were under $7.... they were good, but I'll say again, Carne Asada is the *star* at Los Taquitos. I even had a few more Tacos for dessert. :P  
Bright, joyful, warm staff... seats are tiny, and so is the dining room.. but I'd sit on the side of the freeway to eat food from here, if I had to. :) IT IS SO AMAZING.
