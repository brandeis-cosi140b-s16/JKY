My son and his fiance brought us and a friend here Saturday night for dinner. We had a reservation but arrived an hour early to sit at the bar for a drink. The hostess was pleasant (with beautiful light lilac colored hair) and said she could get us a table early, which she did within 20 minutes. 

Our server was prompt, knowledgeable and very helpful. I am a vegetarian so I read menus whenever possible before my first visit to a restaurant. I knew going into this place that there wasn't a selection for vegetarians, but I held out hope that the there were sides not listed on the menu that I could have them put together for me, which they did. 

We ordered appetizers - the roasted garlic plate was delicious! I didn't try the other appetizer plate that was primarily dead stuff, but everyone else said it was wonderful. For dinner I tasted one of their potato stuffed chilies and that was very tasty; I also had sauteed vegetables, rice and beans. I presume the rice was cooked on broth, but I didn't ask. The beans were really good, but very salty. Most restaurants salt the heck out of their beans, though, so I won't deduct for that. I turned my plate of food into 3 meals! 

Everyone else at the table loved their entrees. They said their meat/seafood was cooked perfectly with the right amount of sauce/seasoning. 

I must commend our server again, he was a young guy who couldn't have been more accommodating. I read reviews where service was the biggest issue for other customers. Fortunately, that was not our experience. 

We will definitely eat here again.
