Every time I go to Z'Tejas I just love it! I always pig out on the Trio App - warm queso, salsa, and guacamole - and taste my meal. I always take home left overs.  Tonight I got the Steak Fajitas. They were delicious and a bit different than other fajitas I've had. There was a citrus flare to these fajitas without too many onions and peppers. 

This was the best part: 

On Tuesday's Fajitas are only $10.99 and you get 1/2 your first margarita! What a deal. If you've had the margs at Z, you know you don't need much more than 1. 2 will do you. I highly recommend the Chambord Frozen Margarita. Delicious! 

The service was quite attentive. Presentation was nice and the patio was perfect. 

Quite honestly, not a thing I didn't like at Z'Tejas - Tempe. BTW, I usually frequent the Scottsdale Fashion Square location. They remodeled their entire restaurant. I love the new atmosphere although the patio is always my first choice for a table.
