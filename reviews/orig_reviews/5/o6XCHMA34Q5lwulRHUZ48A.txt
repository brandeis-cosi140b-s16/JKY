Mmmmm the food was so good! The chips, salsa and bean dip provided in the beginning were plentiful and replenished without even having to ask for it! That's a big plus because a lot of places almost seem reluctant to give you more chips and salsa. 

I had the two enchilada plate. The lettuce and tomato salad that came on it seemed fresher than other places, and the rice was good (no beans for me). I went with a party of 7 and everyone else's dishes looked very good and there were definitely no complaints from anyone!

It was my niece's birthday, and the servers all assembled and sang happy birthday with a big sundae for the birthday girl. Our server was named Caesar, and he did a great job. So the service was top-notch!

I'll definitely want to come back!
