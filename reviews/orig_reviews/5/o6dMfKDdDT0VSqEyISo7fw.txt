I have never been a fan of places like Chiptole/Moes etc.  I went to Phat Burrito a few years ago, and I don't get burritos anywhere else!  They always use great fresh veggies and you can get whatever you like, however you like- I'm pretty picky and only like certain things on my burrito, and they will make it that way- no problem!  Their veggie burrito is fantastic, and they now offer tofu- which i recently tried, and is also very good!  The fish burrito (which I didn't try for a while) was FANTASTIC!  It comes with a mango salsa that is just amazing with the fish flavors (you can get it on the side if you aren't sure)
Some of the other reviews are true, rice can be harder at time, sometimes it isn't the cleanest of places...but this isn't Flemming's Steak House- this is a great local establishment- the guys who work behind the counter remember your face when you have been there a few times...and it is 99% of the time a fantastic burrito (or quesadilla, or taco salad- I have tried them all!)
*just note at lunch the line is OUT THE DOOR- and the wait is longer than dinner times!
