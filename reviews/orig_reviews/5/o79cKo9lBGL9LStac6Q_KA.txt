Vegetable tacos are so delicious! I've only had them vegan, but you can get them with cheese. We get them with the hot sauce...goes well with the pickled cabbage in the taco. YUM! (Meat-eaters in our family say the hamburgers are very good....but I have no direct experience!) Fries are crispy and I like the salt AND pepper on them.

Now for dessert...the shakes are so good that I have stopped getting them. The salted caramel was so amazing that I was craving it and finding reasons to stop there more than once a week and get one. And my behind does not need any extra shakes!! Try one if you've got some extra calories left.
