This was my first time in and I was not disappointed!! I loved it so much that I am going to return tomorrow for lunch!! The chips and salsa are delicious and tacos are perfectly portioned! I can't wait to go back and try it all! The atmosphere is great too! Once you try this place you will be hooked!! :)
