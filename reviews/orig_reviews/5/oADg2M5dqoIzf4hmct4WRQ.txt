i have been wanting to try out border grill's brunch for a few weeks now. with my birthday on sunday Dan decided to take me here. woohoo!! how have i never tried out their brunch?? it was the best brunch I have had here in Las Vegas. Everyone was so delightful and even made me a birthday card. Our waitress was friendly and helpful with selecting what we wanted. for $25 it is an all you can eat made to order brunch. did you read that? MADE FRESH! ALL YOU CAN EAT! YUMS! we started with a guava empanada. it was good, but i knew i had to get my share of the yucatan egg benedict. I should have saved that for last though.very filling for such a small plate. the biscuit and sausage gravy was amazing too. steak and eggs were an A+ and Dan's favorite. the coconut french toast had me wide eyed with a giant smile. very heavenly. i wish i could have tried more. this is when i wish my stomach was larger. our waitress brought me out a mexican chocolate birthday cake which was awesome. something to order when it is not included in the all you can eat menu. for $5 more we added on the bottomless mimosas and i am so glad we did. they have a few flavors to choose from including the classic mimosa.
I was very pleased with this brunch and I am sure I will be back. The covered outside patio had me feeling like i was on vacation even though I am a local. The food was amazing and the staff beyond friendly when they didn't have to be. They made my birthday! They also offer a locals card with your Las Vegas ID for 15% off which is an added bonus.
This place was def money well spent. Can't wait for the next brunch!
