THIS IS FOR REAL!
I am born and raised from San Diego, and one perk is we are so close to TJ, Mexico for delicous tacos. We have Tacos el gordo all over San Diego and it is AUTHENTIC taco stand tacos. Everything is finger licking GOOD! You pay a little bit more but trust me it's so worth it!

ENJOY!
