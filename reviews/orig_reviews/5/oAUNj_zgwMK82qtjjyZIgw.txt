I was looking for a new place to eat near the US Airways stadium and not a sports grill or a real fancy place- just a place that has good eats and drinks. the patio was appealing but it was a little cool so we went inside. it's a small place but a huge atmosphere of welcoming waiters and terrific food. the service was quick and our waiter matt was awesome. he even brought out some insanely good dip for us to try with our sweet potatoe fries (that we didn't even ask for!)   - just a neat little place with great food... they have a great happy hour menu from 3-6pm
