Bomb! The chips/salsa and bean dip are 10 thumbs up! 



We ordered an Asada wet burrito plate (green AND red sauce please) green sauce is like a picante lime (huge fan) and the red sauce was more tomatoe based (still bomb) 

And all the tequila brands you could possibly want ! 

Order the flan!!! So spongey 

Our bartender Xavier is the perfect balance between attentive and leaves you alone. Love this place
