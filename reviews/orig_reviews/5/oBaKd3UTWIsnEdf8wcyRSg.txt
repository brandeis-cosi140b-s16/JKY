Hands down my favorite mexican restuarant in Madison.   I can't speak highly enough of the staff or food.   My favorite is the the chile relleno.   Their flan has a smooth consistency that is often missing from that desert.   On top of that the small items- tacoes, at are great a great deal.  They don't serve tex-mex so don't go in expecting taco bell.  :)
