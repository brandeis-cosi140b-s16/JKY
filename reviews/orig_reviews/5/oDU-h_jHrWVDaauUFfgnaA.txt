I have been waiting for this place to open a long time.  It did not disappoint!  Food is fresh and authentic. Service is great with Jesus Garcia as the server and Luis Valenzuela as busser. When I asked Cesar Cardona to recommend a dish, he was happy to go to the kitchen to get me taste of it. With so many great dishes on the menu, I can hardly wait to come back.
