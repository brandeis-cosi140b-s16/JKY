Where to begin?  Food is incredible.  Service is superb.   Atmosphere is welcoming and dark, but with a fireplace.  Open kitchen.  Smells wonderful.  Mike and AJ at the bar are great.  Laura and Dave at the grill and cooktop are masters.  We went twice in 3 days after moving close and we'll be back countless times!
