I come here with my brother for our bonding dinner time, and man oh man!  Never have I had my order wrong here, they just make everything so wonderfully, and when we get our food it is piping hot!  I love the fact that this is a small place located in the strip mall, and if you don't pay attention, you could miss it.  Its a wonderful place to grab a bite!
