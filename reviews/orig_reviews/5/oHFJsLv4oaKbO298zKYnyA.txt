So, I recently discovered this place and it suddenly became my favorite Mexican place in town. It has a weird name, so I always thought it was BBQ or something. I've been back a few times and bring friends. Amy, is usually our server, and is hilarious and takes good care of us. I liked that she knew my name after only coming there twice. Most places in Old Town, people couldn't give two shits...this was a nice change.  You can sit outside on the patio,which is relaxing. My favorite things are the $7 Patron margaritas. I always get two, because, well, I'm a lush. The bean dip is amazing, but my favorite's the short rib tacos with House Rice. I tried some of my friends' shrimp tamales and macaroni and they were amazing and rich. This is the one of the best kept secrets in the area. So go! Like tonight!
