Found out about this place via Yelp while out in Vegas with my whole family. So happy I did! From the moment we walked in to the time we left, everything was great!!! To start off, the waitress was super attentive and friendly. 
We all got the menudo... Yummy! My sister had some type of mango margarita with chamoy that was refreshing and delicious. My dad had a michelada and swore it was one of the best. 
It's a bit of a drive from the strip but it's worth it! 
We will definitely be going back when on Vegas!
