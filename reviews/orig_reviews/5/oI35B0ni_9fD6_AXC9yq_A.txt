You want to know why I am giving this place 5 stars after a bunch of local hacks give it 3 or less?  Let me tell you.

The food is quite good.  Let's all not over analyze the situation here.  It's Mexican food.  And better than many other local places.  You went here for lunch one time and the service was marginal so you give it three stars?  Did you taste your food?  Are you comparing this to Taco Bell?  Do horses wear socks? 

The bottom line is that Blue Adobe has great food, great beer, and you should eat here.  The wait staff is very good. As much as I come here for business TRUST.  You will not be disappointed.
