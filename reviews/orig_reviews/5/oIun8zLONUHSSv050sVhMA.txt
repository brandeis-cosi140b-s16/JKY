Went in for dinner tonight and sat on the patio! We ordered a bottle of Pinot Grigio and it was HALF OFF! Smokin deal! AND little did we know from the last time we went in they got a SKEEBALL machine!! Super fun night! Wine, skeeball, and LIVE music! Great combination for a great time! I was impressed with the service as well! It's rare to have such good of service as we had tonight! Thank you sandbar! I will be back!!
