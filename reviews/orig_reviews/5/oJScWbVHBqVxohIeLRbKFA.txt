As a Girls Night Out favorite spot, I decided that it was time to write a review.  We (us girls) LOVE, LOVE this place.  The food, especially the tacos are the best and don't get me started on their margaritas.  I have tried ALL of them and they are my new favorite place for margaritas.  I tend to be very picky with margaritas, Modern Margarita has several on their menu that really please me.  
I highly recommend this place as an ANYTIME place. We were there last weekend with my kids and they loved the fact the the chips and salsa were free. They offer a good selection for the kids as well, please note that we wouldn't have gone there if they weren't kid friendly.  

Again, my 3 boys would HIGHly recommend this restaurant!
