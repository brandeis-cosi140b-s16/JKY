We were staying at the Biltmore and decided to walk around the Biltmore Fashion Square.  Decided to have lunch at Blanco Tacos & Tequila. 

Food:  DELICIOUS!   Everything had amazing flavors.  You can tell they spend a lot time putting TLC I to all these dishes! I had the Chicken and Poblano Pizza. My husband had the street tacos.  All the flavors were awesome!!

SERVICE:  Excellent!! From hostess, server to manager.  Our server was great!  Very friendly and informative. The manager, Cricket, was absolutely exceptional!  She is super genuinely nice!! We even chatted for awhile.  

PRICE:  Reasonable 

AMBIANCE:  Very fun, Latina music, clean, friendly, casual.

I would highly recommend you to try it! I am a foodie and a cook so trust me when I say the food is great and service was exceptionally great!!

Will definitely return!! :)
