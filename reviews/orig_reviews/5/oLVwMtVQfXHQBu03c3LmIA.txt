Everything is Delicious!  Old favorite is adovado burro... New favorite is Victoria's chicken!  Taco salad with chicken is also delicious.  You have choice to add any meat to your taco salad.  If u r not into spicy foods...get a salad!  Green and red sauces are both hot.  House margaritas are big and lethal!  Can't taste the alcohol but sure do feel it! At happy hour they are $4 (half price).  3-6 week days I think.
