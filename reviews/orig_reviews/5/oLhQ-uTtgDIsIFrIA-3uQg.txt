Fantastic!! Super fast, but with quality fresh food!! Walk in, order, and eat!! 

 I love the salads, the fresh made in front of you tortillas, even my 12 year old loves it, and thats a tall order!

 Try the fresh horchata and mango papaya juice to go with your tasty meal!!

 You can also order easy take out or catering.. the ONLY thing I wish they had.. was delivery!
