El Hefe Tempe has it going on. Like my review of the Scottsdale location, this is a lunch time review.

My friend and I sat at the bar and ordered lunch from the menu. The bartender was HOT and really smart and funny. She even showed me how to make one of their signature drinks when I asked about it.

With regard to the food, it is probably better than Scottsdale, somehow. I had the mole enchiladas and they were incredible. I've had many different kinds of mole, including super authentic Queretaro style. This was very well crafted and better than any that I've had. 

My friend had a variety of street tacos and loved them.
