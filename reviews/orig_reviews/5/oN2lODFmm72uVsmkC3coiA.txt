Brunch brunch brunch NOMMMMMMMMMMM

Some friends and I hit this place up for brunch this past Sunday, and I was BLOWN AWAY but this hidden treasure. $25 for a tapas style brunch, $30 for all you can drink mimosas. I tried the shrimp BLT which was my favorite, the chilaquiles which was a close second, the crane asada tacos. The carne asada was tender and flavorful, an excellent choice. I di dorder the breakfast enchilada but it wasn't my favorite so I passed it a long. A teensy bit too spicy for my palate. I wrapped up my meal with the fruit plate, and it was divine.

Oh, and the best part? The bloody mary with BACON infused vodka. Do yourself a favor, order it. It will leave you craving another a week later when you're not even in Vegas anymore.

Our server Tom was as good as it gets and a breath of fresh air after some of the experiences I had in Vegas. Hes a delight, the food was amazing, and it was walking distance from my hotel room which made it well worth everything.
