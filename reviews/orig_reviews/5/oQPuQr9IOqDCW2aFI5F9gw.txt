I'm so surprised by the negative reviews but have to assume was first friday compounded with opening day that made it crazy. We went in on Saturday afternoon and it was just awesome. The service was beyond great. They were helpful with getting our game on and were super attentive. The cocktails were creative and delicious. The house salsa is phenomenal!!! We will be back for sure!
