Thank you, Guy!

Went to this place last Friday at lunch, and the line was out the door and the place was packed with people waiting for their to-go orders.  I got the 3-taco combo, and chose chicken, pork and steak.  The pork and steak were incredible and the chicken was great too.  Fantastic flavors.

This is not a place you can go and drink beers and margaritas or even get fresh guac, but they serve some DAMN good tacos with amazing flavors.
