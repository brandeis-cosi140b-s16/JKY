First off, apologies to Las Cazuelas for delaying this review.  This place is simply awesome, and I should have written this review sooner.  As someone who doesn't eat a lot of Central American food, LC has earned a place in my regular rotation when I am on this side of town!  

Don't let the modest atmosphere of the restaurant fool you, the food quality here is just about as gourmet as it gets.  I've heard to referred to as Pueblan food more so than Mexican.  I must admit that I am ignorant in this area, but I can tell you this is not your typical Mexican food.  

I highly recommend trying the enchiladas with the mole sauce.  This sauce is homemade with a delicious non-sweet chocolate flavor.  I crave it.  The verdes sauce is also excellent.  The new churros are the best I've ever had; custard filled with a homemade sweet chocolate sauce that will blow you mind!

This place is an absolute must try if you live in the area.  I guarantee you will not be disappointed!
