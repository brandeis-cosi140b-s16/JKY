The food is wonderfully fresh and totally delicious. Beware though: the chips are insanely good and the tequila flights are not only a treat, but a decent value.  And the decor is festive and classy without being over the top as can easily happen in Vegas.  Don't miss this gem.  And locals come on Monday nights for discounted food and drinks!
