I went to The Mission for lunch with my bosses and it was great! I've been wanting to go for some time now and I really want to check out their brunch on Sundays which I heard was amazing.

The ambiance is really laid back and mellow but in a cool, retro hip way. We sat at the bar for lunch and everything was great. I had the skirt steak tacos which were absolutely delicious - I was so full but I wanted more! We also got the basket of french fries...a combination of traditional fries and sweet potato fries. OMG. so good.

You should definitely go check it out if you haven't already - the food and drinks are great!
