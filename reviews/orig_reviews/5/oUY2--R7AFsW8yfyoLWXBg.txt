I love it that the restaurant smells like delicious smoked meats. I had the chilaquiles with carnitas and it was very tasty and a lot of food. The meat was very flavorful and a mixture of crispy and juicy. The salsas from the salsa bar are very good too. The atmosphere is very vivid and friends have said it looks like something right out of Rocky Point.
