The street tacos are the closest to a small town Baja street taco that I have found. The spices are fantastic, and there are new ones to try from time to time. I like hot, and I haven't tried the milder selections except in the little sample cups. Green chile is done well, and the flavors are slow cooked into the sauces and meats. Nothing is hurried in the preparation. As mentioned by others, sampling the meats is a great way to try them all. The only thing that would improve this spot is to play mask movies on the TV screens. It's hard to write about these guys without running over for my favorite tacos.
