This place is insane. So delicious and so worth the price! I try to cook as much as possible, eat at home as much as possible, but whilst on vacation in Las Vegas, I had heard about this place and knew I had to try it! 

First time here, obviously we were not locals (our bar tender didn't recognize us and made conversation) 

Our bartender was Ashley. She was super sweet. She knew that we hadn't been here before and explained everything! This is what you get, this is how much you'll get, this is good etc etc. 

For happy hour, you have to sit at the bar. No biggie. Bar stools and fast drinks. From 4-6pm and then 12-2am! 

Upon seating: Ashley brought us water. And chips and 3 salsas. A habanero. A green salsa and a red salsa. Habanero is really hot. Green salsa is perfectly spicy but not intolerable. Red salsa is more sweet than anything. first round of chips is free. 

What we ordered: 
Happy hour 2$ tacos: carne asada, carnitas. 
Happy hour drinks: two margaritas! 5$

****let me explain about this place****
They serve NON GMO FOOD. ORGANIC. TASTY. Free from antibiotics, pesticides and steroids. Whaaaaaaat???? We need more restaurants like this! You can click through on their website and see exactly where their produce, dairy and meat comes from. 

Impressed yet? You should be! Not too many restaurants do this! 

The tacos were so delicious, the cuts of meat were larger than I expected, but the meat was so tender it didn't even matter! The tacos have a layer of guac, then meat, then cilantro and onions. The guac: fresh and creamy!!!!! 

The margaritas were HUGE for 5$, but I'm also not a typical drinker so I don't know if that's just me haha! But it was strong and after 2, I had to keep it cool. 

**free flan if you check in** ashley told us about this! Glad she did! Flan was creamy and not breaking off in pieces like typical flan does. 
Chef Paco even came out to give us our flan. He chatted with us, thanked us for coming in, just an all around nice guy from what I can see!

We definitely recommend this place! Must try while in Vegas!
