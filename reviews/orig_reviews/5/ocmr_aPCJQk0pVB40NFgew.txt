Thank goodness for Yelp because I never would have tried this restaurant without reading the great reviews!  The food was absolutely incredible - good sized portions, very cheap, very flavorful.   We sat at the counter, so we were able to watch them make our meals, which I highly recommend.  I had the veggies tacos and the potato gordita, my husband had the mole burrito - everything was so good!  I can see how the atmosphere could scare some people away, but I think it added to the experience of eating there.
