This is my go-to for Mexican food. I can't find a better place closer so when we're on our way back from Vegas, or just need a fix, we drive up there! The chili verde, is so good I want to have some now, tender and yummy pork. I haven't had any of their margaritas, but the rest of the food is so good.  We normally get a few items to share, and the portions are so huge that even if you are hung over from a vegas trip, you'll find yourself feeling fine after eating here. When ever anyone is in town we actually drive up to Wickenburg just to eat there, it's that kind of good. The decor and seating isn't super, but with food as good as theirs I am not sure you need that much ambiance.
