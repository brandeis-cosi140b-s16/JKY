I'd heard good things, so my expectations were high. I popped by for lunch yesterday and tried the special - Steak Tostadas, I also tried their guacamole both of which were very well done. I really like the layout its modern, simple and clean with a fully functioning butcher shop to boot. They have a patio area with a fountain which will be nice post summer. Waitress/bartender was really sweet too.
