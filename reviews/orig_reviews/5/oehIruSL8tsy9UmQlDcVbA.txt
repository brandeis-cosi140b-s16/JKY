Met a friend here for happy hour after work on a Thursday.  We sat at the bar and ordered nearly everything off the happy hour menu: Pork sliders, pork tacos, Mexican street tacos and Nachos. Rum Punch for me and G&T for him.  Later added a Cornoa and another G&T. Even later, added a coffee w/Baileys and the apple something rather dessert. 

I'd go back five times a day every single day for the pork sliders - holy cow yum!  Food was fresh & colorful which is always a bonus on top of just being delicious. 

Service was super fun & friendly. Didn't venture out of the bar, but the atmosphere was great.  

Will hit Padre's again soon, for sure.
