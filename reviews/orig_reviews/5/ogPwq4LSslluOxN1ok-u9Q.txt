Finally made it in time for Happy Hour! Got 3 'appetizers' for the 2 of us and could NOT finish!! A lot of really good food at very reasonable prices. Good variety on Happy Hour too. Drinks were good pours and could get house or premium. 
ALSO, it was mentioned to us by Vinnie that they now do reverse Happy Hour 8-10 PM 7 nights a week!
