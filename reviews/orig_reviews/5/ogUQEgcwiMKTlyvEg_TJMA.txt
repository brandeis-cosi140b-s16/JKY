Added 9/7/11; We went again last friday and the glass is clean and the trash picked up! So definately 5 stars from me. Also, when the wife found out that I went with 4 stars she threatened to leave me, " You leave the toilet looking the way you do and you give them 4 stars for smudged windows and some weeds?" I stand corrected.

Okay, right off the top I want it to be known that as far as the food is concerned, 5 stars would not be enough. But...... I have to knock off a star for the look of the joint. You gotta invest in some glass cleaner! Also, you guys gotta get on the property management to clean that strip mall up a bit; pull some weeds, pick up some trash.

Back to the food........Incredible! 5 stars all the way. I had the bulgogi burrito w/ kimchi and an order of musubi. My wife had two fusion tacos, one beef one chicken. Burritos have been one of my favorite foods for a long time and this place has just added the exclamation point! Sweet, spicy, rich, moist with just the right amount of beans and rice. HEAVEN IN YOUR HAND!  

The musubi were large and the spam was perfectly grilled. Mmmmmm spam........ the other, other white meat.  

My wife got the tacos on the lettuce wrap thingies, which she enjoyed a ton. Next time I'll get a couple on regular tortillas. I can't wait.  Price wise, everything was cheap cheap cheap. That may be due to the location and the aforementioned property management deficiencies. I guess if a trade needs to be made for such cheap yet delicious food, I can put up with the streaky windows, the dead weeds in the planters and the "American Beauty" trash tornado swirling around outside the door.  

Thanks Komex, we'll be back again and again.  Oh yeah, services was great! As were the chips and salsa. Nice touch with the orange and fortune cookies at the end.
