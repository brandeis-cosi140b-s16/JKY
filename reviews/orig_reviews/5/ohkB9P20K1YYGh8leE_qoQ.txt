Wow!...we had a wonderful late lunch today. Food is fresh and flavorful. The best part was our server Enrique. Besides being super knowledgable about the menu he was....well AWESOME! He was friendly and passionate about his job. This guy is a pro. Will certainly tell friends about this place(and ask for Enrique) he will be perfect for your dining experience. Until next time-thank you
