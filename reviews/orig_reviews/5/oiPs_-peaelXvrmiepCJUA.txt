06/20/11 DINNER. 

Spouse and I both started with Cadillac margaritas, which were good and reasonably priced. We shared Nopalitos, a cactus salad served with flour tortillas, which was quite good, including the tortillas, handmade just feet away from our table. For entrees we each had a different shrimp dish. Spouse had the Camarones al Cognac, unusual to find french ingredients in a mexican place, this was very good and rich. But I think we both liked my shrimp dish more, the Camarones Sarandeados Tia Esther, which was shrimp in a butter sauce with unusual herbs and spices, and a touch of mayo (which was so incorporated you couldn't see it). Again, rich, but more flavor than the Cognac. The last time we dined here (Dec 2010, which was also our first time) the service was erratic, but this time it was excellent. Overall an excellent experience.
