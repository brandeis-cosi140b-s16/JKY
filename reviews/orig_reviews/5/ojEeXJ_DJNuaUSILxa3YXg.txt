If your from California and your looking for great carne asada look no further!!! Ive been to every taco shop around the avondale/phx area an man this spot is top notch! Honestly your greeted with a smile and treated like familywhat here! they have a huge selection of chimichangas, burritos ,tacos, shrimp cocktails,sopes and many more items, I got 3 carne asadas burritos and dammmm they remind me of my home town shop but they tasted better!! My dad was blown away that we could find better mexican food thenthis our home town in californian. They also had California burritosand which is kind of funny because in some places in California they don't even know what a California burrito is! I would recommend this place to anyone who wants good quality food! Clean tasting and very fresh meat! I was losing hope for Arizona until I found this place!!!
