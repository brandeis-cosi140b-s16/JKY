Have been going there for a couple of months now. Haven't had a bad taco yet. It's the way food should be . No need to add anything to it, just eat it straight from the kitchen. Love the shanghai tacos. the staff is great and very friendly. Have taken several friends and and all have love it. Can't wait to go back.
CAUTION!!!!! it's addicting.
