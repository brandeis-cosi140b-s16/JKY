Hands down best taco joint in Gilbert Heritage Square. Fish tacos.. On point. Shrimp tacos... On point. Lobster Tacos.. On point. Even their fish & chips & clam chowder is too die for. Honestly if I'm in the mood for seafood or tacos I alwaysssss go to SoCal. Their food lives up to the SoCal beach food crowd.
