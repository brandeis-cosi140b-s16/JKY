Chili rellano was delicious. I asked for one with breakfast and they did it for me. Breakfast was great! Our server Cassie was amazing, and I was a server so I mean GOOD! They asked to make the 5 year old with us a smoothie or ice creme! FREE. Chips and Salsa were good, atmosphere was fun, full bar, kid and family friendly. Clean clean restrooms and restaurant. Free samples of microbrew beer! Yum yum yum! Under $50 for 4 people for brunch, huh? Oh but I left a $20 tip! Grrrrreat.
