I'm so glad we discovered this place!!  It's not far from where we live which is a real bonus!  The whole family loved what they got...of course my kids feasted on authentic Mexican chicken fingers and fries (this is their staple no matter where we go).  They cleared their plates (which they NEVER do).  No food wasted!!  Love that!  My husband and I actually ordered Mexican food and boy was it good.  First the chips, salsa, and warm bean dip were wonderful and I had the best strawberry margarita that I have had in a long time (just the right amount of sweetness, but not overbearing).  I ordered the chili rellano dinner and my husband got the shredded chicken chimichanga (enchilada style--with cheese and red sauce over the top).  The chili rellano had a light/fluffy and delicious breading on it and the cheese inside was so good.  The green chili sauce they put on top was unexpected, but definitely delicious.  My husband LOVED his chimichanga!  PLEASE try this place...you won't regret it!
