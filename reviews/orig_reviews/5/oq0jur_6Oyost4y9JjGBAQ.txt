We loved this place! I can see why they have so many good reviews. I got the ground beef tacos. They were on corn tortillas and were the deep fried kind that are so good. Not like a Taco Bell taco. The cheese enchiladas were nicely sized and served with either green or red sauce. The chips come out with 4 different sauces/salsas. All very spicy. 
We will definately come back!
