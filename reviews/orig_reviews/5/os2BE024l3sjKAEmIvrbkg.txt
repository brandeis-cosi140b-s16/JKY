Pricey but worth it. 

We sat on the patio which was beautiful since it was just before sundown.
For our appetizer we had their guacamole that was made in a traditional stone pot. My guy pal said it was the best hes had in Las Vegas and he grew up with homemade guac.  They can make it mild, medium or spicy also, which is something I've never came by.

For dinner, I had the jumbo shrimp fajitas, which came with a side of sour cream, salsa, pico de gallo, and black beans & rice. In the skillet they had char-grilled corn, asparagus, white onions, cherry tomatoes & red peppers.


Dessert was recommended by our server: Coconut flan! It was smooth & creamy in texture and the coconut flavor made it all the more perfect.
I do have to say, do not get the sangria, I thought it was the worst I've ever had, but the flan made up for it so there.

Our server was Marisole who I recommend to request if you ever stop in; she's a sweetheart.
