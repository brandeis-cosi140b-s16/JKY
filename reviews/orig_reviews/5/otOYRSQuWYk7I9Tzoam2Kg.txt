I'm ready to move to Phoenix to be closer to my new love, Dick's Hideaway.

Thanks Phoenix yelpers for directing me to the mother of all whole-in-the-walls.

I ordered the first thing I saw on the menu, Pasta Heidi, which is green chile linguine with grilled chicken in a chipotle cream sauce.  It was so good, I'd like to move to Phoenix and get a job at Dick's, just for the employee meal.  I'll have to settle for a few more meals there before we leave town, because my husband thinks I'm being ridiculous.  I blame Dick's.

Can't wait to try their breakfast AND lunch.

See you tomorrow Dick's Hideaway.

Love Mary-Anne
