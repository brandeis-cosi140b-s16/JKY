Absolutely loved this place. Had the chips and salsa (pico de Gallo), cheese quesadilla, 2 Bombay tacos and 2 Shanghai tacos, and mint tea. Everything was super fresh, well seasoned and cooked perfectly. I didn't have any taco soggyness issues that a few reviewers mentioned. Great price too! Service was prompt, helpful and friendly :)
