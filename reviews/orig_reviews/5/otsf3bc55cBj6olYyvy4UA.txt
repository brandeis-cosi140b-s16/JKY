This is now my new favorite place in Tempe! It is quick, cheap and delicious! My husband and I were looking for some quick Mexican food and decided to give it a try. We were promptly greeted and asked if we had been there before. Once we said now we were handed tons of samples and thoroughly explained the menu to us. Man, it was hard to choose because they have so many meet options and they all tasted so good. I went with the green chili pork and my husband went with steak. Both were ridiculous! I love how they have healthy options too like wheat tortillas and black beans. The jalape√±o cream cheese was also very good. I'd love to smother that all over a bagel in the morning. Try this place people! You won't regret it!!!
