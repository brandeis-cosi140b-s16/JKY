Fabulous!!! This is my third time here and I will continue to come back. The food is so amazing. I haven't had a bad dish yet. I have always come in a group of 4 or more and we order lots of dishes to share with the table. That is the best way to dine here because the food comes out when it is ready,not timed to all come out together. If you are each ordering your own dish and hope to eat at the same time you may be diasappointed. 

I have had many differnet dishes and my favorites have been the Crispy Chicken Mole, Rock Shrimp Tempura, Shaking Beef and Filet.  There are so many dishes to chose from. The fusion flavors are so unique, like the Asian inspired seasoning on the Shaking Beef with a Cilantro Lime dipping sauce.The service is very good also, since we order many dishes, they area alwasy clearing platres and bringing new ones.

This is a very popular place with music/DJ some evenings si it is noisy. If you come early you may not have to wait for a table but if you come afte 8:00 you will most definielty have to wait. And that is on a weeknight. .
