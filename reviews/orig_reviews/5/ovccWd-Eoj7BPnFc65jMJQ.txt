Our absolute favorite place to go. 

Great food, that's always fresh and tasting great. 

We do pick up orders about once a week. Never have they messed up an order, and it's always ready for pick up in exactly 10 minutes. 

Decently priced. You get a good amount of food for price. 

We have dined in a handful of times and the service is great and fast. 

Give it a try if you're doubting!
