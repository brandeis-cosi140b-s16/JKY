Great place for happy hour! The tacos are amazing. Developed flavors and cool garnishes...the edible flowers were a fun touch. The ambience is very relaxed, but upscale. The service was pretty good; I usually like a little more interaction with the bartender though...however they were very busy. Will most definitely be back here, with friends in tow.
