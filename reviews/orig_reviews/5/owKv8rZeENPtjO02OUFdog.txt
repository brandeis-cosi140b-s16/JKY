Chef Paco is phenomenal! I've never had an executive or head chef make a personal connection with his guests like Chef Paco. The food is amazing...the flavors are perfect and the presentation is beautiful. We have declared El Dorado our weekly Monday night spot, as it's 50% off of everything for locals...and when I say everything, that includes alcohol (they sure know how to treat us good)!! Omar, the bartender, is hilarious and sweet - he makes the best strawberry mojitos! The atmosphere is fun, vibrant, and exciting. Last Monday they had live music and it was at the PERFECT level of noise. Not too loud (where you're screaming to the person next to you) and not too soft (where you don't even realize music is playing)! I love everything about this hidden gem of a restaurant and always look forward to Monday nights!
