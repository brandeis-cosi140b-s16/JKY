The food is very good. The staff are professional and food is prepared quickly and fresh. I personally enjoy the fish tacos and rib eye tacos, the hand made tortillas really take it to another level. I also like the tostadas with pastor or chorizo, they come with great toppings. And the rice is amazing! Great place for lunch or dinner.
