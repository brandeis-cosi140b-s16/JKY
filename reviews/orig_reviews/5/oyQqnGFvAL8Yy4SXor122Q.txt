we saw this place driving the ice rink.
i was like "what is ko mex"
it was in chinese looking writing.
thanks to yelp, i had encountered a little gem!
indeed it was.
we had the bulgogi nachos.  very inventive!
i also had the spicy pork rice tostada.  interesting!  tasted like mom's food with some mexican thrown in.
the prices are cheap cheap cheap!
a good place to eat emotionally and celebrate!
