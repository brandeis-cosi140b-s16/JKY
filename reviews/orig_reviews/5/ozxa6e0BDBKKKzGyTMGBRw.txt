I love this place me and my sis go here everyweek for girls night out !!!! We love the food and the service everyone there knows us and is so helpful and friendly the fajitas and sopapias are the best in town. It's great for large parties or dinner for two . They have weekly specials almost everynight of the week and yummy drinks too. Must go if you havent been yet!!!
