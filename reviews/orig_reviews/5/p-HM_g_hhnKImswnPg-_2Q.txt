Garcias - la la la la la la la!

my sister sang this as we pulled in to the parking lot. Apparently it was from an old TV jingle from the early 90's. No, I don't remember the jingle nor do I know if it was for this particular Garcias.

I love the red salsa that is made here and what I really love is that they refill it with a pitcher! Yes more please! This is not to say that the food is bland but rather that I like a little bit of chip with my salsa to give some perspeive.

Amazing Guac, I found an entire quarter of an avacado in mine. Rellenos are to die for, none of the thickly battered over fried ones of the bay area. Nice light egg coating and a little bit of cheese. I love their red sauce on enchiladas too.

So yes, I ate a bite from everyone's plate here and was seriously satisfied. The only bummer is that I was on my way to the airport so I didn't get to keep my leftovers. But, my mom is going to have tasty dinner tonight!
