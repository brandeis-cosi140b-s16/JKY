My wife and I were pleasantly surprised at Ricardo's a few days ago for its half-off "Happy Hour" and discounted "Early Dinners".
- We had Large Margaritas on the rocks with salt (~$6.50@ happy hour);Quesadillas and Pollo de Ricardo's off their "Early Dinner Menu". Our Margaritas were wonderful in taste and GIGANTIC in size; dinner dishes were absolutely delicious and sufficient in quantity. We also loved its warm and crispy tortilla chips, as well as the two different salsas and bean paste! The HOT version of salsa could have been a touch spicier, though.

- The hostess and waiting staff (waitress and the one who brought out chips and water) were friendly and efficient. Our waitress was also quite helpful in offering her recommendations and explanations of house specialties.

- The restaurant is huge and its Mexican decor tasteful and inviting. Some quarters can be very nice for private groups. Yes, it has a nice, intimate bar area, but one can have HH anywhere in the dining room, too, besides its bar. We will definitely go back to Ricardo's again!
