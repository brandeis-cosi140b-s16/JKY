Absolutely awesome New Mexican food. If you like spice, they have it. If you want something beyond the traditional enchilada or burrito, they got it. This place has one of the most unique and romantic patios in the valley, with a waterfall and faux cave. If you are looking for an affordable date place or just a unique dinner out, this is it.
