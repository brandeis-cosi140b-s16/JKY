Been a here a few times--most recently with the girlfriend. I've had their steak in ranchero sauce (which was wonderful) and this time decided to get the steak cooked in green chile sauce served with rice, beans, and a cheese enchilada. My girlfriend ordered the chicken enchilada served with rice and beans. I absolutely love this place. I'm not sure what the soup is that they serve at dinner time but it's decent. I like the fact that you get chips and salsa AND hot bean dip as well if you are so inclined. The mariachi music can be a bit loud but they are pretty talented musicians I must say. I ordered a lemonade to drink and thought it was quite well made. The steak, as usual, was cooked perfectly to order (medium rare at my request) and I could taste the unique mexican seasonings in every bite. The freshly made guacamole is savory and went surprisingly well with my steak. The beans were garnished with cheese and were savory with the rice. The enchilada was juicy and just downright fantastic. My girlfriend enjoyed her meal as well. I am originally from southern California and I have yet to experience a Mexican restaurant as good as this one. 5 easy stars.
