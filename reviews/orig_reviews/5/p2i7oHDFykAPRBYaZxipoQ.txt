Not the best part of town but I was told that its cheaper to drive here than to fly to Mexico.

That spoke volumes to me.

It looks so legit inside and out.   It tastes even more legit.  Only advice is come hungry.  I didn't order the burrito but I seen it and it was as big as your head.  Maybe even bigger and it was around $10.00.

Our server told us that this family restaurant has a bunch of restaurants now Lindo, Vive, and some other type of Michoacan too.  This is the original.  

Fun dancing and singing going on.  Not only just the Mariachi group.  

Cant wait to revisit and sit on the noisy bar side of the restaurant.
