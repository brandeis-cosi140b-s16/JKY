This is my first visit here and I'm happy to say that the food is delish!  The chicken kabob is made just right...juicy & tender. Chicken Kiev is a Russian delicacy that not many restaurants serve, however,  it is made and served here!  The  portions are very generous and the service is friendly and fast.  Will be back for the entertainment.
