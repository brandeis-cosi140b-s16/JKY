Glad to see them back after closing down for awhile! Great Mexican food with amazing flavor and fresh ingredients! Service is always excellent! Staff is very courteous and makes sure your needs are taken care of! Food comes out hot and in good time! The restaurant is clean and looks great! A great addition to the summerlin/lakes area! Love the salsa too! Prices are on the high side but your paying for good food so I can't really complain! All in all a great place for real Mexican food!
