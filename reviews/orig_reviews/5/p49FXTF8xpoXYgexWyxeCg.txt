WOW!  This place is fantastic.  Its not at all what I expected-it far exceeded my expectations!  Tucked away in a strip center the restaurant is modern, clean and the staff exceptionally nice and helpful.  We went for breakfast on a Sunday but I think they were serving the entire menu as well.  The food may be Street food of Mexico but it is some of the best mexican food I have ever had.  The plating is exceptional and the food looks as good as it tastes.  The menu has items for everyone - meat eaters, vegetarians, vegans.  I cant wait to go back.
