Fantasic food at very good prices. OMAR is the bomb bartender , but the rest of the bar crew is awesome. We enjoyed cilantro rice with tender whole beans served in a massive bowl of pork & spices, Authentic chili colorado just like in Chatsworth @ Los Toros. Large value menu is good 24/7 all under 5.95. Be coming back to this place, Lets just make it a Raider bar for NFL.

MUCHO GRACIAS..Rick y Wanda
