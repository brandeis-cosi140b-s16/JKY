Great food for lunch. Pig wings meaty and decent sized. Jalape√±o ranch dressing reminded me of Texas. The pickled vegetables included as part of pig wings should be added to the menu as a side salad. Day at the bar and I'll definitely be back for dinner. Decent wine selection including a bottle of wild hog that I've had before and never seen at a smaller restaurant.
