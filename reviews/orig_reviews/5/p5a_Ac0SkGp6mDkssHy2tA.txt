Went to @ClarendonHotel for the Halloween bash. Stopped in to @GalloBlanco for dinner.

My girlfriend's first time in.

We ordered one each of the cochinita (pork), carne asada beef, and pescado (fish) tacos.

The pork was PHENOMENAL! Great flavor and seasoning, delicious.

The beef was equally good, but my girl dominated that one. :D

The fish taco, with ahi and red cabbage, and guacamole, was unbelievably good.
See, I'm not a fan of seafood in my tacos. Or even in any of my mexican food.

But I would order a dozen of these, and want more!

The crunch of the cabbage was a great contrast to the ahi, and the guacamole made for a perfect finish.

Thanks for another great meal! You have a new fan, as well. :)
