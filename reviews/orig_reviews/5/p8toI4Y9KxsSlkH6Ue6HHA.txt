My husband and I LOVE this place.  It's almost embarrassing how much we eat here.  I'm surprised we don't smell like their black beans, pork fried rice and jade chicken by now (our personal favorite three items to order together.)  Maybe we do, and people just aren't telling us?  

Anyways - this place gets 5 stars from me because of it's uniqueness and deliciousness.  Seriously I can't talk how much I love their black bean, pork fried rice and jade chicken combo.  It's the perfect combination -  a little salty, a little spicy, a little sweet.   

For dessert - we LOVE the volcano cookies - which taste more like a brownie cookie.  They only have them on Sunday's but they are a MUST.  The snickerdoodles are good too, but I'm not a snickerdoodle fan, due to an awful experience with the cookie  in 8th grade home ec. haha but that's a different post for a different time. 

If you're looking for a unique dive in Arizona (and believe me, there aren't many here),  then you have to at least give this place a try.  

Oh - plus they give SAMPLES!  It's like Costco, without the lines of kids.  We take all of our out of town guests here and the Californians always end up loving this place and posting pictures of the totally non-PC logo on their facebook.
