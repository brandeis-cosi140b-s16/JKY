Tacos are wonderful! One of my favorite taco shops on the planet! I love the carne asada and the small tostaditas. The meat has great cooked-over-wood taste and the guacamole on top is fantastic. Go early and beat the after drinking crowd. 

As a tip - remember to tip! Tips usually men fresh grilled veggies will hit your plate and some other extras. There are multiple meats to try here from basics to brains (sesos). The fries are a culinary treat! Enjoy this authentic taco shop!
