ate here for lunch today on the fly...the chicken poblano enchiladas are to die for.  a little spendy, but it is in the forum shops.  the iced tea was freshly brewed, the trio of salsas provided with chips were fresh and lovely, especially the green salsa.  i ran into a few people there that all gushed about how its their favorite.  apparently next time i need to try the potato tacos and get a sangria.
