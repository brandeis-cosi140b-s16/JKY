Had a great dinner at Panchos tonight. The wait was long, expected that because it's brand new, but time went by quick while I had a drink in the bar and watched MNF(Monday night football)... Awesome bar area with good HD TV's.. The scenery in this place is great. Definitely the best Mexican food I've had since I moved here a year ago.
