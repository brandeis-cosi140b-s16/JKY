I am not a huge fan of Mexican food but my friend wanted to check it out so I said why not, the reviews were very good and its right down the street. I was impressed that the place is always busy and packed but the quality of food and service is excellent. It is probably the best Mexican restaurant I have every been to and I have been to so many I cannot count since I living in Arizona and Las Vegas. Go there and you will not be disappointed, if I was more into Mexican cuisine I would give it 5 stars, well to be fair it deserves it so 5 stars it is.
