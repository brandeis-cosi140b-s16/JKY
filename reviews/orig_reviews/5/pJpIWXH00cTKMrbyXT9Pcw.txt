When I crave Mexican food, the flavors of their perfectly cooked meat and the freshness of their homemade tortillas is EXACTLY what I'm looking for.  They don't get skimpy with their meat, they don't waste time with beans or rice, they'll let you sample any of the meats before you order them, and they gladly explain what everything is for the unfortunate people like myself who don't speak Spanish.  I eat here at least once a month, and I eat the same thing every time, pork sopes with everything on it.  DELICIOUS!
