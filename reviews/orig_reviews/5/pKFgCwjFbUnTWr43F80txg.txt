We had lunch here and the food and outdoor seating was very nice.  Chile relleno and quinao fritters were very good.  Green corn tamales tasted good but were too wet and just fell apart into mush.  Prices were reasonable for vegas.  Food was better than the other upscale mexican restaurant we ate at (Hecho en Vegas).
