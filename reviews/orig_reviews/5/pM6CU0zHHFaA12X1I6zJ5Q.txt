It was Sunday evening during Christmas season.  We were at SouthPark Mall and decided to try to grab dinner at Cheesecake Factory.  Naturally, there was about a 30-45 minute wait.  We walked over to Chuy's who -- TA DA! -- saved the day.  Fortunately for us (but unfortunately for them, I'm sure), they weren't super busy, so we were immediately seated.  

Our server was fantastic.  Although she did have other tables besides ours, she noticed when our water glasses were halfway and immediately refilled them.  She also refilled our salsa (and chips) when she spotted it low.  That's the sign of a great server: she notices things, and that makes all the difference.  I like not having to ask. :) 

The chips always taste "light" at Chuy's (in a good way) and the salsa is fantastic and tastes so fresh (not like that dark red stuff you buy in a jar at the supermarket).  

For dinner, I tried their Sunday Night Special, which was a Macho Burrito.  I've eaten at Chuy's several times, both in Charlotte and Orlando, but this was the first time I've tried this particular entree.  It was amazing.  And probably the best and most flavorful entree I've had at Chuy's.  The menu describes the Macho Burrito as "a flour tortilla stuffed with roasted pork, green chiles, jack cheese & guacamole, smothered with Hatch Green Chile Tomatillo Sauce."  I think it was the perfectly seasoned pork that really made it fantastic.  It's part of their Green Chile Fest, though, and will probably make way for something else seasonal, and I'll be really disappointed not being able to order it again until next fall.  

We had a fantastic experience from being seated right away, to fantastic service, excellent food, and cheaper entrees than Cheesecake Factory.  Thanks for saving the day (and not hurting our wallets), Chuy's!
