Delicious. I'd write about what I've eaten at America's Taco Shop, but it would take much less time to list what I haven't eaten!

Some of my favs - Both the carne asada and al pastor tortas are mouthwatering. And their bean & cheese burritos are as good as it gets. Try the one with diced fresh jalapenos added for an additional $0.25. I also crave their guacamole. Definitely try their conchata - iced coffee and horchata mixed together. 

The only downside - don't come here with friends if you're looking to have a conversation. You'll all be shoving food in your mouths too fast to be able to talk.
