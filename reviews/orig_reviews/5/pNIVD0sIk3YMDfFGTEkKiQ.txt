Oh me oh my that was some delicious Mexican food. By far the best I have had in Las Vegas and the best I have had outside of Austin. 

Only negative was my whisky and soda, however I should have known better and just got it on the rocks. 

This is a restaurant and a bad drink should not dampen this amazing food, and besides the margarita I got next was spot on! 

Fresh made tortillas!!!
