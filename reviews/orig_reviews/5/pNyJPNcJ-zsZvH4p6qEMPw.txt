Everything was awesome and more!!! The food was amazing. Chef Paco came to greet us while finishing our dinner. My husband and I were celebrating our 1st year wedding anniversary in Vegas and wanted to go to a nice place for dinner and saw it had great reviews so we decided to go there. The flan is AMAZING. We had the peque√±o feast and it was to die for. The taste was AUTHENTIC!!! The margaritas are also delish. Not to mention our server Rorak was very knowledgable, friendly, and courteous. When we come back to Vegas in the future this will def be our go to spot. They are opening another one in LA... Cant wait!
