WOW, price, service, taste, atmosphere - Spectacular!

We got the rib-eye tacos (4 per order $7.49), los burritos (2 burritos, 1 beef and 1 pork) the presentation was awesome. Just like the pics you see on yelp. The place was bright and airy,  you can see the chef cooking in the open kitchen, which I especially like.  The food was seasoned and cooked to perfection (they even asked how I wanted the rib-eye cooked for the tacos and nailed a perfect medium) The salsa was super flavorful and there were all the carrots, onions, cucumbers, and jalapenos you wanted at the self service condiment bar.

I'll be back -- SOON!
