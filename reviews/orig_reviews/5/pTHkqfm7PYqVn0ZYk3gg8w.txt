HOLY JESUS!! Preeeeeeeeetty damn close to tacos from the taco stands in Mexico. The Al Pastor is the best, hands down! Not a huge fan of pork but this pork is on another level. ;-) Loved the Lengua (tongue) but was not fan of the Adobada tacos. 
These Taco Shops are usually always busy but this location in particular is ALWAYS packed because it's on the strip, especially after midnight. 

The quesadillas are to backflip for! they crisp the tortilla, melt the cheese and add meat-SO DELISH!...try everything you can possibly fit in your tummy!
