Great cheap food. Bring a Tums with you, just in case. I don't know how they can have such amazing low prices and still have a great tasting taco?! Makes me wonder... but more power to them.

This is a great place to hit on your way to Scottsdale if you don't want to pay 9 or 13 bucks for a burger. The place is made for the budget minded college student. I wish I had a place lik this near my school! I also wish they were open later, but from what I heard they get a lot of rift raft so they close early to prevent such events. 

The front is very nice, I order about $35 worth of food (which is a lot of food w. their prices) and was patient with my mangling threw the order.

I will come back to this place again, as long they keep making the food does make me sick. SO far they have keep me going!
