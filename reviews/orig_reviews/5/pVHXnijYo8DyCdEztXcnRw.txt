Absolutely fantastic. Wonderful, friendly and courteous service. Great food, great prices and a fantastic little salsa bar. Seriously, all of the sauces and sauces are to die for. Highly recommended for any lunch or takeout dinner.

Me and the wife had a selection of a lot of what they offer and everything's been fantastic. Crispy juicy fish and amazing shrimp.

*Edit: also the place is spotless ^_^
