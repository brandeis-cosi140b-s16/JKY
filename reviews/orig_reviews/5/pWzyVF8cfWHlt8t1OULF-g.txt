The staff was professional and attentive. Endless tortilla chips and three varieties of salsa came continuously until our food arrived. My burrito carne asada was very tasty. The salsa verde is the best I have ever had, and luckily was not in short supply. Paco, the executive chef, came and shared the story behind the food, and it was fascinating. He is passionate, talented, and driven to innovate! I will definitely be back many times.
