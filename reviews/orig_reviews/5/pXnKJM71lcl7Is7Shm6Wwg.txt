I don't typically write reviews, but stopped in here for lunch today with my boyfriend and had to share our great experience.  The place has an awesome, hip vibe including a blast of air conditioning which is a necessity in this heat.  The waitress let us know that the dishes are served tapas style so we ordered the Shishito Roll, Chicken Tacos, Korean Beef Tacos, and the Kimchi Rice.  Everything was prepared to perfection.  We especially enjoyed the quality of the meats and fish served as well as the orange Citrus Habanero Sauce on the table (we mixed it with our soy sauce for our sushi roll and used it to top off our tacos!)  

We can't wait to be back to check out the happy hour and dinner scene, and to add a couple of cocktails to the order.  One of my new favorite spots for sure!
