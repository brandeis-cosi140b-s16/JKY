This is not your mom and pop Mexican place so unlike some other reviewers, don't expect to be full for 5 bucks. 

That being said, Mercadito seems to be new school Mexican with creative dishes and fun flavors that you won't find in traditional places. From the small plates we ordered the Camaroncitos al Chipotle and the Queso Fundido with the short ribs add on. They were served at the same time and our server Lanie recommended us to mix and match the sides and sauces from both dishes and have fun with it. What a genius! 

Other friends enjoyed the langosta (lobster) tacos special but I thought the special steak tacos with some sort of jalape√±o dressing really stood out. 

The Pollo a la Brasas is the dish for you if you enjoy amplified flavors of garlic and lime. This is the one dish that I tried in their New York location many moons ago and still dreamed about until I finally tasted it again at Red Rock. Also, PLANTAIN RICE. YES.

OMFG this dessert... the baked bread pudding or something. Even being gluten conscious I couldn't stop eating.
 
Definitely recommend family style. We ordered a lot less than we thought we need to because the portions are actually not that small.
