In Phoenix for work, checked this place out and came back, several times. The tacos are fresh and so tasty. Nice to be able to have Jarritos soda. I tried the asada, pollo and carnitas; everything was great! Lots of food, i never left hungry. Fast service. Only downsides are they are cash only (not a big deal but know before you go) and parking is tough. There is additional parking in the alley out back, but it is the alley out back. I definitely would recommend this place to any fan of street tacos.
