Delicious! Love the fresh flour tortillas!! Definitely not store bought! The Cadillac margarita is excellent addition to the have with the chicken fajitas! The bean dip here is very good big enough for 4 people to share. Love the salsa because I like spicy and it has kick to it! The bizarre thing is you can get right in on the weekend because it's more of a lunch spot being downtown. I would recommend it! Nice quiet atmosphere for a weekend night.
