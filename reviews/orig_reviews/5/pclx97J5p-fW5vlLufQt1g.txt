Stumbled onto this place via other Yelp reviews while in the area and decided to give it a shot.  We've been back 2x now and this little place is now a permanent on our 'must eat at' places.  This is not a 'typical' Mexican food restaurant; there are some unique - and very tasty - twists to the standard fare on the menu.  Burritos are amazing!
