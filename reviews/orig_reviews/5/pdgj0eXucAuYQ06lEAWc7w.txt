By far the best Mexican restaurant I've been to.  And I'm from San Diego so I've been to a lot.  Wish we had a Casa Don Juan down there!  The beans they serve with chips and salsa are a culinary work of art as well as the salsa.  I've eaten there several times and it's always been great.  Pork and chicken tamales were awesome as well as the enchiladas.  LOVE this place and always make it a must stop at whenever I am in Vegas.
