This place has an authentic mexican vibe to it. Great ambiance and the best service I've had in any restaurant in a while. The waiter and bussers are super attentive and friendly. You can tell they all care about making your experience memorable. Great food, drinks, and live music on the weekends. Great place to have a birthday dinner!
