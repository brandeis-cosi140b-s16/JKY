I met my lil brother and family For lunch here, great service, very nice and great food, we ordered 2 sampler platters being that we had a coupon for a buy one get one free but we hadn't printed it out, the server had gotten a manager Pattie she was understanding that we were unable to print our coupon and asked us to email it to her and she printed it out allowing us to use it, I can appreciate good customer service and they offer that here, thanks for lunch we will be back soon,Thanks Zachary
