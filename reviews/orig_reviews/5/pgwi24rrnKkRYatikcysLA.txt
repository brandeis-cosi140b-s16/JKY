Have been here several times and it has never disappointed. First off, the service is amazing. Every employee here has been extremely nice, professional and knowledgeable about the menu. Second, food has always been great no matter what I get and you get three dips along with the obligatory chips before the meal. Third, they have great happy hour specials. You can't go wrong here!
