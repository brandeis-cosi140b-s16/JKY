Some of the best Mexican food in Phoenix  I have eaten here twice, both times the service was excellent.  Last night I had the chicken green chile enchiladas which were filled with tender and tasty chicken. The beans are the best I have had anywhere. And the rice was as close to being perfect as you can get.
