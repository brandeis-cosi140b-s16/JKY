The food here is absolutely amazing and so is the staff! The breakfast burrito is one of my favorite things but there tacos and regular burritos are also amazing. I have never been disappointed with the food here. Even the fish tacos are amazing. The only thing that is missing is the Mexican rice and re fried beans. They have rice and beans but i like a more creamy re-fried bean almost like a dip.
