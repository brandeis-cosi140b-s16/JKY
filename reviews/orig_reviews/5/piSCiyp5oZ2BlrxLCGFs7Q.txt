I love Nandos food! They are delicious. If you like hot hot hot salsa ask them for the salsa from the back.. Ohh its hot and tasty. I've had a lot here and love all the dishes. We usually end up with the same waitress which was crazy but great because she is fast with refills and food. We usually come for dinner.
