Big fan of this place! Went for lunch. Sat at the bar. Ordered 2 rolls, ramen and shishito peppers. Rolls were delicious. Shishito's were in too sweet of a sauce for me but my husband loved them. The brightest star was the Ramen. We've been trying it all over the country lately and this is the winner. Perfectly cooked, crispy pork belly and smoky mushrooms in savory broth. Jeremy was great and the Grapefruit cocktail and signature Margarita were perfect desert summer drinks. Oh, and manager came by to check on everything. We were at the bar so that doesn't happen often. Very cool!
