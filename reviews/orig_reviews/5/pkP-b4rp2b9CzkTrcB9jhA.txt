I crave this place when I'm in Vegas! Favorites: Fusion taco, fish taco, shrimp taco & their fried rice combo hits the spot. Home-cooked, savory goodness and my kind of comfort food starting at $1.29...you can't go wrong.  You guys wanna grub...then bring it on at Komex!  Bulgogi (Beef), Dak-gogi (Chicken), Daeji gogi (Pork) it's all good my friend!
