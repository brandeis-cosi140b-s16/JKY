I was completely surprised at this place.. It doesnt look like much from the outside, but when you go in - it's like a cathedral with tacos!! They have 180 different kinds of tequila... their chicken tacos were amazing! The managers and servers were extremely pleasant - if you're thinking about shots, go for the Tequila Flights instead of single shots, it's a much better deal! You will not be disappointed!
