There is not a bad thing on the menu. You must, must, must try the guacamole made table side. 

Their cochonita pabil which is seasoned pulled pork is also outstanding. If you are here from September to April, the fruit stuffed Chiles en Nogada is a must!!

I come here every time I come to Phoenix which I quarterly. They also have a location in the airport that delivers the same quality food but a smaller menu.
