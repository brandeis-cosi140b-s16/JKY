Great hidden gem of a restaurant!  Who'dathunk that Korean and Mexican cuisine would fuse into awesomeness for your mouth?  I highly recommend getting the beef bulgogi burrito with a side of kimchi.  Be sure to scope out their website for weekly specials.  You get a whole lot of food for what you pay for, which is cheap!  Don't let the location intimidate you; most great places are tucked away in the most unassuming places.
