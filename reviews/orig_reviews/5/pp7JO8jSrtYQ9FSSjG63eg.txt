Always have had wonderful service.   The food is authentic and amazingly tasty. You can have it "gringo" all the way up to"fire breather. "  they are perfect for gatherings,  casual dinner and even take reservations.  They don't skimp on the portion sizes either.   Dessert is delish.  They serve Pepsi products but also have a full service bar.
