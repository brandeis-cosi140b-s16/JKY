I see a lot of negative reviews here based on the bad customer experience.  Maybe it's because I lived in Chicago, but this has never even crossed my mind, especially when confronted with the incredibleness that is the stacked enchiladas.

Take a step back, order a sangria, snack on some chips and prepare your mouth... no--your whole body for this.  The first bite of these stacked enchiladas (always order them with green chile, might I add) will knock your socks off.  Literally.  (Side note: if you see one of my socks...)

The place has gotten a bit too busy, but it's still well worth the wait.  Or, for those not content to drink sangria while waiting for a table, you can check out the Mesa one; I've never had to wait long there, but it just doesn't have the same character.

I look forward to visiting the suburban sprawl that is the Phoenix metro area each year, and this is in no small part because of this place.  Los Dos makes a mean, spicy, enchilada.
