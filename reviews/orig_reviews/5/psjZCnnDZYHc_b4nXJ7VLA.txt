Javier took marvelous care of us! With city view seating we completely enjoyed chimichangas, (carnitas filled) table side guacamole, and creamy looking yummy tequila filled frozen margaritas. 

     The churros are yummy but their Flan is the Best In the Las Vegas valley!!!  Don't bother with their "fried " ice cream. Bleh!
