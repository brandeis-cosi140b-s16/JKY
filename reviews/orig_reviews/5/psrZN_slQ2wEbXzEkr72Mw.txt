A hidden gem in downtown. On your way to container park it's somewhat hidden but worth the search. Everything we tried was fantastic. We had the blood orange and the pear margaritas and they were amazing. You have to start out with the corn, it's a must. Everything entee we had tasted good, was beautiful and had complex flavors. The flan was the best I've ever had.
