Great place to come for tapas and drinks. Modern vibe and great menu selection. All of the tacos we had were good and the sushi was pretty good too. I would recommend coming here during happy hour because they have a great happy hour menu. The best thing I had was the crunchy tuna tacos. The atmosphere is very trendy and the service was great.
