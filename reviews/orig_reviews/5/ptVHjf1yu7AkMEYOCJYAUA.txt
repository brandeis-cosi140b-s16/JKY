Can I saw WOW?! My boyfriend and I found this little place on Sahara and we absolutely loved everything about it! We both got bowls with the steak and it was seasoned perfectly. DO NOT leave without getting some of their Chocolate Coconut Bark! It's heaven in your mouth. This place is a healthy option and comparable to Terriyake Madness or Chipotle but beats both by far.
