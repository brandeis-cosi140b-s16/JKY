I still think this place is awesome for LUNCH. I have been back multiple times including the lovely Julia's UYE I was not too happy that night and will probably never do dinner here again. But lunch people.....lunch I just have nothing to frign complain about everyone I take here loves it the guac the tomatillo sauce etc everything has been a hit except the veg synchronizada it was boring with just mushrooms but the harsh reality is that you would probably never order a synchronizada because you dont even know what it is. I'm sure the others with meat are much better. FYI they are like a quesadilla but much better with those home made tortillas!
