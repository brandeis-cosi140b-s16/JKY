Excellent  soup, great tasting enchiladas, tacos and the rice is different than in most Mexican restaurants. I have lived here for 16 years and just tried it a few months ago and is now my new place to go to. My wife judged the place from the exterior and looks are deceiving. Give it a try !! good chips and salsa too !!!
