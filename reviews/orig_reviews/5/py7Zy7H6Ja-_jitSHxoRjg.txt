3 for 3. Delicious every time! Brulee Burger is my FAV! It has a fried egg on it. Also has pickled onions, bacon, Havarti cheese and sugar cooked into the bun. I also have had the country fried burger which was really good too. They make their own spin on the country gravy sauce that has a very nice blend of herbs and spices. The next time I am going to try the Beach House burger that has a roasted green chili, smoked mozzarella and pico de Gallo. 

They also make their own bbq potato chips that have a bit of a kick to them. This is a really good burger joint. They have only been open a few months. Please go try them out so they can stay in business. It is a shame that really great places go under just because people do not know about them.
