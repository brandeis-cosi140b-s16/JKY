Let me start by saying their new manager Kim Gregory is on point. Being a long time Vegas local I appreciate good food and service. Their new manager is taking this restaurant to the level it should be at. Definitely a favorite place of mine to just grab a drink or perhaps a bite. Thank you Kim for making this place great again!! Also did I mention it's directly next door to the best strip club in Vegas!
