Love this place! I have never had a bad service experience and my food has always been delish! I love their fresh margs and the guacamole is amazing. It's never too busy, especially in the evenings, and the atmosphere is really laid back. 

The only complaint I have ever had was when the guy at the table next to us asked me if my margarita was as terrible as his. Apparently he couldn't taste any tequila at all but then I learned that his favorite spot for margs is Chili's so I think what he was missing was the flavor of sugar-infused margarita mix?!
