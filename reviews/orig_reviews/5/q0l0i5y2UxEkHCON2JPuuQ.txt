Food is awesome! I have eaten here more than a hundred times and the food never disappoints. For an appetizer, order the shrimp nachos. For entree, either the grilled chicken soft tacos or ultimate chimichanga. 

Despite what other people write, the drinks are AMAZING. The bartenders will make up drinks for you, just tell them what are you in the mood for. During football season there is breakfast available along with a Bloody Mary bar. Need I say more.... 
I have never had a bad experience here. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. But what sets this place apart from the rest are the fabulous drinks. Have Collins, Matt, or Joe create a drink for you.
