So far so good! We popped in while in the area and looking for some Happy Hour refreshment. Fantastic bartender who's been there since 1991 I believe and takes pride in his margarita recipe. Good company at the bar. Chips included with delicious spice sprinkled on, salsa, and bean dip. HH started at 2 and featured $3.50-$4 ritas and $5 apps. Can't wait to order some food next time!
