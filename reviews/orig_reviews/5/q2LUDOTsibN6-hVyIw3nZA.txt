Amazing. Really. We were driving back to LA and we're looking for a place to stop for a quick but yummy lunch.... Found this place on Yelp and I am so glad we stopped here. Best tacos I've ever had. Salsa bar is amazing. The waitress mixed up my order so I have no idea what I ate but it was phenominal. Seriously, you need to eat here.
