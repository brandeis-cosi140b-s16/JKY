Amazing experience! Came here with a group for to celebrate a birthday and everything was perfect from start to finish. The margaritas were the best we had our entire trip and we couldn't get enough of the chips and freshly made salsa. Everyone either ordered tacos or enchiladas and really enjoyed their meal. A birthday flan with candle was brought to our table to finish the meal. Our server, Willy, definitely made the dinner a memorable one. He was so enthusiastic and was very thorough spending time explaining the menu to us. We definitely will be back!
