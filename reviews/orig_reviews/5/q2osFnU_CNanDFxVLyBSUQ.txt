I have to say that I love PoPo's...OMG! The food reminds me of my mom's home cooking and I admit it I am sooo picky when it comes to Mexican food. I am not crazy about the Indian School Location, it's pretty ghetto but the food is awesome. I don't mind driving to the new location on Bell Road cuz it's way better. The staff could be a little more professional but most are GREAT. I am crazy for their salsa..
