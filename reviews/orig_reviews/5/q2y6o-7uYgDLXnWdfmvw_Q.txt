Great food, great drinks, great service, great atmosphere.  

It's a little pricier than your standard street-taco place.  The portions are human sized - not too huge - which means that you can try a few different things without being over-stuffed.  Each of the items we shared was truly great.  Guac, short-ribs tacos, fish tacos, carnitas, mac&cheese - all fantastic!  The flavors are a little more subtle than the in-your-face Mexican style that is familiar to Phoenix, but foodies should LOVE it.
