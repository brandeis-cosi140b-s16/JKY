Yes, this is as good as it gets.
I take the family on Sundays after church and the food has always been outstanding.  We lapsed for awhile but revisited on 10/17/2010 to find new signage (and later we find new ownership).  But the new owners very very wisely kept the menu!
The Toritos de Camaron are reason enough to go.  But everything else we've ever had is really really good too.  I go to Mazatlan 1-2 times a year and it's just like going back.  
This is not chain-Mexican or Tex-Mex...it's the real thing.  Do yourself a favor and try it out!
