WOW!! The Mission is incredible. One of the top 5 restaurants in all of Phoenix if you ask me. They hit on all cylinders, the food is awesome (try the pork shoulder) the ambiance is beautiful and inviting, the staff is knowledgable and attractive and the bar has great cocktails. Wine list could be a little more diverse but all in all one of the best places i've dined in Arizona. If you haven't been here you must go. Great place to have a nice dinner or take a date.
