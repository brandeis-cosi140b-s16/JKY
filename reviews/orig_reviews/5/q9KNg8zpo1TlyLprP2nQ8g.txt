Incredible. The restaurant is described as Mexican food on yelp and I think that is incorrect. There should be a category for amazing. I am from California and eat Mexican food weekly and have never had food like this. The flavors were intense and rich without being overwhelming. I had a pork dish that was Smokey and beautiful on the palate.  The management is exceptional. We were served by a gentleman named Michael who runs the service side of the restaurant and he was nothing short of perfect. In fact my car battery died when we left and when I went in to call AAA he came out and gave us a jump. The only downside is that its in Scottsdale and not in California. Keep up the good work.
