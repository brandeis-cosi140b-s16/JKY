Home made tortillas!!  Some of the best tortillas I've ever tasted and i grew up in the southwest.  price is cheap too.  i recommend ordering the Oaxaca (pronounced...Wahaka) burrito or the #13 combination plate.  The Oaxaca is filled with homemade chorizo, beans, potatoes and cheese.  The #13 plate comes with a beef enchilada, a beef taco, a bean tostada and beans and rice.  All for about $6.  Also, did I mention their tortillas are that good??  order the butter-tortillas for about 90 cents.

Place is located in the heart of the barrio, but around lunch time you'll find people from all walks of life in there.  firefighters, police officers, academic counselors, business men from corpo america, etc...
