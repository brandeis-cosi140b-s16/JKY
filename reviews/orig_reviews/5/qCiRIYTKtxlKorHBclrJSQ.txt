In an area of town with three sports bars on every corner, this slightly upscale Mexican restaurant is a nice alternative.  Service is quick and attentive, and the food is good.  They have a decent selection of tequilas, and the frozen margarita machine (which I usually avoid like the plague) actually produces a pretty good drink!   Four stars for food and service, plus a fifth for not being a sports bar!
