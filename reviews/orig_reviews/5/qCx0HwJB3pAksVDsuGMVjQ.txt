So i have a new friend in town from Texas.  We were in the mood for Mexican, however he said he wanted AUTHENTIC Mexican.  I had never been to Three Amigos but had seen the line out the door many times when I drive by.   After being super disappointed at a couple other competitors my last few visits, i suggested that we try this place.  we arrived at 6....and thankfully not a minute later because the  people started piling in....and there was LOTS OF THEM! .

We each had 2 margaritas. ...which set us up right.  Delicious and refreshing and provided a nice buzz.

Chips were pretty good and had Seasoning on them.  I like the fact that they serve their salsa in a deep bowl so you don't really run out quickly.  The salsa was not hot at all...however, the flavor was decent. 

We both got the Mixed Fajitas with Chicken, Steak and shrimp.  Perfectly seasoned, not greasy at all, and a mountain of food.   YUM!

We also had a complementary Empanada from the Yelp app.  It was basically deep fried ground  beef and queso.  Had good flavor when it was hot.....but we had so much food at the table, i only ate a couple bites of it.  

By the time we left....the restaurant was extremely packed with lots of people crowding the door which is by the bar...and everyone was getting their drink on.  But we never felt rushed to leave.

I will definitely go back for dinner here in the future....as it was authentic...and very good!

Been in CLT for 13 years .....hate ive not come sooner.
