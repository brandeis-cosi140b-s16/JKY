We had the BEST dinner & evening here!!! Tonight was their 2 year anniversary & we cannot believe we didn't know about this neat place before now & we only live 1 mile away!

Melissa was our Bartender & server...what a phenomenal human being! She's a full-time teacher & has been working nights & weekends here almost 2 years. The service was outstanding, the food was incredible & our drinks were ice cold & so good! The people on each side of us told us what they ordered & were raving about their food too!

Live music - a sharp dressed man was playing a guitar and sang so beautifully! The place was packed but we immediately had an open seat at the bar and no one had to wait more than 10-15 minutes for tables from our perspective. They are highly organized, clean restaurant & restrooms too!

Wow! We love family owned businesses & the Vasquez family has mastered perfection! This is our new favorite place in addition to Sushiya & we will be back at least once a week & will tell everyone we know about it too!
