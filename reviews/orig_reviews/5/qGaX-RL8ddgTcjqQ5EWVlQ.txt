This place is always always a must for me and my sisters when we're in Arizona. The staff is always so friendly and courteous and the food is delicious! My personal favorite is the carnitas torta. The bread is nicely toasted and it has plenty of meat. It may be a bit messy to eat but it's worth the mess! My sister ordered the Taquitos plate, which was just ok. My other sister got the chicken enchilada plate and it was pretty good. The enchiladas are stuffed with shredded chicken and it just had a home cooked meal feeling to it. The horchata is also delicious! 

I would highly recommend Roberto's. The atmosphere is great, the staff is super nice, the prices are decent and the food is GREAT!!!
