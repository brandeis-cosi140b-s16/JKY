This is my new hometown spot!  Just moved to Surprise a year ago and have fallen in love with Rio Mirage.  The service has been great each and every time, the food hot, delievred quickly, and the margs - yummy.  Affordable too.  My cousin and I hit up Rio Mirage every couple of months for margaritas and everytime, we get the coolest server.  They're so friendly and engaging.  I strongly recommend Rio Mirage!
