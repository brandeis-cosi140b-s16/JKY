I give the food five stars, but there are negatives to consider.

The food is amazing. The best mexican I've ever had this side of Cabo. This is as far from TexMex as you can get. Quality recipes. Complicated tastes. Truly elegant. This is high end cuisine. Service was impeccable. For great food you're going to pay though. Dearly. Lunch: an appetizer, two entrees, two iced teas and tip: $65.00. 

Now the negatives. Location: it is in a bad of town. I wouldn't want to be there after dark. I consider this to be a lunch only restaurant. Parking is behind the restaurant which makes a good shield for car burglars. The physical plant is very old. Not well kept. There is a single unisex bathroom which is incredibly small...as in dollhouse small. I was there at 2pm on a Friday. The bathroom had obviously not been serviced from the noon lunch rush. It needed a lot of attention. The restaurant is small overall and incredibly noisy. If you don't cater well to noise and close/crowded spaces, this restaurant is not for you.

This was my first visit. I will definitely go back. The pros outweigh the cons.
