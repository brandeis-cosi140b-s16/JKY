At first I was hesitant to try this place because I am not really a big fan of Mexican food, but this place surprised me. Combining chinese and Mexican food is a wow. Most of the food made authentic. The traditional Siomai was my favorite. They actually put gold on top. It was pretty good.They have weird names of soup but oh my god, taste so good. The dessert is also amazing, my favorite is the sticky rice with mango but with a twist. This place really surprised their customers. They are very creative. They have good customer service and they are ready to help you with your questions and orders. The place is Beside marquee. They have a comfortable lounge outside while waiting for your seAt and table. The service is fast and the food is incomparable. I will come back here and I will recommend this to my friends.
