Be sure to wear a burglar's mask, because once you see the bill, you will feel like you're robbing the place.

Everything is good. The shrimp and fish tacos are GREAT.

Three things I haven't seen mentioned:

First, the absolutely amazing wonton appetizer! It's a buck for four of them with more meat than you've ever seen in a regular ol' wanton. Unbelievably good. Seriously. Whatever combo of meat, spices, and onions they're using is fandamntastic! It's served with Thai sweet chili sauce and a little dab of the chipotle style salsa on top just takes it straight to the stratosphere!

Get one order per person or you'll end up screaming "MINES!!!!  MY PRECIOUSSSSS! Yous wants to takes it from me!" at your dining companions.

Next, Mr. B's Ghetto Ramen. Here's a big bowl of ramen noodles with some egg, onions, and a cut up hot dog in it. It's not a hot dog, though. It's an Asian mildly spicy sausage. My son ordered it and it was too spicy for him, so I took a stab at it after stuffing my face with three tacos.

Lastly, their iced tea rocks. I was pleasantly surprised to see Stevia in the Raw offered as their non-sugar sweetener.


The lady who owns the place is an absolute sweetheart! She's asking everyone where they live so they can consider another location. You will feel good supporting this family business.
