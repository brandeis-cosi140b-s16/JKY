Can't get enough of this restaurant hands down best Mexican restaurant in Surprise! The waiter was outstanding and very friendly. Chips and salsa always delicious. My wife and I had the tacos Mexicano with chicken and I had the steak, both had great flavor; rice and beans perfect. Definitely recommend this restaurant for locals or anyone in town looking for great Mexican food. $67
