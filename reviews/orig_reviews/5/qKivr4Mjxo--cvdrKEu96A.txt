so today was my husbands birthday, he turned 29 and was really not in the mood to celebrate. So my parents and i took him here to eat and our waitress was so nice and sweet about his grumpiness. When we told her it was his birthday he was less than thrilled but loosened up when we said he hates birthdays and she should wish him one and then make fun of him and maybe something else that wasn't as nice but never the less it made him laugh. She was a bright spot in his sad day, the food was really really great and service more than awesome. Good job Kim, go see Kim the server today she's great.
