Wow what can I say about this wonderful gem. One day driving with my lovely girlfriend we stumbled upon this awesome place and decided to be spontaneous and give it a look. We were greeted with a smile and great service. We had the Sonoran Torta and a some great drinks, we have been back since then on the night of a live band and lovely dancing. The vibe was amazing and so was our date. We will be back.
