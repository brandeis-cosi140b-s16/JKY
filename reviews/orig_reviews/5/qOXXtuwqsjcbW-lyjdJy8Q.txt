Awesome!!!  And we are from Southern California where Mexican food is everywhere.  But don't get turned away by the gentleman's club next door.  This beats our favorite places at home.  The tableside Guacamole was the best we've ever had.  They have a secret ingredient they won't share with us.  Boooooo...  Queso Fundido with Chirozo was excellent.  Cochinita Pibil and Al Pastor Tacos were tasty.  After the guacamole and the Queso we were already full but we ate on anyway. Goodness - It felt like we came out of a buffet.  And our service was excellent with Amber.  Thank you for a great meal and attentiveness.
