We were in the mood for some Mexican style food this weekend and after discussing some options decided to stop at SOL and wow are we happy we did. I'm giving this place 5 stars all around for the service, food, drinks, and interior. We started off the night with some margaritas which I had the cucumber jalapeno and pineapple serrano which both were spicy with a little sweetness they were great. They start you have with their round crispy tortilla chips and some bean dip with salsa while you order. For the entree I had the grilled fish zarandeado tacos which were packed with flavor and had pineapple as well. The great thing about the food is that SOL focuses on the quality of the food and not so much on the extras like cheese and sauces etc. Everyone in our group were exceptionally pleased with the entrees and appetizers. After the meal we had saw that there was a 100 year old Grand Marnier on the menu and had to see what it tasted like. It was so smooth and delicious! Sol is a one of the restaurants at the quarter that you must try and no matter what you try you'll be happy with and if you not sure ask the staff they were great with suggestions and pairing. Overall a wonderful great experience and we will definitely be going back.
