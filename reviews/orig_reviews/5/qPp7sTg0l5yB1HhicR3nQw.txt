One of the best burritos I have ever had! I ordered the Santisima burrito with shrimp and after waiting impatiently for it to cool down enough to eat it, I was amazed at the complex flavor explosion...I had a cute waitress who was made sure I had everything and checked back often. The salsa bar is THE BEST I have ever encountered, I tried 4, which was about 1/4 of them, and was blown away by the Pecan Salsa, WOW....I wanted to try a marg but went with a beer, gives me a reason to come back....Very cool interior and a decent variety of beers and Tequilas...
