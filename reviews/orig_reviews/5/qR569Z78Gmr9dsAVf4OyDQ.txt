I love this place. The enchiladas in green tomatillo are superb, the tomatillo is more sour and spicy (which I love), but using the cheese they do balances out the flavors. They have great beans and rice. But, my personal favorite has to be huevos rancheros. I have a hard time ordering anything else. 

I visited Restaurant Mexico the night before last with a friend who was craving Mexico City style. We were fully satisfied. What we didn't realize is that we came in just before closing. But, we didn't feel rushed at all. In fact, they refilled our bowl of chips and salsa when the food came out. 

I've lived in Mexico City and the flavors here are the closest I've found in Phoenix to the food I would eat there. This in mind, the sauces accent the flavors of the chiles and tomatoes more simply and without sugar. Sour and bitter flavors can be part of the overall allure of these type of sauces, hence the "watery" salsa that comes out with the chips. It is a simple tomato and chile salsa without frills, but that is the style.  

The only complaint I have is the enchiladas are a traditional small size. That said, I could probably eat a platter full.
