This place is awesome. Tried it opening night.
We've eaten at a lot of celebrity chef places; batali, flay, morimoto, yamaguchi, bastianich, lagasse, etc and this place easily fits in at that level of quality and service. We'll be back many times and we will bring friends and family. Gotta check it out.
