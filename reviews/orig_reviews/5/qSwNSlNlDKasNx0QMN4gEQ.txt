I didn't know this location existed until suggested for dinner. When we walked in the place was packed, we were told the wait would be 10-15 minutes but within less than 5 we were seated.Brett our waiter quickly had chips, 2 kinds of salsa & drinks out and we were served our quesadilla appetizer in a matter of minutes. I ordered the Pollo Rico with jalapeno cream sauce, so good but so much that I got to take some home for lunch the next day, which turned into a midnight snack just too good to wait. I tried a bite of my son's Faja pasta dish, ordered that a few weeks later at another location. Even though we didn't finish our food we still shared the sopapillas, that came with whip, honey & chocolate sauce, messy but oh so worth it. Fabulous food & service, we'll definitely be back!
