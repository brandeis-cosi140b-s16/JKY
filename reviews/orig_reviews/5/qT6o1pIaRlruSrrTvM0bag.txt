I must say, I like a challenge.

So when I saw "I'll make a deal with you. Read my review. Read the other reviews. Then go to Three Amigos, and come back and tell me I was wrong. I will print any compliment I get about Three Amigos." in comparison to so many good reviews, I had to check it out.

I'm back, and I'm telling you you're wrong.

This is authentic Mexican.  Yes, the waitresses spoke more Spanish than English.  But who cares when the food is delicious?

My margarita was wonderful - perfectly salted rim, not too strong but enough that I felt it.  Plus, I got a t-shirt with it for Cinco de Mayo!

The chips are tasty, not too thin but not too thick, with a unique seasoning.  I enjoyed the salsa, the green spicy salsa, and the even spicier new red chile salsa (sneaky spicy!).  I ordered the enchilada/tostada combinacion, and the waitress (correctly) made a suggestion that I swap my meat options for each (asada and chicken) and I appreciate that heads up.  
I love getting fresh avocado on top of my tostada.  Their beans are delicious.  The rice was tasty.  Their enchilada sauce was delectable.

I did not try their guacamole, so I cannot compare that to Azteca.  But where my entree is concerned, I would def prefer Three Amigos.

Overall, I had a great experience and would def go back again.  Keep in mind this is more hole-in-the-wall Mexican vs. 1511 Cantina "fancy" Mexican, but I think each definately have their place in my heart.

And I want to go back today for $.99 tacos at lunchtime.
