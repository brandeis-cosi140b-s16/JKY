Guess what???  This restaurant has a menu printed online, if you think it's too expensive-don't go. Oh yeah, if your server screws up (and it will happen) but the manager fixes it and comps your meal- don't write a 1 star review. 

This place is great!  Great food and margaritas!  I still dream about the short ribs. I hate when bad reviews happen to good restaurants. I hope no one lost a job. Come on people
