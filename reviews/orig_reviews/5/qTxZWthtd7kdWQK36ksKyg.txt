This place was awesome!  We are frequent visitors of Mexico and love everything about the country - and this was the next best thing.  We ordered the chips. carne asada burrito, carne asada taco, pollo asada taco, and a vegi loco papas.  They were all SO good!!!  The lemonade was killer and hubby enjoyed drinking a Mexi Coke out of the bottle.  Killer lunch for two?  Well under $20.
