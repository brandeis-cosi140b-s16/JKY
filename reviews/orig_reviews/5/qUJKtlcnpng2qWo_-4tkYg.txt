I'll tell you what, this place looks like nothing from the outside, but when you get inside, you will discover the best service I have had in three years of living in vegas, that includes restaurants that cost 3x as much.   The food is outstanding, Their chicken mole is out of this world good.

Don't miss out on their mojitos, better than any restaurant in key west!
