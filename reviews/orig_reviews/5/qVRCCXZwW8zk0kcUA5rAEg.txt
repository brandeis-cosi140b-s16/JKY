The food is extremely delicious. Service is excellent. Only downfall is they don't have any alcohol at the moment. According to the excellent waitress this restaurant has been open for 6 months and they are currently working on there liquor license. I can't wait to come back when they offer Micheladas! 
I Definitely recommend this delicious, fresh food!
