My wife and I have been to this place twice already. We've tried the bowls and the tacos.  Nothing has disappointed. The service is pretty great and the ambience is fun.  The tacos are decent sized and jam packed with flavor. I thought the adobo chicken bowl was awesome.  Seriously awesome. My only criticism was that it wasn't spicy enough. But you can change that by getting their salsa. I had it with chips. It had nice heat and was super chunky. I could definitely make this a regular place to go.
