Have you ever been to a restaurant, and then dreamed about repeating a wonderful experience? No? I must be sleep deprived. Or hungry...

I probably would never had tried this restaurant if it hadn't been for my friend that lives in Gilbert. We met for a little shopping and lunch, and decided to try TQLA. 

The restaurant is nicely decorated, and the outside patio is super cute! 

We split the steak fajitas, and OMG! they were so good! 

The meat, I believe, is ribeye, and was very tender and flavorful. What makes it even better is that when the sizzling platter comes to your table, there is a little butter on top of the meat (YUM!). There was a little cup of something on the side that we thought was a flavored butter, and we just plopped it right on top, and it was really tasty (we think it may be an ancho butter, and it was really good). 

The personnel are very nice and attentive, as well. 

Anyway, I'm dreaming of those fajitas. Every night.
