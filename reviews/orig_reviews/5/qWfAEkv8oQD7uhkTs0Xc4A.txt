is there anything in life the vegan nachos at tex tubb's wouldn't make better, i wonder?
yesterday, i put it to the test......

i came out of a job interview with my head ready to explode and when i looked up into the heavens and asked, what do i need? show me where to go....  tex tubb's was the answer.
ahhhh....yes.  if i was norman and i had a cheers, this could be it. 

i just needed a soft place to land, with pretty colored lights strung around window sills, tattoed (and cute) servers and a nice little bar that didn't have a tv blaring in my face or some guy 'hey babying' me.....and more pretty colored lights.  the retro chairs helped take me back in time and i could start to forget that i had just had a very grown-up experience.

this is veg comfort food to my nth degree.  crispy, fatty, salt-kissed chips with some nice gooey 'cheese' and an amazing cilantro sour cream substitute all piled super high....it makes me feel like i'm being extra good to myself. 
       "go ahead, you're worth it,"  they whisper to me.
 
as i try to eat them somewhat strategically - the right ratio of bean, tomato, cheese, lettuce, olive, corn, sour cream to chip - they are messy, crunchy and yuuuummmmmyyyyyy.  i can think of nothing else and THAT was exactly what i needed.
