There's a reason that the three, two and one star reviews don't even amount to the four or five star reviews. I guess it just takes a certain kind of person to enjoy Cafe Rio for the amazing goodness that it is. I can taste the freshness of everything I've ever had from here, and really hope they open up more locations when I move out of town!
