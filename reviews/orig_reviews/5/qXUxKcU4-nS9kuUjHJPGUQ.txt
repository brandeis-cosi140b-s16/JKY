My husband and choose to sit at the bar and have drinks and apps for dinner. The bartender made a couple of suggestions and they were spot on. Yummy you have to try the jalepino popper and shrimp wrapped in bacon oh my stars I'm going back for more. The margarita was spot on. Nice ambiance prices as expected service perfect.
