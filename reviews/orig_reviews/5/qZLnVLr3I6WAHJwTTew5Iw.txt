Upon entering this welcome dojo of culinary flair I was welcomed by the GM on the floor as he could sense my haste. I was sat directly at the high top bar on the right of the entrance front and center(ish). I enjoy sitting here as you get to feel the heat from the center burners and watch your meal being prepared (depending on what you order).  You also have front row seats to how they prepare their fresh guacamole. It's a lot of fresh avocados and a whole lot of smashing / whisking. I usually order tacos as they fire quick and the flavor profiles are robust. This trip I ordered two Silencio (duck tongue with lychee) and one Viva China (beef tendon with an oyster). The flavors of the duck tongue and lychee compliment each other quick nicely and leave me craving more. The beef tendon has a very intricate prep where each bite you take (3 should be norm) you are left with thin crispy salty crunch bombs that are mixed with the oyster's natural sea water flavor.  Overall extremely umami and it's hard for me to order anything else when I come back....and I will.
