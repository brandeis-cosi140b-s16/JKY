This place exemplifies the idea of service! We walked in, and the place was booked for the entire night. It was 4:30 pm on a Saturday night! The hostess agreed to find us a seat, thankfully, as we were away from our normal hood and excited to return to Blue Adobe. We have been here several times and we love it! The food and service was outstanding! Our server, Jessica, was attentive and awesome! Our food was quick and yummy. The drinks were superb. Go here, you will not regret it!
