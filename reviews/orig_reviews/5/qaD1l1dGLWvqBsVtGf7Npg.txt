Love this restaurant and the new location! Everything from the decor to the food is fantastic. So happy that they have moved to a better location. I tried the soft tacos and guacamole. The chips and salsa are the best . I have also had the tamales which are delicious. Food is fresh and service is great. Will return soon. There is a great outdoor patio that I look forward to sitting at when the weather improves.
