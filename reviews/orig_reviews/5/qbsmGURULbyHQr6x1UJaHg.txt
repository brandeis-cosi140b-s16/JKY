Mundo is awesome.  Everything was great and we sampled a lot of the menu--the skewers were awesome and the guacamole is a do not miss.  I was fortunate because the night we dined at Mundo, the special was the pork chop.  I know that a pork chop is sometimes not that inspiring; however, this pork chop was divine.  The restaurant is beautiful--great atmosphere.  I only wish I could have had more time at Mundo and that there was a Mundo in my city.
