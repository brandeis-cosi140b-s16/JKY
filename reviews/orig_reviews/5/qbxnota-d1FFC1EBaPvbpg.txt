Not much to say about Valle Luna that hasn't been said. In my opinion Valle Luna represents Sonoran-American food as well or better than any other establishment in AZ. This is not "authentic" Mexican cuisine per se, but it is the authentic Sonoran food all of us valley natives (gringos and chicanos alike) grew up eating. Always great service and specials to boot. 

Get your arses up there, you pinche gabachos!
