Okay, so I am just a huge fan because of their Thursday Ladies day/night.  That's right, all day, all night  half price appetizers and drinks.  That would be ALL appetizers and ALL drinks!  

What a great deal!  

The food is okay, but I really liked the pineapple/chipotle margarita.  It was sweet but had a back-end kick.  Yum!
