Raised in Oklahoma with real Mexican food, this is a good as it gets.  We drive from the Marvin area weekly to enjoy the food.  The green salsa for the chips is amazing albeit a tad on the hot side.  Tacos are like eating street food in Baja.  Carnitas are spot on, and the guisado is like the little old woman down the street made from my childhood.  Teamwork makes for quick service, and the kitchen executes with great speed.
