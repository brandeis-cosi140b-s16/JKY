Sketchy neighborhood--Check..
Outstanding food--Triple check!!!  with many stars.  
Had the (huge) mixed seafood ceviche as an appetizer and mentioned to the owner that I usually made it at home with lime and I didn't taste any in his.  He explained that his mother (the cook) used a tomato based sauce for the mixed seafood ceviche and a lime based sauce for the shrimp--and that next time I was in that I could ask for the lime sauce if I wanted it.  Neato!  

Everything was exceptional and we left stuffed --and with a doggie bag for morning.

Will be back..
