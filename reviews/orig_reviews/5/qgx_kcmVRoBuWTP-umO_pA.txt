What a fine establishment. Words can not seriously describe how special this place is to me. I always, always, always take a new date here. Hands down, The Rokerij, is in my opinion the only place that sets the mood, provides the food, and will make the ladies drool. 

I can't afford to go there much, but it will forever be my favorite "first date" restaurant.
