I've been coming to Viva Mercado's with the family for almost 22 years in their various locations.  Many birthday dinners over the years. It was always my favorite Mexican restaurant in LV.  I was so sad when the Rainbow location closed, and looked forward to Bobby's promise of a return some day.  Our first visit to the new Sahara location felt like we finally came home again.  If possible, the food seemed better.  The restaurant is beautiful inside, and the service was excellent. A nice strong Margarita was also very welcome

Congrats to Bobby and everyone in the family for a triumphant return.  You can NEVER close again!!!
