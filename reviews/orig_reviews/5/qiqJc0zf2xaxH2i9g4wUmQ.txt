i really like loco patron! they have bomb fish tacos and their margaritas are really good too! im not sure what kind of flavoring thing they use but it's really sweet so you can get a skinny version margarita and it's still delish! 

service is decent. they are quick with the waters and chips and salsa when u sit down. food comes out quickly too. 

great happy hour and lunch specials. big fan of loco patron
