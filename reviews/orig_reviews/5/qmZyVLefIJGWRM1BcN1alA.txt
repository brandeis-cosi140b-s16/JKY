Well... couldn't help it... gotta bump this up to a perfect five stars after our last visit. Our first visit we tried every taco on the menu... this time we tried a quesadilla, an Oaxacan Black Mole Burro, and for good measure a regular old bean burrito because we wanted to try their beans. On top of that I just had to get another 'Dogfish Shark' taco because it was my favorite, and instead of the Horchata we tried their Jamaica drink...mmm. 

The quesadilla was very different, made with a really thick corn tortilla with sour cream drizzled all over it... damn good. Perfect to tear pieces off of and dip in the different salsas. The two burros we tried were equally tasty... and just like last time the chips were spot on. What's not to love about this place? It's just one of those 'easy to fall in love with' little holes in the wall. 

I think I'd give just about anything for them to start selling their salsa's to-go... especially after our last visit and finally being able to try the much talked about strawberry salsa; it really is as good as everyone says it is... heaven in a sauce basically. Whoever the mad scientist is behind these salsas really deserves a pat on the back, because I'm hooked. 

From what I've been hearing this place is slowly starting to get busier and busier... it puts a smile on my face to see good food and good businesses succeed based on word of mouth. In my ideal world there'd be a La Condessa on every other corner, instead of a Taco Bell... eh, baby steps I guess. 5/5.
