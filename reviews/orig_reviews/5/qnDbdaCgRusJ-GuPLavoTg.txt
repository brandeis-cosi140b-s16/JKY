This review is for lunch only.  Both of my visits were on days with perfect weather. The doors of the dining room were opened up to the patio and the Scottsdale Mall.  It was a gorgeous setting.

They have an outstanding lunch deal.  For $15 you get a drink, chips and salsa, an appetizer and a main course.  The quality of the food and flavors are all top notch.

The highlight for me was the posole soup.  Huge chunks of pork belly and a few little neck clams in a flavorful broth.  I also tried the red snapper fish tacos and the carne asada. Both were delicious.

For $15 it was such a great value I almost felt guilty.  Almost.
