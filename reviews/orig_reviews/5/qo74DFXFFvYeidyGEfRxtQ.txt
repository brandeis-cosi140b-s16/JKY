Five stars all the way for our first visit! We both had the tacos which were fantastic!! The chips and salsa were homemade and delicious! The topping on the cake was that we showed up impromptu 5 minutes before they closed but they stayed open and made us a delicious mexican dinner!! Plus, the outdoor seating in downtown mesa makes for some awesome scenery!  Enjoy!!
