Yes-- I am addicted to Cafe Rio. When I found out there was a location not far from my house I flipped out. I thought there was only the Henderson location. I plan on becoming a regular here.

My review is pretty much the same as the other location. These places are pretty much the exact same. 

I love that they have daily specials. Those are really good deals. But once I tried that Chicken Tostada Salad it was over for me. I never order anything else. It is the perfect amount of chicken, cheese and beans of your choice. They pile high the fresh lettuce and top it with Pico and Sour Cream and a few Tortilla Chip Strips. The creamy dressing is my favorite.

This location does not seem to be as busy as the Henderson location. I think the location might be bad. You will barely notice it from the street and it is also in the same shopping center as Chipotle. The staff was really friendly and helpful. The restaurant was also very clean and they had someone out there washing tables as soon as the guest would leave. Great location, great food!
