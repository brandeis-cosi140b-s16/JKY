I love Mexican food and this place is the bomb!  Went in a party of five.  Everyone got something different and everyone loved their meal.  Best Mexican food I've had anywhere.  
The service was excellent - friendly and helpful.  
The price of our meal came out to less than what we paid for our hotel's crap dinner buffet and was of far better quality. 
 It's worth traveling off the strip for that's for sure.
