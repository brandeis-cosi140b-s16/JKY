Tell me why they dont have a location in southern California? !?!

This is the chipotle of enchiladas! !! How much better can it get? 

I got 2 enchiladas with green sauce. Ine was potato  (my fave) and the 2nd was brisket. They were fire grilled in a neat ceramic looking plate bowl. Absolutely delicious! 

I will for sure come back!
