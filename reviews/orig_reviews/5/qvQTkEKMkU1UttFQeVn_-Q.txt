First time here earlier this week.  Wow ... this place is amazing.  New Mexico fare.  It's small just like some of the reviewers mentioned.  But it's perfect for two.  We had four in our party and we didn't have to wait very long.  The waiter was so nice and answered all our questions.  Yes, the food is spicy.  Yes, the food has a smoky flavor.  Yes, it's all good.  Perfect!  It's dark and romantic with candles burning.  And the bar seating looked awesome (you can watch them cooking).  I had the Carne Adovada (generous amount of melt in your mouth spicy pork with rice and beans).  Hey, I can eat, but I ended taking half of mine home.  Hubby had the Skewers.  He said they were really good and he'd order them again.  I'd go back in a minute.  Next time I want to try the bacon wrapped shrimp.  This would be a great place to show out of towners what Phoenix is really about.
