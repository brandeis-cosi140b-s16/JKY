I have frequented this place many times and have never had a bad meal. I absolutely LOVE , LOVE there Steak Supreme Tacos . First off all they start with a homemade flour tortilla that is lightly grilled to perfection , they proceed to stuff it full with juicy marinated steak , mozzarella cheese , roasted anaheim salsa and then top it off with cilantro , it also comes with refried beans and Mexican rice . This Supreme Taco is very moist and sooooo amazing . It's definitely my favorite menu item . I've also had the Seasoned Ribeye , and OH MY GOD , it was perfectly seasoned and so tender that it melted in my mouth . They are not a steak house so I was surprised as to how delicious the Ribeye was . I'm going to say its one of the best I've ever had here in Las Vegas . 
The local vibe here is great and the service was perfectly on key . My drink is always kept full and the staff is very personable . You must come by and try this place out !!
