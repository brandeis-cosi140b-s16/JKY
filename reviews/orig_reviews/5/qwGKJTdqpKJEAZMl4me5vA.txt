I was here!  Guy Fieri came earlier than me as well!

The best modern Mexican and first Mexican place we went to in Phoenix.  This place is a hit!

The service was slow and they forgot our drink orders a few times.  But the tequila they suggested was good.

Here comes the most important part.. their food.  We ordered their shark taco to share.  I had their El Gaucho Burro and my wife had their El Gaucho Quesa.  My wife is not a big quesadilla fan, but she liked it and it was so good when I tried it!  Her quesa had the perfect crisp texture to each bite.  My burro was excellent.  Since we both had El Gaucho, the fillings were the same ingredients.  Here's the climax.  They put cucumbers and bell peppers into their El Gaucho Burro and Quesa; that is a genius idea!  Those 2 ingredients brang out the taste of each individual ingredient from our burro and quesa.

Man, it was good!

Prices are good.

They have their own salsa bar.  I recommend their creamy cilantro salsa.  They also have good spicy ones as well.

A chips refill for your chips and salsa will cost you about $2?

Oh yeah, this place is pretty small.  They try to utilize as much as they can.

Very rare you will find Chinese eating Mexican, but I saw a few here.

Got to come here.
