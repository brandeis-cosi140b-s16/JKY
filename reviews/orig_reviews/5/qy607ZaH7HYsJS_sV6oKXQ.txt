We love Tivoli Village and are always looking for somewhere new to go. First time we ate there it was nothing short of delicious!! Service was friendly and helpful with out being pushy or intrusive. They told us about happy so we came back. They have an early happy hour as well as a late night. Even on FRIDAYS!!! So good and what a great deal. It's only in the bar but always great service. So much so we frequent there quite often. Oh did I forget to mention the do a great brunch with a free bloodymary or mimosa!! I'm jus say'n you gotta go.....
