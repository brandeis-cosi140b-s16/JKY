As I suspected, our last trip here was an anomaly.  Had the absolutely divine sweet corn tamales, chili rellenos, shrimp rellenos tacos with sangria margarita and classic margarita. Just no words to describe how absolutely perfect everything was!  And the wait staff was amazing as well. Attentive without being obtrusive. A must eat in Vegas, without a doubt!
