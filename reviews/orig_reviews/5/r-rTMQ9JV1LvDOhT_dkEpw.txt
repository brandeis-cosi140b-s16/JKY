Had lunch there yesterday with friends who just moved to Phoenix. Let me just say that the service and food is EXCEPTIONAL. Mission is one on my favourite restaurants and has a fabulous bar as well. 
Their margaritas are lovely and thy have lots of options.
The food is to die for. Staff are VERY friendly, attentive to patrons, and provide some of the BEST service I've had from restaurants in this area.
