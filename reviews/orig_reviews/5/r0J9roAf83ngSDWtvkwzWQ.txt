This is such a great hole in the wall type restaurant. They have four types of salsa that they serve to start your Mexican dinner. All four taste amazing. My favorite salsa in town! Their food is also very good and authentic. Sometimes the service can be a little slow, but trying all four of the delicious salsas will keep you busy. :)
