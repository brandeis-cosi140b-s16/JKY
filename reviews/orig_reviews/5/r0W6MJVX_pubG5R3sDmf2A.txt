Sweet god of obesity. If I lived within walking distance to Paz Cantina, they'd have to roll me out the door on a nightly basis. 

Where do I even begin? The food is incredible. The carne asada nachos are the absolute best you'll find anywhere in Phoenix. Guaranteed.  It's topped with refried beans, crema, and some of the best guac around. The carne asada is always juicy and flavorful and available in street taco and burrito portions. The pork belly taco is a crispy, juicy religious experience. The nopales taco is also a delicious vegetarian option, and the fish taco is sublime with pickled veggies, a teeny sliver of jalapeno, and crispy, juicy fish. The dangerous liason drink will get you lit and feeling fantastic. Even the free chips and salsa are exceptional. 

The ambiance is trendy, the staff friendly, but the food is what will keep you coming back for more. I usually go on Sunday nights and they have a DJ out front and the music is loud. I find the atmosphere enjoyable, but if you're not into loud music visiting Paz on the other nights of the week is quieter and enjoyable as well.
