Loved this place!  A little tardy on my review, but had to make sure I got this one in, especially after how well we were treated.

First off, this restaurant is NEXT TO the Sapphire gentlemens club, not in it.  So don't let that spook you away.  We took our 10 and 13 year old there and were a little scared walking up to the place since the huge Sapphire sign was screaming at us "are you sure you wanna take your kids here?".  Answer: YES, YES WE DO. They have a kids menu and the server was more patient than I've ever been with my OCD and ADHD 10 year old.  So don't shy away from this place because you have kids.

Second, BEST FLAN EVER! Got the free flan with Yelp check in deal, and I'm really glad I did. Although this may be a crack dealer trick because now I'm going to have to go back there every time I'm in Vegas to get that damn flan. I believe the chef said it was his grandmother's recipe and it was awesome. It's got a very creamy texture as opposed to the usual vanilla jello stuff I get everywhere else.

Third, I've read some concerns over the salsa here.  Not sure if that's just an old review and things have changed since then or what, but they gave us 3 different salsas to choose from and all of them were very good.  The two more mild salsas weren't that hot at all, but very tasty.  The habanero salsa, too hot for my weak butt, but I'm assuming it's right up your alley if you like your salsa spicy.

Fourth, I wish I was a local.  This place has great locals deals on Monday (everything half off), and Thursdays (all you can eat street tacos and draft beer $20). They get pretty packed for those nights, so either go off peak or make a reservation.

Lastly, the service was really very good. Like I said before, our server was very good and awesome with our kids. The chef came out at one point and spent a good 5-10 minutes just talking with us about the food, our visit to Vegas, and future visits. I believe the manager also came over to check on us as well.  All around you could tell they were making the effort to make sure everyone was having a good dining experience.  

-If you're going to Sapphire anyways...GO HERE
-if you're a local...GO HERE (especially Mon or Thur)
-if your visiting and want something off the strip and different...GO HERE
-if you enjoy a creamy, custard-like flan in your face hole...GO HERE

Thanks for a great night out for my family.  You totally earned this rave review.
