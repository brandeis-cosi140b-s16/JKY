OMG...the best mexican street style food I've had in ages.  There were 6 in our group. We all had different items...every single one of us was super happy with our choices.  I'm not sure they have anything bad there.
If there's a low spot, and it's not that low, is the seating would be an issue if they were busy.  There is outdoor seating and approximately 20 seats inside. 

Other than that (seating) we would have given this place more the a 5 if possible!

One last thing this was the lowest cost meal we've ever had in Vegas.
