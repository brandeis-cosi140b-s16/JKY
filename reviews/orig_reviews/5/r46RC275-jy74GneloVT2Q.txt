I love this place!  You order burritos with whatever ingredients you choose. I got a burrito with guacamole, tomatoes, corn, lettuce, onion and ground beef - everything was fresh and delicious. I also ordered a side of the plantains which were also amazing. Everyone was very helpful.  I don't usually like burritos but this place definitely changed my mind.
