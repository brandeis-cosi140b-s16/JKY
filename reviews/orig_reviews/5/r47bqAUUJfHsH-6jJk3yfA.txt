Amazing, flavorful, delicious, mouthwatering, best, mouth-gasm... 
These are a few words that popped into my head while eating here.
Their food is amazingly flavored and well made. I would eat here everyday if I were closer.
One downside is that they have a "no firearms allowed" sign on their door. That's the only thing that pissed me off. Buuuuuut... I did come here for food, not target practice.
