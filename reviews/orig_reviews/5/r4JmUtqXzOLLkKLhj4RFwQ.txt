Awesome.

That's all I have to say.  

I had the Chili Relleno...fully expecting it to be fried and gloopy like it is in most restaurants.

Their take was unexpected...and welcome.

Roasted poblano, split open all the way, to basically make a bed for a nice sized portion of beef filling...which was spiced just right, with tomato and slivered almonds...an interesting texture that was unexpected and really quite nice!

The sauce, was just fantastic...I can't even describe it well enough to do it justice.

Just...if you're in Vegas...try this place.  It's really very tasty.

The service is friendly to boot...it looks all trendy and posh, and I expected it to be a douche-bag fest.

But it was really friendly, relaxed, and well-worth the money.
