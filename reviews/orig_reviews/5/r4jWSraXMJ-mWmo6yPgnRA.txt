OMG!!! This place has AMAZING food. My husband and I love Mexican food and we asked around for a good place and everyone told us to go here. The customer service was AWESOME. First they bring out salsa and warm beans Delicious! Then a tomato soup....yummy not your typical soup so please don't pass it up. My husband ordered the burrito Binico. He almost hurt himself because he couldn't stop eating it. I ordered the chicken enchiladas they were so good, so many flavors exploding in your mouth. Normally enchiladas are dry but not these, they were moist and very saucy. 

After my husband and I were Thanksgiving stuffed they had a complimentary shuttle to take us back to our hotel. If you are ever in Vegas you must try out the Original Lindo Michoacan on Desert Inn Rd you will never see Mexican food the same way because you will always be in search of their spices.
