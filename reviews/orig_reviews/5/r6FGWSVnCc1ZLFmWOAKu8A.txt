Loved the food. Being a chickenitarian I would like more options as I don't eat red meat or most fishes. But they do have some vegan options. I am also gluten intolerant so that makes it more tough. But compared to many other places I had more stuff to eat here. Very posh and elite ambience. We sat outside and enjoyed. It was pretty full for a weekday 9:30pm. It's open till 11 pm which is amazing!
