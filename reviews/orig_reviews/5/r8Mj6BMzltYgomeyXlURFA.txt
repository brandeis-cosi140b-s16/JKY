The food is amazing!  Very authentic.   I felt like I was in the heart of Mexico.   Our server, John, was more than kind and very a tentative. Loved the tocos, and the bowl was a very innovative.   Homemade torrtillas chips.  I was thrilled with the meat selection and the red and green salsa.   We'll be back for sure! !
