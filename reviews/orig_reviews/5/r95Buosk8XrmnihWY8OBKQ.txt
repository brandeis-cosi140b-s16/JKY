Los Sombreros is the best authentic Mexican food in the valley.  That is a bold statement, especially with offerings like Barrio Caf√©, but the attention to detail, authenticity and one of the coziest patios around makes Los my favorite Mexican spot. We have been several times and always order the same thing so this time around we thought we would try one of the new items on the menu.  I am so glad we did. We started with the crepes appetizer and the fig & panela salad. The crepes were amazing. They were filled with goat & blue cheese and had a delicious pomegranate sauce on top. The salad with figs had a honey lime dressing that was divine.  My husband usually gets the seafood crepes but had the Ribeye instead.  He was totally obsessed! He loved that it was covered with a chipotle and pineapple salsa. And of course every time we go we have to get their tasty margaritas and the chips and guacamole. You can't go wrong with those!
