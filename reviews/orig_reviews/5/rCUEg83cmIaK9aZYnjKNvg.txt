Tried this for the first time with my friend that was visiting from SF. There's a bunch of cheap places in sf, but he said he would love to have this place again and def hasn't tried anything like it.

I tried the fusion chimichanga with bulgolgi and shared the bulgolgi bachos. These nachos are on point and definitely worth the price. The chimichanga was okay, but I think i should have just gotten a burrito. It was kind of oily and I think it was his the outside I wasn't feeling. 

The service was great. We got there when they opened so they were definitely attentive. They checked on us enough, but not too much that it constantly interrupted our conversation. I would definitely recommend this place for some good cheap food!
