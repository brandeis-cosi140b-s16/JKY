:::::PROS:::::

Clean, clean, clean.  The cooking environment, the floor, the condiment area, the tables - all spotless.

Cheap, cheap, cheap.  Most burritos are in the 3-dollar range, and you can't beat the quality for the price.  The chicken burrito incorporated medium spicy shredded chicken done just right, and the breakfast burrito used eggs, ham, cheese, onions, and green peppers to get it done.

Breakfast served all-day!  I know other Mexican restaurants do the same, but given the fact Fiesta Burrito is tantalizingly tasty, it just sweetens the deal.

Great Pico De Gallo, and Red Sauce at the condiment bar!  Need I say more?

:::::CONS:::::

None.

Fiesta Burrito is nice and bright on the inside, and so seemed it's staff.  I believe the crew were truly enjoying themselves the day I went in and the smile on the man's face while washing the floor was refreshingly genuine and sincere.  Its obvious that its a well-run establishment, but its also one of those places that makes me wonder because the food IS so cheap...

Seriously.  How can places like J in the Box and McD's sell Chicken Sammies for a buck?  And the three dollar burrito?  I just can't see the profit margin...  But then again, I've never run a restaurant.  I mean - Fiesta's ingredients can't be that cheap, right???

Regardless, Fiesta Burrito is great bargain, and the food that I've tried so far knocked my socks clean off.  Check it out.
