This place is what chipotle would like to grow up to be. Everything isvfresh, fast and however you want it. I love that they will put anything on anything that you want! I like some enchilada sauce on my nachos thank you, and they put it on for me! Getting a salad but don't want the big hunks of lettuce they use? Ask for the shredded lettuce, you'll get it. I like that you can customize your order because I'm a custom orderer. The prices are great for the huge amount of food you get and the staff is always pleasant. It dies get loud inside but that's because it's a  popular, casual place. I wouldn't change a thing.
