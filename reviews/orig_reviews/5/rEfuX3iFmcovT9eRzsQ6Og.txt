What a sweet accident! We happened upon this place while we were desperate for a place to eat a quick dinner. We were seated on the small patio. The tacos are AMAZING!  The Pork al Pastor is great, but the Fish Taco is out of this world! Further, the integrity of the management and wait staff is really commendable. I left a bag with something valuable within on the back of my chair (on the patio)  and didn't notice til I was at the airport. I called the manager, who had it, and I was able to retrieve it without difficulty. And the manager would not take the cash I offered.  If I ever get back to Vegas, I will stop here again. And leave a big tip.
