What a delicious surprise in a little strip mall. Food was delicious and extremely cheap. Husband and wife owned and operated. The wife did all of the faux painting and decorating as well as the delicious cooking. The dishes were beautiful and we sat outside. Small place, not a lot of seating. I see a new location in their future. With yummy affordable food like this, I highly recommend this eatery.
