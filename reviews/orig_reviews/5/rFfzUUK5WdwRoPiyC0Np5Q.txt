The wife and I were staying on the strip and wanted to get away from the tourists and eat at a more local friendly spot. Thanks yelpers, this place was a pleasant gem. Enrique was great with the service, food was quick and hot and kept our glasses full. Great personality as well. Paco the executive chef came out and personally delivered the free flan yelpers get for checking in. Wish I lived closer so we could visit more often.
