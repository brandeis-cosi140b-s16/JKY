Searched "Mexican" on yelp a few days ago and up pops this 4.5 star place with nearly 400 reviews and in the words of that south park old lady bus driver: "What! What! what! what?"

...so a buddy and I headed down for the all you can eat taco Thursday for $19.99. We were able to try all 6 before going back for seconds and thirds. Each was unique...the Al pastor and the carne asada were my two favorites but even the vegetarian taco was pretty remarkable. 

Chips and salsa were the best I've had in town and they give you a trio of excellent salsa...not the typical "red sauce and bean dip" a few places in town try to throw at you.

The caramel flan here is crazy good...rich and ultra thick. Check in on yelp and you get a deal for a free one. Score.

Monday is industry night...50% off the entire menu...can't think of a better place to be on MNF.

Tip: Make a reservation before just showing up so you can sit in the main part of the restaurant and not in the back area/bar which I'll know to do next time.
