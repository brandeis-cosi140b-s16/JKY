Fast greets both at the door and the table.  Our server Marion was quick and knowledgeable, which helped us because we were starving and wanted everything on the menu.  The coffee braised beef and the spicy pork tacos were our faves!  And the street corn...AMAZING.  Can't wait to go try more tacos!  Loved it.
