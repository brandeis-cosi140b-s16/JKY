Wow! The food was fabulous and the restaurant was clean and well decorated. Overall, great ambiance. ( we loved the music and art) This is no dive spot.  It's the real deal at a great price.  We will definitely be going back and taking out of town guests for some authentic Mexican food, Phoenix style.
