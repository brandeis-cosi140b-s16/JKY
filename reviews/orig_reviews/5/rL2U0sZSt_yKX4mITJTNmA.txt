Our first time there- Delicious food! It was busy, around 6pm on a Saturday. We were seated immediately and the service was great. Quick and friendly service with a smile. 

I ordered the chicken burrito which was smothered in cheese. My boyfriend ordered the nachos which were huge- enough for 2 or 3 people to share.  The large house margarita was a steal at $7.50, delicious Margarita. He loved the salsa but I didn't eat it. 

Only down side is that it was super hot- not sure if the a/c was broken but the thermostat on the wall said 81. I would've stayed for another drink but left after eating because it was so hot in there.
