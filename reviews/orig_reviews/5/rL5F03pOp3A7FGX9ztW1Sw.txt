1st time there...had to meet friends from San Diego and Hawaii that were staying close....picked this place, a little nervous due to never being there....my friends and I LOVED IT!  From the minute I walked in, customer service was MOST EXCELLENT!  Thank you Chelsea S. for being SO WONDERFUL!  I was also visited by a Manager, Alex....Again, very nice and really wanted to make sure our needs were being met.  She was also WONDERFUL!  The place was packed but we got a great spot by the bar.  I love how the patio is slightly enclosed.  Once the sun went down, this was opened.  With the combination of that and the misters, it made for a trendy cool visiting area!  Now for the food....my friends could not get over how great it was, they are foodies from great ocean areas and really loved the combo and different approach with some of the items they ordered.  I got the kimchi fried rice and I am trying to figure out when I can get back to get some more.....YUMMY!  Drinks were great, I would recommend the grapefruit beer.  So refreshing.  Atmosphere - very up to the minute, warm and welcoming.  Love the colors and the zen style and feel.  My new hang out!  Thank GOD I live close!  THANK YOU FOR A WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE!
