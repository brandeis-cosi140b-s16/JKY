Of course as an original New Mexican, I'm always on the lookout for a yellow flag, zia sign, green chile with a happy face, something that will indicate a NM restaurant...so I'm driving north on Lindsay near Pecos and I see a sign with New Mexican food options.  I stopped in for lunch, had the chile relleno and it was absolutely delicious!  So good, I had to take my family for dinner.  We had the cheese enchiladas (X-Mas style with an egg on top,  if you're from NM you will understand) my kids had smothered burritos and chorizo plate, all great reviews from family.  At my lunchtime visit, I was disappointed they didn't have sopaipillas on the menu, but they do have fry bread with powdered sugar which cured the fix at dinner.  Very happy I found this small joint;  very unassuming, very easy to miss.  But definitely stop in for your chile cravings!
