This place is amazing! It was my first time here because I am on a job out here with my Vegas firms team and if its your first time, they personally bring you a bowl of all three meats for you to try. Their pulehu steak was my favorite! This place is like a Hawaiian chipotle.  They even have thwir own made salsas and sauces. Brilliant. I enjoyed it with my favorite-hawaiian sun :)
