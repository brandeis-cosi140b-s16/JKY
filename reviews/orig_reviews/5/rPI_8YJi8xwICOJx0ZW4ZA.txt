Hands down one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix! The Carne Adovada is the current contender for best dish on 16th St. The atmosphere, food and wine selection will have me coming back again and again. Great date spot, just noisy enough to not hear your date chewing but quiet enough to enjoy good conversation.
