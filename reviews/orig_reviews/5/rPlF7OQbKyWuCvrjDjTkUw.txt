I have actually been to this place over 9 times this year. I actually FOUND it on YELP! Why I haven't done a review?? Idk This place...LLLOOOORRRRDDD this PLACE! I am not a fan of change so FUSION to me is like...DEATH! When I walked into this small quaint place I just assumed that I would have a taco or two and keep going along with my day. WRONG..WRONG..WRONG. My 1st visit I just got every taco they had. PORK,BEEF, CHICKEN, SHRIMP, FISH...they all were great!My favorite however was the beef and pork..The food is always FRESH AND and hot! Not to mention how quickly it comes out.Then the BONUS of the chips, salsa AND GUACAMOLE while you wait?? Whose heard of FREE GUACAMOLE??? I have taken everyone I know to this place, locals and family and friends from California. ALL of them...ALL have loved this place! My friend got their nachos and literally ate until her stomach hurt! It's unbelievable how cheap this place is too! I never spend over $10. LOVE THIS PLACE!!
