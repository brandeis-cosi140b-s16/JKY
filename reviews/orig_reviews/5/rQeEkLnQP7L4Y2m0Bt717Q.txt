Food is great! Incredible beer selection!! I'll b back for happy hour cause who doesn't love an amazing deal?! The staff was impeccable considering our table was pretty outa control. I felt bad for everyone else but than again, that's Vegas? Outside seating is a plus. Thank you to the staff for putting up with our nonsense.
