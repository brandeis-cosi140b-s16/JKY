Excellent all the way around. Carne Adovada (both Green and Red Chile) was outstanding. Pinto beans and rice were just like I had growing up in S New Mexico. Prices were very reasonable for the quality and quantity. Tacked on a signature salad for 2.95. You gotta try it out, you'll love it! I might eat there again tomorrow night.
