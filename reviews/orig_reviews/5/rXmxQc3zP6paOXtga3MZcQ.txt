I've been a big fan of Gallo Blanco. But now Otro is closer, hence I expect to be spending a lot more time here.

First up: the Guacamole- an Otro/Gallo Blanco specialty. While I am partial to Gallo Blanco with the citrus infused guac, this one was pretty tasty.

I'm a huge fan of the chicken soup! Chicken soup you ask? Yes! It comes in a bowl of noodles and broth accompanied by a great selection of fresh herbs (Mint, cilantro) and veggies (beans, jalapenos) to spice your dish to your liking. All for $5? Its a steal!

Tacos: I am a huge fan of Gallo Blanco's tacos. My one complaint, is that there aren't enough on this menu. I know.... I know... They wanted to do something MORE than what they could do at Gallo Blanco. But I just love the GB tacos.

Paella- I've been eyeing it. Will be trying in short order!
