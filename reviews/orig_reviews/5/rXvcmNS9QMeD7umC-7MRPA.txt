So so damn good!!! I am a freak who doesn't normally like asada but damn their asada is the bomb! We also had the table side guacamole=amazing! The service was also superior from the bar tender to the manager, they really do treat you right here. Sure it's adjacent to a strip club but, this place is so good that that doesn't even matter! Well done El Dorado Cantina. We will definitely be coming back to this spot whenever we are in Vegas again!
