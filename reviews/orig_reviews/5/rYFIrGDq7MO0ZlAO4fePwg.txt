We love Ricardo's. I have lived in Las Vegas for 10 years and I try to get in there once a month. My favorite dish is the chicken enchilada. I love their salsa and the large margarita, perfect dinner combination. We were there a few years back when they did the worlds largest margarita for the Guinness record. If my memory serves me correctly, they were pink margaritas in honor of breast cancer awareness month. The booths in the bar have tv's in them if you wanna catch a game while having dinner. The lunch buffet is fantastic too!
