Not as good as it gets in Madison, as Jeff says, but as good as it gets anywhere.  I am a long time fan of Rck Bailess and his Frontera Grill in Chicago.  He has many imitators.  This little storefront place is every bit as good at 1/2 the price and none of the attitude.  I've been to many, many excellent Mexican restaurants all over the country and this is the only one I've found where I could say that.  I often eat vegetarain and they have some great selections to choose from.  Try the vegetarian enchiladas.  Or if you're not a vegetarian-the lamb chops, the chicken in pineapple (I forget what they call in); the shrimp cocktail or the carnitas.  Excellent margaritas.
