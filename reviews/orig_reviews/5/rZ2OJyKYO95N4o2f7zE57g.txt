The green chile burrito is just simply incredible it has the perfect heat and quality green chile goodness that anyone is searching for in any kind of Mexican cuisine
 Next the tacos are by far one the hidden gems that I discovered in this awesome reatraunt, the shredded beef  is just full of flavor and the salsa that comes with it is just as incredible! 
   And today I discovered a new but very simple burrito which I by all respects think is Truly underrated is the bean and cheese burrito but deep-fried it reminded me of what mama used to make me when i was a kid!!!
  Lastly let me point out something: to the douche bag who gave this awesome little Mexican joint a 1 star your an idiot, you don't know shit about Mexican food, the green chile burrito is amazing and the chile inside is robust and full of flavor, and to complain that all of gravy from the burrito burst out of the burrito is just plain stupid, and then to go on to say that no Mexicans go there, well dumbass I'm Mexican and I show up there all the damn time and so does my other Mexican friends and they may not have a stupid fountain machine but what they got is passion and heart for really truly authentic Mexican cuisine
