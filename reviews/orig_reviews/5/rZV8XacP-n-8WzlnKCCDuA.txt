Vegetarian Review:

Potato Rajas Tacos are amazing!  Just amazing! Good portion! Beans and rice are vegetarian. Service was awesome! They even realized I might like something spicy from my reaction to their suggestions and brought out the diablo salsa! 

Didn't care for the chipotle salsa, kinda ketchupy sweet. But everything else was great. 

I will go back to this place even if I have to walk the whole strip.
