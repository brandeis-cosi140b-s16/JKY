Seriously I'm not just talking out of my ass when I announce:

BEST Grilled Chicken and Carne Asada EVER!!!

They only serve grilled (beyond marinated) chicken on the bone and carne asada.  Both of which you may order 1/4, 1/2 or the combo with BOTH (all come with corn or flour tortillas)!  Which explains why such greatness that is 5 stars is involved in the concentration on 2 main items.

Now on to the main points:

-Meal will set you back only $4 to $6 bones per person, cash only

-Chicken may be ordered white or dark and is the most flavorful and crispy grilled, ignore the red-dyed skin, it will be the best grilled chicken you have ever had

-Carne Asada is always cooked to perfection, not overcooked or stringy or chewy, always is Carne Asada greatness

-Not only do meals come with your choice of flour or corn tortillas, they come with perfectly salted pinto beans (not refried), fresh salsa, and red onions that seems to have been soaked (not pickled) reducing their flavor to a delicious subtle onion instead of a crunchy onion.

-Salsa is a tomatoey, pureed (not over pureed), juicy salsa that screams freshness with every bite.

-Lastly, the BLISS OF THE FOODGASM experienced when the tortilla/chicken or beef or both chicken and beef mmm/onions/salsa/and sourcream for those that enjoy a lil sin, explode in your mouth with flavors you only dreamed of...is the reason you must GO HERE ASAP
