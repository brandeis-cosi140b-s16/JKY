Let me start by saying this is my favorite restaurant in Texas. I've been to the original in Austin and multiple locations in Houston. I've been lobbying for a Charlotte location for years. With all that said...

I've been to this location several times now...so this review is an average.

Food: I'll admit that as many times I've been to Chuy's, I almost always get the Chuy's Special. It's under $10 and is enough food to fill almost anyone up. It's a chicken enchilada, and it's delicious. I've also tried the Chicka-Chicka Boom-Boom and the Steak Burrito. Both are very good. I've also been with people who have ordered the Fish Tacos and Fajitas (they said both were good). Be sure to ask for the Creamy Jalapeno Dip if they don't bring it automatically (you used to have to ask). It's great with the in-restaurant made tortilla chips.

Service: I've always had very good service. Very attentive staff and they are happy to recommend choices or help modify dishes (eg: the Steak Burrito comes with hatch green chili sauce which is warm...they can suggest other sauces or simply put the hatch on the side).

Atmosphere: The restaurant itself is decorated with a lot of crazy stuff. Each location comes with an Elvis Shrine and Fish hung from the ceiling (I've heard the fish were a gift at the first location and the owners considered them good luck, so they always have them at new locations).

Price: The basic menu has many, many choices for under $10. I honestly have no idea about bar prices, but the food is very reasonable.

Bottom line...I regularly drive to Chuy's from the Lake for dinner. I love it.
