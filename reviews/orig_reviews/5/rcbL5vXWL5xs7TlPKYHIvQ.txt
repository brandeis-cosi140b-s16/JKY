Usually a little greasy, the metal tin I can hear calling me from the fridge in the middle of the night. Refried black beans, Jade Chicken, and Quesadilla waiting to comfort my tasty buds.

They let you taste whatever entree, Chinese or Mexican, you would like prior to order. These combos are 2 meals for me usually.

I'm not a fan of fusion, fatty food, or fried/refried anything. But if you are going to do it, dear God do it here. Everything I have tasted has been worth it!
