This place is perfect. Great food, atmosphere, service, prices, portions. You get amazing salsa and homemade chips free at the beginning of your meal. My friend and I both got fajitas, and we are speechless. Great mix of creative flavor, and really enough to feed two people or take home the other half for later. I would come here all the time if I lived here; I want to try everything.
