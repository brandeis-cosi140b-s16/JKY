Some of the best food ever served in an airport.  The enchiladas, which are tightly rolled in crusty tortillas and are consequently more like flautas, are outstandingly creative and delicious.  The rest of the fairly small menu is also up to snuff.

The only catch is, the service, especially the taking of orders and, even more, the bringing of the check, are on the leisurely scale of a sitdown city restaurant, not of an airport.  If you have less than about 100 minutes till your flight, then FORGET IT.  Don't eat here: you'll expire of a heart attack while fretting over whether the bill will come before your plane starts boarding.

But the food is good enough to make it worth arranging a long layover, or coming here from another pod in the same terminal, at least.
