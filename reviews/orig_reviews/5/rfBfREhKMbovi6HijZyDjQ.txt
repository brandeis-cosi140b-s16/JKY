This is one of my favorite restaurants in Tempe.  The deciding factors: the food and the atmosphere. The food is Contemporary Mexican/Mexican Fusion. At least that is the best way I can come up with to describe it. But perhaps an example would do better: their guacamole appetizer is surrounded by Gran Marnier. It is unique and amazing. As for atmosphere, they have a nice patio that is walled off from the street and parking lot and decorated with fun strings of lights.  Inside, it has a cool lounge-y feel with contemporary Mexican artwork.  The service is very nice and friendly; our favorite waiter is a self-defined music nerd who was really sweet and enthusiastic.
