Awesome place, fresh chips accompanied with salsa verde, a deep dark roasted salsa and yes warm bean dip, yum! Had the chile verde, rice and beans, one of the best chile verde dishes I've ever eaten. My bro asked our server Cecilia if the had vegetarian and she tells us they can do anything vegetarian his meal was awesome too, cheese enchiladas, black beans and rice. She was awesome too!!
