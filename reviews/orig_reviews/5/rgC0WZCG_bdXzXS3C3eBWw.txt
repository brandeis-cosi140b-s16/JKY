I usually don't like New Mexican food...but this spot is the exception.

Double-down on the warm, green chile salsa.  Put it on everything...you won't be sorry.

Chips/salsa are quite a bit more addicting than most places.  I usually get one of the combo platters as it has a bit of everything and all of them are excellent.  Finish up with a sopapilla (sugar preferred) and you just slammed a perfect meal.
