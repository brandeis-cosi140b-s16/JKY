I ate here with my family and it was a great experience. We were immediately greeted and seated so it wasn't too busy on a Sunday afternoon. Their service was AMAZING. Our waitress was super nice and our chips, salsa, and water kept getting refilled when needed. It took a while for our main entrees but it was worth it. I ordered flautas with beans and rice. The flautas were crispy but soft at the same time. It had a nice balance to it. The rice and beans weren't too bad as well! I was soo full but it was from eating too much of those chips!! lol Overall my fam and I enjoyed the meal, service, and ambiance of this restaurant. I would definitely come back again and hello...there's live music too!! :)
