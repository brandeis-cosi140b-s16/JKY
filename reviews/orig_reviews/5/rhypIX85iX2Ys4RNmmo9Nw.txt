After living in Las Vegas for more than 10 years, I'm disappointed in myself for not knowing about this place sooner.
We decided to drop in for lunch and it wasn't long before the Chef stopped by to introduce himself and see if we had any questions on the menu.
Everything we tried was delicious and came in good sized portions.
They also offer a good tequila list with some flight options.
