I really like this place. I am not from Mexico, so it may not be authentic at all. But hey, it works for me!! The margaritas are great. My husband got me one of those big senorita cups & now we can get those lip smacking margaritas for $3! Can't complain :)

The chips & salsa are great too. Always helps when you are super hungry & want something for a quick fix before the dinner arrives.
