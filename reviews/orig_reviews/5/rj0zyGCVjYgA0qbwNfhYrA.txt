My girlfriend and I decided Nacho Daddy was our Dinner destination for the day and I can only say great things about the place. We walked in and it just so happened to be our waiter was the person that greeted us at the door. He was great! He saw that we were new to the restaurant and gave us great recommendations, the food was delicious and was great quality. Plenty of left overs. Dean was our waiter and he definitely deserves the recognition. He was extremely friendly, supervisor should be proud of the environment that they have developed for their restaurant. All around great experience!
