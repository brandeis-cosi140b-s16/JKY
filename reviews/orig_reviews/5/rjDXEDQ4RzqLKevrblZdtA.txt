Arguably our best meal in Vegas, certainly the most authentic. Value for food .. Tacos El Gordo takes it again. We ate some 5 star meals at some expensive casino restaurants. But all week my wife and I talked about how great their $2 tacos were. I goto Vegas fairly often, and this will now be a must visit for me each time.
