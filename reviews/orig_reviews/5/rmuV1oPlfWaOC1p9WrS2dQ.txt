My favorite taco place in Charlotte. Love the margaritas and the appetizer roll with the crab meat (can't remember the name). BBQ mahi, ahi tuna, and the serrano chicken are some of my go-to tacos. If it's in season get the jalapeno mashed potatos (can they please start having this year-round!?!?). Usually a bit of a wait but it is well worth it!
