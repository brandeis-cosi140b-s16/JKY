Topline: Go for Brunch if you like (hence the name) border style Mexican breakfast foods.  You won't be disappointed, and due to the way it's served, you can get all you can eat without worrying about the previous guess sneezing on your eggs.

Would have never tried it due to location, but got a comp to eat at Border Grill Brunch in Mandalay. It's not a "buffet" brunch, but a tapas all you can eat for $29.99 and you can add all you can drink Mimosas for $5 (of various flavors), where they bring you tiny little plates of some of the tastiest Baja/Northern Mexican breakfast food I've ever had. Not to be missed were the Chilaquiles, the Plantain Empanada, and the Short Rib Hash and Egg. I live in Seattle, but miss the food I used to get at hole in the wall places readily in San Diego and Los Angeles. This comes mighty close, and the outdoor patio overlooks the pool area which can make for some...amusing...people watching.

WARNING: This is Cali/Zona border.  This is not Tex Mex.  I read so many reviews saying things like "Lack of BBQ" or "Not really Mexican".  Mexico has regional cuisine, just like the US or any other land mass.  Just because it's not what "YOU" consider to be border food or Mexcian food, doesn't mean it isn't... Baja is not the same as Gulf.  Yucutan is not the same as Oaxacan.  This is more of the NorthWestern/Baja Mexican.  Go in knowing that, and you'll be fine!

I may have stumbled upon it due to a comp as a first timer, but from here on out, it'll be the one "lock" on all my future Vegas trips.
