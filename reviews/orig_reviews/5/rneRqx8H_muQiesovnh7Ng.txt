We were looking for a place to eat prior to a show at the Smith Center. We called at 5 to get reservations for 5:30 and were pleasantly surprised when they had room for us. Loved the decor, and the staff was extremely attentive and polite. Our party of 4 shared 2 appetizers--chicken taquitos and a steak quesadilla. Both were fantastic.  I ordered the pork tenderloin with mango salsa and my husband had the wagyu steak; we shared the Mexican street style corn. It was all delicious, cooked perfectly, and nicely presented. I look forward to eating at Mundo's again.
