Delicious every time I come!  I love everything from the freshly made chips and salsa or guacamole to the tacos and even the salads are amazing.  The prices also can't be beat.  Tacos are only $2 on Tuesdays, and if you sign up for their weekly texts there are additional offers (this week is two for one salads).

The service is also pretty friendly and accommodating.  I called ahead on a previous visit so we wouldn't have to wait for a table on a Saturday evening for dinner.  When we arrived the hostess had gone above and beyond to secure a table away from the noisy bar area with room for a stroller for us since my sister was bringing her infant daughter.  I do wish they had high chairs but we managed.  The server also had our bill to us at 6:30 on the dot, cards already run, as we requested so we would be on time to Gammage for our show.

We definitely will continue to come back.  We've also been to the one in Old Town, but the Mill Ave location is more convenient for us and is a great weekday lunch spot.

Oh, and in response to another reviewer with a chip on his shoulder I'm NOT an employee, just someone who loves a good deal that will stretch my dining out dollars (if you check my Linked In profile you'll see I work in insurance a few miles away).
