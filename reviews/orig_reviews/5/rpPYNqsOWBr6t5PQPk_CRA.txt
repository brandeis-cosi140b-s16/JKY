Stopped here for dinner twice on our 3 night stay at The Hard Rock.  I got the pink taco plate both times, that is how much I liked it the first time.  Perfect, delicious little tacos.  The rice and beans were also very good.  Most times they just taste like canned beans, and old dry, or overcooked rice.  Both of these were perfect.
