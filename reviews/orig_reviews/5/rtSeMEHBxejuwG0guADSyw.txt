Fantastic service, delicious food, and perfect margaritas! What more could you ask for? Oh, maybe an extensive menu of tequila and cocktails, including tequila on tap? Yep well, they have that too! We have been back in AZ for 2 days after living in HI for 3 years, and of course have been eating nothing but all the Mexican food we can get our hands on! We were headed to our go-to place, Serrano's...and I am so glad they are closed on Sundays because that forced us to drive a little farther north and find this gem! Had the tres amigos for an appetizer and it went perfectly with our "margarita flights", the three margarita sampler where you choose three of their many fruity flavors (the three together were enough to get me a bit buzzed and my mom just barely drunk). We also got the grilled fish tacos and steak enchiladas, and both were amazing. The fajitas that passed by our table were mouth-watering, even though we were already SO full! Ryan was our waiter and was super attentive and friendly! He mentioned they have been open almost a year and miiiiiiiiight be having a huge party when they hit the year mark...well we will DEFINITELY be there! As this particular building location has a terrible track record of businesses failing, I am praying that TQLA makes it and is open for many years to come!
