Being from the east coast I was hoping to get some really good authentic Mexican food. I'm not sure I found that here,  but what I did find was fabulous. Great retro styling and a lively atmosphere make for a comfortable setting. I had time on both of my visits to try a couple different  Aguas Frescas my favorite was pineapple with tequila.  Highlights were, the pork taco and tortilla soup. Both were amazing!  The cucumber salad gets an honorable mention as well. The could have been a little better, was the Baja fish taco. It was a bit boring in taste. If I'm ever back in Phoenix I will be stopping back for a great time.
