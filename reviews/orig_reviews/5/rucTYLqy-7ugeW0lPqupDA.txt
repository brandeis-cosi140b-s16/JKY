Escobar's is my favorite restaurant in Champaign.  I have eaten there on 4 or 5 occasions, and I have not been disappointed.  My boyfriend and I have ordered everything from their fish, steak, appetizers, and salads - and we are always impressed with the food.  I would recommend it to anybody in Champaign!
