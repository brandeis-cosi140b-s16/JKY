Great food, good variety. The hummus with ground beef was amazing. Came here with a couple of friends and enjoyed some delicious hookah. Next time I come near Vegas I'm definitely coming back here. I personally had the stroganoff which was amazing, the asada fries were also great. Oh and ask to try the Kompot drink, it is very refreshing and just the right amount of sweet.
