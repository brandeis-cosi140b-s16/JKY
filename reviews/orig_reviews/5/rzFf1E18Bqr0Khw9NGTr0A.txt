Best tacos in Las Vegas!

Other than being in actual Mexico and eating tacos, this is the next best thing! The meats are flavorful and tender! Salsas are great.

Carne Asada fries are bomb!

My favorite is adobada, cabeza and lengua tacos! 

Ordering is easy. You line up by what kind of meat you want. Once in any line you can ask for any other meats you want as well and they will shoutout your order to the guy working that particular meat! 

Also, They have quesadillas too! And free grilled onion and or peppers ! 

Overall great place to have tacos !
