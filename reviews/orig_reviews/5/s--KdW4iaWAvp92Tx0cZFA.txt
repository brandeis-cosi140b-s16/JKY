Fantastic food at a FANTASTIC price!!  I got Jim's Bulgogi Fried Rice and still have half the plate left over when I was through.  I have a whole meal left in the refrigerator and for the price, you can't beat it!  I will definitely be back to try more of the Fusion items.  Thanks Yelp!  Great 1st find for me!!  :-)
