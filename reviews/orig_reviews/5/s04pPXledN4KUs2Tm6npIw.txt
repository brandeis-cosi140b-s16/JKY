This place has the best authentic Mexican food I've ever had. They have cactus as part of the meals. Prices are very reasonable and the presentation of the food is excellent. Service was quick and the servers are very friendly. I would definitely eat here again. The puerco ahumado is a good choice for anyone who wants to have cactus and a filling pork dish. Can't say enough good things about la comida it's one of the best restaurants in vegas!
