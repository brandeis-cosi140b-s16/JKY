Made day of reservations when i couldn't get into MESA GRILL and I'm sort of glad I couldn't. 
I have to admit i had my reservations about coming here at first as i had been burned by other 'Mexican' places out here in vegas. Coming from Los Angeles, i guess I'm a bit of a snob about my Mexican food. But this place did not disappoint, in fact, i was impressed.
First off, hostess and waitress were super friendly, decor is not typical, its very modern. Salsa that comes with the complimentary chips is homemade and a hair spicy, just the way i like it. Menu extensive, which i give bonus points for over MESA GRILL, which has a very limited menu.
I ordered one of the combination plates that comes with an enchilada (chorizo), crispy taco (beef) and chile relleno. I usually hate chile rellenos but have been converted due to Javiers. One thing I've never seen or had is that serve refried white beans. WOW! They're much smoother in taste and texture than pinto or black beans. Super good.
I also ordered a tamarindo (tamarind) margarita. Im a light drinker so if i taste ANY alcohol in my drink, i hate it. This is the smoothest hard drink I've ever had. 
I can go on and on about this place. I want to go try their  seafood now. Hope you guys go try this place out and have as great an experience as i did. 
More places in Vegas should be as authentic in taste as this place.
