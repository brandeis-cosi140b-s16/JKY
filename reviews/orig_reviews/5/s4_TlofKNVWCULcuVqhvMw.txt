The food here is extremely fresh and made with high quality ingredients. I ordered the tacos de pollo and a pomegranate margarita. Both of which I would highly recommend. Even the next day the tacos were amazing. The evening atmosphere is very calm and dark. My only complaint was that we were seated by a family who was very loud and it was hard to hear others at my table talking.
