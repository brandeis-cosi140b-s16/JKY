A perfect place to visit when you you're torn between a Asian and Mexican food craving! This place is not only beautiful and modern on the inside, but the food is delicious! Sushi is fresh with perfect flavors, loved the fish tacos, and the pomegranate guacamole is a must try! The staff is also very kind, patient, and awesome at helping you order. Will definitely come back when I'm in AZ!
