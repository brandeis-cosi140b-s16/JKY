I am a huge Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives fan from the Food network channel which brings me to this place. I've never tried a fish taco until I came here and fell in love! I've tried almost ever taco combination on the menu and its like my 1st time, everythime. Great atmosphere, local art, local beer, and great vibes. I have yet to find a better fish taco anywhere else. Noda Charlotte, NC
