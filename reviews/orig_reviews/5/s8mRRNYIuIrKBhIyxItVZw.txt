I've wanted to try this place for a long time.  I've driven by a number of times but never was able to talk anyone into going with me.  We were out spending a day doing shopping in Scottsdale and drove by on the way home.  I mentioned it to my wife and she agreed to try it.  As we walked in we both exclaimed that this was a really cool little place.  The interior is like a cave and there is running water everywhere which I love.

Our waitress promptly sat us and took our drink order.  Our drinks came back very quickly which was perfect.  We ordered some chips/salsa for an appetizer and a couple of the chicken salads.  The chips and salsa arrived quickly and our drinks were refilled.  The salsa was awesome and the chips had a spice on them.  Most of the items in the restaurant are a little on the spicy side so if you don't like spice your menu selection may be limited.  They may be able to make something less spicy for you too but we didn't ask.  Our drinks were refilled two more times before the salads arrived.  The salads were excellent.  They were huge and had a wonderful flavor.  The chicken in both was very tender with a crisp outside.  

Our drinks never went empty and our waitress was incredibly nice.  This was the best service I've had at a restaurant in a long time!  I wish all service was like this.  We ate half of our salads and took the rest along with the remainder of the chips to go.  The waitress talked with us as she boxed up the rest of our meals which was a nice touch.  I even tipped over 20% because I was so impressed by the service.  As we were heading out we were thanked for dining there by a lady at a table (perhaps an owner or manager) which was also nice.

The awesome food, incredibly friendly staff, and decoration of this place will keep us coming back.  I'm glad I finally tried this place and look forward to many more visits!
