Had been wanting to hit this place up for the longest time since it was on Man v Food. Got there early on a Friday night and sat right down. Ordered the Torta Del Rey. Upon arrival of this beast landing in front of me i downed a tasty coca cola from the recycled bottle. My g/f ordered the torta norteno and pinapple water. the water was very good and tricked me into getting the watermelon water once that was gone. Both flavored waters very falvorful but could be server colder. 

On to the tortas....The del ray was exactly what i wanted. So big i couldnt even get a solid bite out of it. All the different elements coming together to form a magical flavor party in every bite. The red and green salsas were very good too and added some spice and kick to the torta. The norteno was a simpler and less beast like torta but was very good as well and would get it next time if im not forced by hunger to order the del rey again.

Overall this place is a hidden treasure in sunnyslope and will now be on my list of go to places
