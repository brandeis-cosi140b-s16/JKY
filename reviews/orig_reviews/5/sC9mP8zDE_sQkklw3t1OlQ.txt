This spot is a favorite amongst valley poker players, as the owner Jose happens to be a fellow enthusiast.

I finally got to try it out on the recommendation of other regulars at the card table and I can tell you without a doubt this deceptively small and unassuming diner has the best chicken you're likely to eat in all the East Valley. Give them a try, I've heard comparisons to El Pollo Loco, and that is frankly an insult to this, the true mom n' pop chicken diner.

Inexpensive, well plated, well priced and you won't leave hungry. These guys are well worth a visit!
