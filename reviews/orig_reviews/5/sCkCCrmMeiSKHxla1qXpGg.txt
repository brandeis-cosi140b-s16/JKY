doesn't get any better than this.  went on a saturday night and surprisingly there wasn't a wait.  we were seated right away.  the chips, salsa and beans were the best ever!  funny how 3 small bowls can make me happy.  i ordered 2 tacos, carne asada and carnitas with a side of rice and beans.  this also came with soap was so good and just like my mom makes.  the service was great even when we kept eating up the chips, salsa and beans.  i've been there about 3 times and look forward to it.
