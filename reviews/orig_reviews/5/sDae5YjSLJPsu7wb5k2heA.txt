GAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH The vegan nachos were SO good!!!! My BF didn't like the jerk tofu street tacos but I loved them. The portions were huuuuuge. I didn't realize it was sort of like a chain? Kind of reminds me of a Chili's inside but once you get past the tacky decor and bad playlist, the food is worth it.
