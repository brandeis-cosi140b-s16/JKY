Pedro's was recommended to us by a friend.  I have been a few times and I am just wowed.  You walk in and you think you have entered the 70's, but it works at this place. It adds to the charm.  The staff are very friendly and kind.  The food is absolutely amazing.  I have had the chicken tacos, an enchilada, and a releno.  They have all been good-this is not your typical phoenix mexican food.
