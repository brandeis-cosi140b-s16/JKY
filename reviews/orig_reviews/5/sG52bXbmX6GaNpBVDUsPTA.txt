The menu is really good.  There are so many combos.  I had no idea that the place is so big.  (I was never in the other locations.)  The bar looked great, they seem to have a lot of drinks.  Tamales are very good.  They are served differently than I am used to.  The outdoor seating looks nice.  And the service is good and timely.
Okay so I came back!  Food was excellent again.  If you are there during the day Luis the bartender/waiter is very attentive without being overbearing.  The busboys were also very nice also.  I do recommend Viva Mercado.
