AMAAAZING!

I'm from California so the Mexican food I am used to has me picky and particular. After moving here for 4 years now I have had many-many-many disappointments.

Although this food is a more of a New Mexican feel, it was absolutely delicious and rustic with a bit of fusion going on. We went for breakfast this past Sunday and I was automatically charmed by the exterior; the inside was just as if not even more charming, service was great and the food was delicioso! 

I had a Pork Tamale with a fried egg(which I order a la cart), for breakfast; there is no other way to eat a tamale, all I needed was some champagne! I also order a cup of the pozole. I had a moment where I wished my cup was magical like Mary Poppins bag and that the soup would never stop, but hence it did.

My family loved there food we will very much be going back!
