Completely obsessed with this place! It's my favorite! The flour tortilla chips are amazing! The drinks are strong which is a blessing with how much drinks cost these days and they even made me something personal that was not on the menu! The staff is so sweet and friendly! It's a hidden gem with a great atmosphere and not everyone knows about it so that's a plus!
