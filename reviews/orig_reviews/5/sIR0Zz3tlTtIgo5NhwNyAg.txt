This is a NEW MEXICAN restaurant and you can expect to actually get HOT red/green chili that rivals the best restaurants NM has to offer (and it's reasonably priced).  

Having lived in NM for 20 years, I'm extremely spoiled and want my Mexican food with the spice that you can only get from the NM grown Anaheim Green Chili's and Si Senor's has that in spades.  

It's very casual so you can feel comfortable sitting down to a meal after a hard day's work and the staff is always courteous & quick.  As soon as you sit down, you are munching on chips with 4 incredible salsa/dip choices.  It's always a little busy, but after eating there dozens of times I can only remember the service being a bit slow once (found out they were short staffed that night, so it was understandable).

My favorites -  the chile relleno & the hatch valley chile con carne ("Christmas Style" of course, with both red & green chile & an egg on top).  YUM!! 

My only warning - try not to over eat!  Just get the left over box and have some more another day as the free sopapillas for dessert are too good to pass up!
