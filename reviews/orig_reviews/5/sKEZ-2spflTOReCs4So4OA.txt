This place is simple AMAZING. Best tacos in phoenix especially their fish taco. They know everyone by name. Plus, their prices are the best in town. 3 tacos for $6, you can't beat that. I frequently go to this place probably once every 1-2 weeks. I love how casual and quick it is. Don't keep passing by this place.
