Purpose if visit. Late lunch after going out Friday night. Ordered the Los diablos al pastor burrito. Marinated pork with jalape√±o peppers, rice, sour cream and guacamole. Burrito was perfect for a hangover. Spicy enough for a nice kick. The homemade chips and salsa was excellent. The homemade hot sauce was also a great addition. Peppery but had a long lasting kick. Ordered a nice horchata drink. Tasted like rice pudding with cinnamon. Very sweet. Perfect inexpensive lunch downtown.
