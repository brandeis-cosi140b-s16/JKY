Very good food! Fast service. Came at lunch (1145). We got our meal within 10 mins of ordering.

My husband and I shared the lunch fajitas! Very delicious ! More than enough fo two people !

We also had the queso fundido!  So so good! Highly recommend! 

I also checked in on yelp and got my free margarita! 

They have free Wi-Fi here as well!

We will be back for sure!
