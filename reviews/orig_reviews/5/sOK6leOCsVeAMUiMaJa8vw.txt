Chino Bandido is everything I could ever ask for in a fusion of two types of cuisine!! The combination of Chinese and Mexican food will blow your mind and is incredibly delicious. After hearing about the amazingness that is Chino Bandido for many years I finally made my way there and was surprised at just how good it really was. The staff was very friendly and made our first experience an enjoyable one. The jade red chicken and emarald chicken were by my favorites but I think anything you order here would be delicious and I intend to try as much as I can in the future!!
