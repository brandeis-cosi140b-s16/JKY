My friend Tom told me to go there. I didn't think it was gonna be as good as he said it would be, but man Im hooked on this place. The flavor in the food is so unique. The menu has such great variety. I had the Chimichanga Monday, Tuesday, I had the Ribs which were very good. Friday, I had the Beef Medallion with Chipotle Pasta, my Dad had the meatloaf. Their food is incredible. Anyone who doesn't give this place at least 4 stars, has no credibility when it comes to food. It is a 5 in my book. Can't wait to go again soon.
