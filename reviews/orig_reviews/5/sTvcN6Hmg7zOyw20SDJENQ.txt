YUMMMM!!!

I cannot wait to return to this wonderful Boutique Mexican Taco Restaurant!!!! The atmosphere was very relaxing & not too loud. The staff was super helpful and pointed us in the right direction while ordering. You can't go wrong here, everything on the menu was delicious! *the guacamole needed a little more seasoning, but was still super fresh* Our drinks never ran dry & there was always someone checking on us. We had such a blast here & plan to return SOON!  :)
