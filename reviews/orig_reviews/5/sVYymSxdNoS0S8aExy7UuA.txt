We dine here at least once a week. The service is always excellent. I love that they have a free rewards card where you can earn points towards free appetizers, desserts, and 50% off your bill. What's nice is you can earn double points Monday-Thursdays 2pm-5pm. They have an awesome lunch special menu. Starting as low as $8.50. Which includes your beverage and of course unlimited chips and salsa. My two favorites dishes are the Chicken taco salad and steak ranchero. They make the tortillas fresh as well. A+ in my books!
