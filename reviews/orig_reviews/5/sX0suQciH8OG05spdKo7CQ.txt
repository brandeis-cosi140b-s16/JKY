Hidden Gem!   So glad we came across this place.  You cannot tell from the outside how unique and cool this place is.  Food was great, atmosphere and decor are spectacular and a great place for kids.   Eat inside or out the view is amazing and service is excellent.  A must try when your in Cave Creek, we often went right bye it, so glad this time we stopped :)
