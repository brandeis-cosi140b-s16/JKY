Tried it and I gotta tell you this was an exceptional outing.  Everything from food to service.
    Place closes at 5 and I popped in 4:10-15ish (some places give you THAT look you know) and place was lil slow as to be expected.  Frank the owner was there and I gotta tell you he goes above and beyond to provide an experience.  We ended up chitchatting some before, during and even after my order.  I left nearly at close time and never got any bad vibes.  He's real cool, real humble and I found out we both made our way to the 702 roughly the same time, out from SoCal.
    All that aside the food was great, got an adobada torta (based on his recommendation) and I gotta tell you the pork was done perfect and their secret sauce put it up there.  Perhaps the best torta I've had to date.  I say this cause I was listening to Pandora a lil while and I went from a whole torta to half a half (you'll know what I'm saying) in a matter of minutes.  I seriously devoured that torta!  I also ended up getting their pork nachos (which I've never had that way) put some of their home made hot salsa and went to town on it too.  In all the torta is a definite 5/5 it was simply awesome... the nachos could've used a lil something something else too but for my taste get 3.5-4/5 not bad.
    Next time I'm trying their fish tacos which he said has the same secret sauce or depending on what time I go might get their breakfast burrito.  I'm jotting this one down as a definite go-back.
