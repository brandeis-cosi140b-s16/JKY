Checked this place out based on the Yelp reviews. We were not disappointed. My wife and I split 2 entrees and an appetizer: camarones a la diabla, aguachile tostado, and the empanadas de camarones.  Each item was amazing. Only downside was they only have a beer and wine license so no margaritas. The quality of the food quickly overcame that.
