Cantina Laredo was quite a surprise. We only chose to eat there, because we were close on time to see a movie across the street at The Suncoast & they took reservations. Walking in, I must have had a look on my face of a person who'd never seen a restaurant... but I was in a bit of awe, because the inside looked nothing like I pictured in my head. We both thought it was going to be small, dark & "weird"... the place is huge, light & airy. Very comfortable. Our waitress was awesome- genuinely pleasant & the perfect level of attentive, especially once we told her we were tight on time. The chips are amazing- very very thin. I'm not certain what the salsa is comprised of- there's a flavor I'm not normally a fan of- but, gosh, I went to town. The bestie got the mushroom enchiladas & I got a chicken with mushrooms & artichokes- portions were perfect, both dishes were refreshing & booming with flavor. Rather than beans & rice, our entrees came with thinly sliced & sauteed zucchini & rice. I devoured the veggies... the simplicity in flavor balanced the robust entree items & made the meal less bulky, like some Mexican food can be. Then we were off to see a movie! Helpful hint: whether eating at Tivoli or Boca Park, consider The Suncoast for seeing movies... no one is ever there! On a Friday/release day, we got right in with maybe 9 other parties in the theater with us. Anyway, give Cantina Laredo a shot- I don't think you'll be disappointed.
