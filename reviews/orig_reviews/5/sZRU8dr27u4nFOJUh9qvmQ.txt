Careful you don't pass this one up! It's easy to drive right by it if the old school/retro sign is not lit up at night, so keep an eye out. It's worth it! 

Let's start with Jose who greets you with a smile. I went there on a Saturday with a large party. Loved it so much, I went back on the following Wednesday. Jose not only remembered me, he remembered what I ordered. 

On to the ambiance - charming with an eye for detail - very nice. The food: spectacular. From the chips and salsa to the appetizers and main courses - all were prepared with the kind of old world love that reminds you what dining should be all about.

If they have it on special, try the hanger steak with three sauces - fantastic!
