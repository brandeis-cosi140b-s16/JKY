Border Grill's Brunch is by far the best brunch I've ever had. It's unlimited tapas style plates. They are made to order. All were amazing but our favorites were Tres leches French toast (this was heaven in my mouth), pigs in a blanket, Peruvian shrimp and grits, yucatan eggs benedict, chile relleno (we ordered 3) and ceviche del dia. The service was amazing, and very thorough in respecting the food allergies of my friend.  Honestly, one of the best brunch experiences of my life.  Strongly hope and wish they open a Border Grill in my hometown (Portland, OR).  I'll be talking about this brunch for a long time to come, and I'm kinda sad it's over.  It was so good we slow clapped for the waitress the food was so good.  Adrienne was our waitress--we're in love with her--amazing service & such a professional.
