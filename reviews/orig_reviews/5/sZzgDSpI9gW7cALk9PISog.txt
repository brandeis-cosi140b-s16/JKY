Rokerij is no Jokerij!

Not much new can be written about this amazing spot, so I will try and be brief. Went to the basement bar for Friday happy hour, and it was love at first sight. Cozy, dark, and welcoming- this is a place you can get lost in.

Grabbed a seat at the bar, and were warmly greeted. Ordered margaritas and some small plates, they were both outstanding. Tried numerous small plates, and each one was delicious and hit the spot.

If you like margaritas, you will be a happy camper. Also try the stuffed mushrooms, they are amazing.

After leaving my new favorite place, we went to the Taste of Scottsdale, and it was surprising that none of the food there was HALF as good as what Rokerij provided. After a few samples, my group gave up, as it wasn't fair to our stomachs to put average food with amazing Rokerij food. All in all, not a bad problem to have.
