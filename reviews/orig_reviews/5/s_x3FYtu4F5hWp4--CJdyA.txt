I've been coming to La Fonda del sol since 1992. When I lived in the Valley a meal there was a minimum once a week.  Since moving away from the area I still come to visit annually and make my first meal at La Fonda. Have had a variety of dishes but nothing beats their enchiladas; red or green, shredded beef tacos and their special chimi with chicken or beef. Their chips are light and crispy and always  served hot and fresh. Their mild salsa rivals no other! A stop here for an authentic meal which will not disappoint... Hasn't me for almost 25 years!
