Love this place!! The banana shake, the standard burger, and the lemonade are my favorites. All the girls that work there are so friendly and always have a smile on their face. The owner is fantastic and tries to connect with her guests. I saw her catching up with a regular when I was there. Plus they just started giving free fries with every burger purchase on Mondays from 11 - 3!!
