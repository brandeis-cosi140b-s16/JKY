Some of the BEST Mexican Food in the Valley and close to work. Reminds me of what I get when I am in San Diego. Been eating here at least twice a week for the last year and it is always tasty. They have take out, drive through, indoor and outdoor seating if you want. Always very clean inside and out. Family owned and run. They take great pride in delivering fantastic fresh favors with large portions for an affordable price. They have several combo plates with rice and beans on the menu or you can just order a la cart which I prefer. Tacos, Burritos, Tortas, Cheese Crisp, Nachos, Fish and Shrimp dishes, Authentic Soups, Soda Pops, and Deserts. Too many items to list them all here. Some of my favorites would be the fish tacos, shrimp tacos, chile rellenos, carnitas, carne asada, fajitas, al pastor, breakfast burritos of all sorts. They are very friendly and will make what ever you want pretty much. Great Salsa Bar also with fresh hot carrots and jalapenos, cucumbers, limes / lemons, and 4 different salsas. Simplemente fant√°stico!
