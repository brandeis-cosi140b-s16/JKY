Just wow. Were from Ohio and wanted to try some local Phoenix Mexican food while we were out, and after searching online we decided on Popos. Like other reviews said, don't be fooled by the exterior of the building, because the inside is like a hidden treasure. Great friendly and welcoming service and the food was to die for. Might not be able to eat Ohio "Mexican" food again after tasting this. Highly recommended
