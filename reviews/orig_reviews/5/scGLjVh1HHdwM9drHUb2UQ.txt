5 stars for living up to the 4.5 star Yelp rating!  This place is close to home so we finally stepped out of our norm and tried it.  Totally satisfied.   I had the carne asada chimichanga.. One word, awesome!    My husband had the carnitas plate, the carnitas was in slices (versus shredded like we are used to) so we were skeptical, but it was so moist & tender and not greasy at all.  We will definitely be back for every Mexican craving we have lol.   Only suggestion would be to add "ba√±os" to the bathroom sign to top off the good Mexican vibes!
