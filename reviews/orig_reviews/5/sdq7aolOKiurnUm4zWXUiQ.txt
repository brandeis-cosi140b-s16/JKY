I went to Abuela's Tacos with my family. The tacos de chicharron verde are the best I have ever tasted and to top it of they have handmade tortillas which even made them better. My husband had the shrimp tacos and said they were very good, but  I knew he really liked them when he asked to go the following weekend for more. I really recommend this Abuela's Tacos to anybody who likes mexican food and even if you don't you will there.
