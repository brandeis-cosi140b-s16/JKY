This place gets better every time we come here! Normally I am a carne asada enthusiast but today I was extremely pleased to enjoy the pollo asada! The flavor is awesome and the jalapenos in the pico have a freshness that you don't get at too many Mexican food restaurants.  The chips and salsa are made in house, the salsa is fantastic!! All the people who work there are very friendly.  They have seasonal fruit beverages that are out of this world!! Made fresh with no added sugar!! YUM!! I love Mango's!
