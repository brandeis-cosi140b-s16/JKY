Chicken Soup for the Soul!  The best chicken tortilla soup in NC-comes with 2 cheese quesadillas for the low low price of $6.95. 

Tons of high quality food for average to low prices. My sons likes the burritos, my husband the soft tacos. 

Serves a big basket of chips and two different types of salsa. You can ask for third kind-green which is very hot but is good. Not included gratis but, delicious is that big dipping bowl of queso.
