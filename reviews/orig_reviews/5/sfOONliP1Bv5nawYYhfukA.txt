OMG!!! We drove past this restaurant many times, very colorful. Reminded me of Little Miss Sunshine. I am a coupon queen and remembered we had a 2 for 1 in my entertainment book. I was really hungry and said "Let's try it, I have a coupon." OMG!!! Who cares about a coupon. You walk in and feel like your their family. If your not sure what you want, you can sample the meats or they will help you decide. This is like a Mexican Subway. You pick ALL your meats, cheeses, vegs., everything that you want in your burrito. And it is a HUGE Tortilla!!! The Carne Asada, Chili Verde and the Chorizo/Egg to die for. Salsa Bar included for free. Try it. If in doubt, use a coupon.
