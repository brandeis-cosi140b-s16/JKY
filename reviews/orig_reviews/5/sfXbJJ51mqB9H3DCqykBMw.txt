Despite getting my order wrong 1 out of every 3 times I come here (srsly, after 3 years of spanish in high school, you'd think I'd have a sub-conscious vocabulary that would show itself in times of need) I continue to come here, trying new stuff sometimes, keeping to the classics others. 

This past weekend I gave the Enchiladas Flor de Calabaza a try, con salsa verde, of course. I was pretty blown away. Tiny triangles of perfectly sauteed zucchini, just the right amount of spice, a little queso fresco inside the enchilada, a little more on top. Sour crema squirt garnish (love it here-- always colder than you'd expect, a little salty, rad). $6. 

I'm really coming to love their enchilada a la carte thing, as you can forgo rice and beans for a more interesting appetizer as a side, if you wish, or just gorge yourself on the top-notch (free) chips and salsa and keep it cheap. I love you, Casa.
