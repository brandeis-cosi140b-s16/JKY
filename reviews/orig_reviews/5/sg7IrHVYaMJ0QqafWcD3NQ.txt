Someone recommended that I try this place and I was more than pleasantly surprised.  We were seated quickly, chips and salsa came, three salsa choices not the typical one salsa.  I had the short rib tamale, and I wasn't sure what to expect, but when my food came (not a very long wait, which is great at lunch time) it was very pleasant to look at, more like a piece of art than lunch.  When I took my first bite...WOW!  Full explosion of flavor, great taste.  This is not your typical Mexican restaurant, to which added to me wanting to try it.  My wife and kids enjoyed their lunch, Our waiter was very quick to refill our glasses each time they got low, not empty.  Thanks to the whole staff for making it a great experience!
