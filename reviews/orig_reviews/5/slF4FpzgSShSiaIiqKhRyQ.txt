Just tried this place out the other day after it was recommended to us. Thought the tacos were wonderful! We tried an array and couldn't finish them all! Also had the chips, salsa, and guac, all of which were extremely tasty. Tried out some margaritas as well that did not disappoint! Had great weather so enjoyed the patio and just had an all around wonderful lunch!
