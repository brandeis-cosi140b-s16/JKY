I absolutley love this place, I have been coming here since it was a small "hole in the wall" on Flamingo Rd. now they are about 22/23 miles away from me but that does not stop me from driving across town to come & indulge in some real authentic mexican food. I am Mexican and I know what real authentic mexican food is suppose to taste like & this place hits home all the time, I have had just about everything on the menu and could not say one bad thing about anything on it, all is delicious and full of flavor.

Service is amazing, love walking into a place w/cheerful and upbeat smiling faces.
