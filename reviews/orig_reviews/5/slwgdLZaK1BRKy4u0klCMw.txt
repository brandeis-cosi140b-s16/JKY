We went here for the first time tonight and it was awesome! We each had the carne asada tacos and split a carne asada quesadilla,  It was all excellent as was the salsa. 
The crowd was a good mix of collage kids, couples and Mexican families. It was a nice if not quiet setting, when it cools down it will be nice to sit on the patio. 
We can't wait to go back.
