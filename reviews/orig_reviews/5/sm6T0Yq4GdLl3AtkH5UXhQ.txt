Came to tacos and beer for happy hour today for the first time. I was pleasantly surprised! I'm always happy to see quite a few vegetarian options on the menu. The veggie taco was delicious! I can't wait to try to jicama salad next time. 
We had 3 tacos, 2 margaritas and 2 Pacificos for 20 bucks! Can't beat that!
