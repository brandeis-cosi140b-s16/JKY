Seriously SO good. My new favorite taco place. I got the carnitas and pulled pork tacos and the corn and it was so tasteful and full of flavor. The server was so friendly and quick to wait on us. I got the house margarita and that was good, but I'm pretty sure they use lime juice not fresh squeezed because it was a little sugary. The corn was to die for delicious and I haven't had corn that good since actually being in Mexico. I'd definitely come here again with some friends for bottomless mimosas and tacos; perfect Saturday or Sunday hangout.
