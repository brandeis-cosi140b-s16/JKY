This is what Mexican restaurants looked like when I had my first meal in one in the 70s.  We came twice for breakfast.  I had the machaca and it was great.  The second time the waiter suggested carnitas machaca which was also great.  Guacamole was delicious, coffee was good, there is a lady there making fresh tortillas in front of you and they made me jalapanos toreados.  Loved the room, ambience and service.  Cheap for vegas.   Fun and highly recommended - at least for breakfast!
