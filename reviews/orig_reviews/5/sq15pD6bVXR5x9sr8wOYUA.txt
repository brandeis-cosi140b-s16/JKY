We just had yet another great dinner here at blanco. We came in late, about an hour before closing. The hostess that seated us seemed to be working double duty and turned out to also be our waitress. Hat tip to her, our service was great, attentive, consistent, and on point. Chips and salsa here is always exceptional, the rice tastes and smells great. We'll continue to enjoy food at this location!
