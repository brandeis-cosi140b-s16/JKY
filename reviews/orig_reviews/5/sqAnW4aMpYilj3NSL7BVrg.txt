This place gives you BIG portions and it will fill you up for the day (if you eat this between lunch and dinner).  I recommend the Pork Barbacoa (it is sweet.... they use Coca Cola in the recipe)  The salads are so wonderful with the creamy tomatillo dressing.  My husband loves the enchilada style chicken burrito.  It may be a little pricier than other burrito joints, but it's healthier and worth it!
