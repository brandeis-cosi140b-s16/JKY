Yum yum! Love the carna asada burrito & tacos! Oh & the carna asada fries too! Customer service is good & there is a nice amount of seating. I usually just call in for a pick up if it is busy which I love (: All of my friends and family I have recommended to this place have never complained. Bomb.com
