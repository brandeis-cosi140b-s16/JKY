Their 3 way chimichangas are to die for. I was talking to a friend about mexican food. I said there is only one mexican food restaurant that I will eat at. Their food is authentic. He said let's try it and it better be good. We get there for lunch and is full as usual. We ordered 2 3 way chimichangas to go. He sat in his car and said let me try it before we leave. He tasted it and he said wow this is pretty good. I live like 10 min away. He kept it on his lap and could not stop eating it at stop lights. By the time we got to my house his plate was gone. I have been going to Ponchos for a couple of decades and that is the only mexican restaurant I will eat at. I normally go out to eat alot of italian and sushi but Ponchos will always draw me back. You have to try their 3 way chimichangas when you go there.
