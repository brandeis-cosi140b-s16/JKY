hands down best grilled chicken place in the phoenix area.  Only takes cash so be sure to bring some.  Their Carne is awesome as well.  If its your first time there try both meats.  Menu options are limited but hey who needs more?  I'm glad not that many people know about this hole in the wall place or there very much could be a line out the door for their yummy chicken!
