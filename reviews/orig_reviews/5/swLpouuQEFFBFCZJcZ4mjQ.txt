I walked into this restaurant at 8:45pm, 15 minutes before they closed and was welcomed with a smile. Not only were they about to close but I wasn't dressed very well to say the least. I value a restaurants quality of service based on how they treat every customer because I've been treated differently based just on my appearance at times. So great job guys! Not only was the service great but the decor and the food was amazing. Definitely check this place out if you are looking to have an intimate dinner with fine dining attributes minus the nose up attitudes of some fine dining restaurants.
