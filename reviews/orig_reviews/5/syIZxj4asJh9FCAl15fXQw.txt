Want a great view of The Strip while you drink your margarita and enjoy good food? COME HERE!

The food here is good and their prices are average. The service is great. They're very accommodating with large parties and children. Their margaritas are great - not too weak. The table-side guacamole is delicious. 

They also give chips, salsa and a bean dip. All three are great. I like having a little bit of salsa and bean dip on my chip.
