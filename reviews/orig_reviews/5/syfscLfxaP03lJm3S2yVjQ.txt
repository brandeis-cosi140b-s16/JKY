This surprising little place near central Phoenix is tantalizingly delicious. As you drive in, please admire the artwork on the buildings and fence behind the restaurant. Amazing. We arrived about 10 minutes before our table-mates but were seated immediately. Our waiter was friendly and so helpful regarding our choices. We started out with the Barrio Bomba Margarita (me) and the Cadillac Margarita (him.) Very nicely iced and mine was rimmed with both sugar and salt - great combination. The bread here that comes with the olive tapenade is absolutely delicious - a wonderful start to our meal. Dinner for hubby was a small bowl of the posole before the Torta del Barrio, a roasted poblano pepper sandwich stuffed with oaxacan cheese. that posole is probably the best we've ever had. I had the Torta de Cochinita Pibil, a rich roasted pork sandwich topped with sweet purple onions. We both had the crunchy french fries on the recommendation of our waiter with the cocktail ketchup dip. Yum. We tried the kahlua chocolate caramel cake for dessert and it was fantastic. Just the right amount of sweet after a filling meal. The food here is so flavorful - not too spicy at all, just the right amount. It wasn't too crowded on a Sunday evening (thankfully) so we didn't have to wait long. They do not take reservations here either - first come, first served by a gracious staff. Get on over there and enjoy.
