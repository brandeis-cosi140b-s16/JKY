The other night I was looking for a good burger and fries. I found this on google maps right down the street from my house. I decided to try it out. This is the best kind on small burger shack that you can have. Quick service, friendly staff, and AMAZING burgers. This even beats out my favorite burger place In-and-Out. Better ingredients better flavors and local. I will be back and next time I will be needing a jar of Stand Sauce for my fries.
