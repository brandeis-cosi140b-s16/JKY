The BEST fish tacos I have ever had!!  My husband and I love this place and are making this a must stop every IKEA trip we make!!  The full and machaca are super good also their fries are very good I even scooped up the extra machaca with my fries and that is a tasty treat!!  They also have amazing ranch dressing!!  Thank you Tortilla Fish!!
