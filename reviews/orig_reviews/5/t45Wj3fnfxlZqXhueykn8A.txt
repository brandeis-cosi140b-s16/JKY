We had the nachos which came out amazing and piled into an impressive pyramid. Expect very large portions! What we really came for though, was the grasshoppers. We'd never seen them on the menu anywhere, so we jumped at the chance to try such a unique food here. We were initially disappointed when the waiter told us that they no longer served them. As we were getting the check the chef came out to talk to us, and when we shared our disappointment he actually told us that the grasshoppers were still being served as an off-menu item. They have two flavors, garlic lime, and habanero. We opted for the habanero and they were amazing, much to our surprise. Would come to eat here again, definitely. Also, the flan is out of this world!
