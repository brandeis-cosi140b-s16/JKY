This is for the bar section.
Been to Vegas a few times, and every time I went with my bros, we stayed at Bally's. The first time we did, he had flown in the day before me so he had already been here. So he told me about something that was on the menu that sparked my interest. We had a few drinks in the room and decided to come here before going out to the club and ordered the "Fish Bowl". That's what we started calling it. It's real name is Electric Fiesta Bowl. This thing is amazing. It tastes great and knocks you on your ass. We have now made it tradition to get these bad boys every time we hit Vegas. If you want to take it on the strip they give you little pitchers. Which pull ladies, let me tell you. They are always curious to know what it is and where you got it. Nothing like rolling on the strip with 2 128 Oz drinks in 4 pitchers.
