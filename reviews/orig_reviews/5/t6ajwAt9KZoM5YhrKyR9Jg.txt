been going there since I was a kid, very good, but noon is when its really busy lot of Good Sam employees will go there so there will be a big line, the bean and cheese is the best, green chile, red chile, chimis, and taco heck everything is good, the only thing is if you eat there its outside on picnic benches but its still nice, this is the best mexican food in the valley
