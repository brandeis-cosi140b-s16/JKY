Rosita's Place is one of my favorite Mexican restaurant in the Valley. I usually get the same thing everywhere I go and base my judgement on that one item. I order the green chili burro enchilida style. Rosita's offering was so good that I sometimes crave it and drive from Scottsdale just to get one. The salsa is always hot, and sometimes hotter, but very good. Just make sure you have your water in front of you before you try it. Any time I have out of town visitors, this is the place I take them.
