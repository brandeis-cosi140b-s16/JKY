*** I gave this 5 stars based on the best Mexican food I've had in AZ, not based on white linen and waiter service, just an fyi***
I won't write too much as it seems that everyone already has. Both locations are GREAT. Some of the best "homestyle" Mexican I've ever had. I usually get the double wrapped enchilada combo that is pure saucy heaven! A great place to call ahead on a friday night when you're exhausted from work and not doing jack, pick up your food, pick up a six pack of Pacifico and head on home. Happiness is a sure bet!
