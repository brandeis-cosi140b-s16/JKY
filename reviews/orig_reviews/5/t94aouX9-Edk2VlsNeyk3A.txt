The food at this place is extremely good. I've been here for breakfast for almost 2 weeks in a row now. When I see the somebody in the back mixing the sauces from scratch and walking around with a huge crate of eggs - I know this place is fresh! And you can taste it! I get the Egg and Steak breakfast burrito every morning. I've had a couple other burritos and everything I've had is tasty. They are huge burritos. I've never been able to finish one. I actually split the burrito down the middle with a coworker every morning. He pays half, I pay half - that's 2 bucks for an awesome breakfast! ok... the slowness. I feel like it /feels/ slow more than it /is/ slow. Because of style of restaurant this appears to be (order at the counter - rather than a waiter) it can feel real slow because you might be expecting fast food. This is not fast food - this is real food - real good.
