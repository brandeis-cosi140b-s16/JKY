After finding this place on yelp, I had to try it.  

Place was busy so I was seated at the bar.  Cassie the bartender was very good at describing the menu and explaining the chef's creations.  It's always awesome to eat at places where the staff knows the chef's inspirations and goals.  She was also very friendly and her recommendations were top notch.

Started off with chips, salsa and table side guacamole.  Everything was especially the guacamole.  It was fresh and very flavor full.

For dinner I had the fillet with candied bacon.  It was cooked perfect and it was very flavorful.  Having tried steaks at many nice steakhouses this place does it well.

I would highly recommend this place if you're in Scottsdale.
