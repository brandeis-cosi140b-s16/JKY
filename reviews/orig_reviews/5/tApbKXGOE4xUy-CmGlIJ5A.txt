On a whim I decided to try this place because yelp tagged it as vegetarian friendly. First of all, my GPS was unable to find this place, and kept making my destination somewhere on Yale St. which is in the super ghetto. Finally, I came to my senses and just read the address and decided it would be right off Decatur...which it is. So even though its located in the vicinity of the ghetto, its on the main drag so its easy to find.

After using Yelp for a while, I find its most helpful in finding "Diamond in the rough" restaurants that you would never have gone to if it had not been for some random review that really got you excited about some random type of food. The best experiences ive had are at some hole in the wall places that have great service and great food. If this is the experience you are looking for, then KoMex is certainly up your alley.

For a while, i've actually wanted to go to China Poblano (Asian Mexican Fusion) in the Cosmopolitan. Even though it is massively overpriced, everyone says its worth it because the entire idea of an asian mexican fusion place is just so entirely ground breaking. Even some random food network talking head said so. While reading the reviews of China Poblano, I find the same sentiment. "Its not that great food wise, but wow! what a great idea!"

KoMex, I believe, is everything China Poblano should have been. KoMex is cheap, innovative, and, most importantly, the food is great! I got the Vegetarian fusion stir-fry burrito and I can't stop thinking about when I can somehow work in another trip to North Decatur to get it again.

KoMex Fusion Express is definitely a keeper.
