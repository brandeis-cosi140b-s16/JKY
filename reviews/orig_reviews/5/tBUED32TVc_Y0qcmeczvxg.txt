If you try one appetizer, you have to try the queso fundido con chorizo! I can eat that and skip dinner. But they have amazing fajitas and burritos. These burritos are awesome bc it's a three meal size burrito... but maybe that's bc I fill up on the queso everytime. Great food, super nice staff. Definitely repeated visit type of place!
