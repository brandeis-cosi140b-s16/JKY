Yes I am going to tell you that I ate this food when they actually served it in a backyard. It's a funny story. I had a friend take me and I thought he was out if his mind as we walked into some random empty looking backyard for some Mexican food. Hahaha it turned out to be pretty busy in the back.


Now the review.

Great food. Good prices. Friendly people. They can be slow at times but other than that it's great.
