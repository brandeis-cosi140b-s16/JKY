Las Gloria's is a favorite neighborhood spot. Good, home style Mexican food with a very friendly staff and fair prices. We eat there once or twice a month and they always remember us. Their fajitas are a favorite - the Suprema (chicken, beef, shrimp) is big enough for two. Ask for extra tortillas if you're going to share. 

They also have some of the best chips and salsa in town, and they are served with an awesome bean dip.
