This restaurant was probably the highlight of the stay. Delicious food and drinks, pleasant atmosphere, very friendly staff. The waitress made many suggestions, one of the bussers who brought out food and drink refills was kind enough to push a second table together for us to fit all of our plates more comfortably. I would highly recommend the organic margarita which is extremely smooth, slightly sweet and amazingly delicious. The boy said it was the best margarita he had ever had. We both got the muddled margaritas (blackberry and rasberry) which were both incredible also.  We got the calamari as an appetizer which was wonderful. The calamari was fried perfectly and wasn't too greasy and were perfectly crunchy. We also go the queso fundito because of all of the reviews we read on here about it, but found it to be unimpressive. Just a big greasy glob of cheese served with tortillas, not quite sure what the appeal is for it. Our main courses were out of this world! We got the skirt steak with the jumbo shrimp that was on special (24 dollars). The steak was smooth and buttery, cooked to perfection. The shrimp were HUGE and rubbed an an amazing cajun rub, just delightful! We also got the lobster which was delicious. Sweet, succulent chunks of lobster served with guac, tortillas, onions, salsa, and everything to make lobster fajitas. The menu says market price, the cost actually ended up being 65 dollars. May sound expensive, but worth every penny. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone craving fantastic food!
