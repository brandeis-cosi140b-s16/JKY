Wow! This was our first time eating here & we loved it! Everything was great, the service but even better was the food. A must have is the Bacon Wrapped Dates & for sure the Paella Valenciana. The shrimp in the paella was perfectly cooked. Chef Oscar Sanchez even came around to greet the patrons. A job well done :-)
