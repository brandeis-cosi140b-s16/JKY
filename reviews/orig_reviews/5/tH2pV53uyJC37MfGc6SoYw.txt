Unpretentious and authentic...

I ate at the bar .. And.. Javier was great mixed me a tasty spicy marg. the chicken cassadieas were yummy.. More than the cassadieas itself the cilantro rice was the best ...

I always go here to get my Mexican fix every time I am in Vegas ..

Very family friendly and right on the canal with great view of the action ..,
