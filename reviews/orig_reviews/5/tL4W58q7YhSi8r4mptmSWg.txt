Believe the hype. 

Delicious Oaxacan Mexican food, most especially the fish tacos [which I pretty much always and sometimes exclusively get]. The guacamole sauce and the fish tacos are all I need. But their horchata and churros also frequently get my attention. 

You can't really go wrong here, I have never had a bad thing. Service is friendly [doubly so if you're patient, and sarcastic] and the decor is like an upscale prison. But it hardly matters, because the food is good enough that you'll be back again and again.

Biggest complaints: 

1] The baggies of onions and peppers [serranos?] that accompany every order are fried in the oil rather than roasted [which would draw out their flavor more in my opinion]

2] They aren't open Sun/Mon :D
