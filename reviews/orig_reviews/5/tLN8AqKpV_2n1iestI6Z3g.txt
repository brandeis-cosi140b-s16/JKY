Let's start this way. I could not decide between pork or beef tacos. I asked the server he said that the chef was known for her pork treatment. Chef ?? pork treatment?? These are words I would have never expected to hear at an airport restaurant. Way cool. And the food itself delicious again very unexpected at an airport. This is not the least expensive place here but well worth it. You are about to be crammed on to a SWA plane at least enjoy this one luxury.
