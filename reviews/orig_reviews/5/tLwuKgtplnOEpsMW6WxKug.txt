What a great place! I wasn't sure if I was going to like a Mexican-Asian fusion restaurant. I was skeptical. I'm happy to report I was pleasantly surprised! My friends told me that it's kind of like a tapas (small plate) menu, so we ordered a bunch of stuff & shared. First out was the "bacon guacamole" which was tasty. Next out was "tempura unagi roll" which was good as well. It reminded me a lot of a Las Vegas roll. We also had the "crispy pork belly roll" which was different. It was pretty good, but I don't normally like pork belly. My friends really liked it though. I also ordered the "Lobster & Crab Dynamite" which was delicious. For a drink I ordered the skinny margarita which was awesome. This is definitely a busy, "where the cool people hang out" type place & I can't wait to try more things off the menu.
