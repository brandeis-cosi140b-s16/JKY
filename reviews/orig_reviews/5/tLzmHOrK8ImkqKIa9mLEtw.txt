After being bitter and insulted over being hit up for a cover charge on one Saturday evening I am adjusting my review. This is our local bar and I have had many great times as the service is always good and the food even better. I took my frustration out in a business that didn't deserve it. Great food and people . Not a fan of the new Saturday night Dj/cover but to each their own there is a place for everyone. My apologies for my anonymous poor review this is a way better place then I gave them credit for. Perhaps a breathalyzer on my yelp account would be helpful
