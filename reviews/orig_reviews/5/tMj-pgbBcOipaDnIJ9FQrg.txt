I'm in love with Crescent's bean & cheese burrito. Plenty of booze to choose from, great vibe and there's always something going on here. Guacamole and chips are from another planet, SO DELICIOUS. Jessica is the best server here, no doubt. Venue wise, Crescent is the best in the valley. The sound is incomparable, and it's a very "intimate" setting, ya dig?
