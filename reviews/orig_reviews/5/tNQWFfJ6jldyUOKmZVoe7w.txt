I have been here 3 times and the food has been consistently good with great service.

For appetizers I hear the ceviche is good (I'm not a ceviche person) but I personally love the duck tamale. 

The lunch menu has a blackened tilapia that is really good for a fair price.

For drinks there are plenty of tequilas and margaritas that are mixed well.
