Two of the people I was with, who lived in New Mexico, proclaimed this place to have amazing New Mexican food. Who am I to argue? I will agree that the food is fantastic and inexpensive. But, if you're sensitive to spicy foods, watch out.

If you're hungry, get the combo burrito ($5.95). It's a veggie burrito with meat. You get your choice of beans (I opted for pinto) plus rice and calabacitas. If you're like me, you'll probably have to ask what that is. Calabacitas are saut√©ed squash, onions, corn and peppers. I also went with the pork verde as my meat choice. If you do want it spicy, get it smothered with your choice of red or green sauce or both. Without the sauces, the food is perfect for people who don't want their mouth on fire. It's probably one of the best burritos in town (at least from what I've tried) and a great value.

Order at the counter and they'll bring the food out to you. Even during non-peak hours the place can be busy so don't be surprised if you have to wait for a table. But, it will be worth it.
