Their  Happy Hour is great.  My husband and I really enjoyed ourselves here.  The specials are pretty decent.  We had the ceviche for a snack and it was delicious as well as half off the regular price.  We will be back.  The bartenders and waiters were very friendly and attentive.  Not really fond of the modern decor, but that's just my taste.  Very glad to find a new Happy Hour place that I feel comfortable in.....
