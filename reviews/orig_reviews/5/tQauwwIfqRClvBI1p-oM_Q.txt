China Poblano is my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas. I make a point to come here every time I'm there (I travel to Vegas for work about 4 times a year).

Summary (on a scale of 1 to 5 stars):
Food: 5 stars
Drinks: 5 stars
Atmosphere: 5 stars
Service: 5 stars
Price: 4 stars

The food is a marriage of Mexican and Asian cuisine. It's unique, and it's delicious. My favorites are the guacamole (medium style has just the right amount of kick); When Pigs Fly (steamed pork buns); Shrimp Mojo (shrimp with sweet black garlic and roasted poblano peppers); pork belly taco, lobster taco, tuna ceviche, and, the all-star, the chocolate terra cotta warrior. It's a chocolate mouse filled warrior-shaped chocolate with ginger ice cream, cookie crumbs, and caramelized banana. It is the most unique dessert I have ever had. Yes, ever. You have to order it. and you won't be disappointed.

Drinks: Food: The margaritas are phenomenal. You should get a pitcher.

Atmosphere: Vibrant, lively, and fun. 

Service: 5 starts. All the servers I've had have been knowledgeable and attentive. Food starts coming out almost right away and continues to come out as it's ready. The hostesses are friendly too.

Price: It's not a cheap place, but it's worth the extra $ because the food is so good. Just not a place to come if you're on a budget. Definitely a place to come if you value a great meal.

Can't wait for my next trip.
