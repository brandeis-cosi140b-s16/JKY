Holy tacos. The tacos, salsa, and guac are superb!  The portions are large and well worth the price. On my last visit I tried the corn tamale with shimp.... Excellent! Thanks for the tip fellow yelpers. 

Oh an the wine pours are very generous which of course I love. 

Minus one star because the inside could use a facelift it's rather dark and not very inviting. However, the outside is beautiful so sit outside if the weather permits.
