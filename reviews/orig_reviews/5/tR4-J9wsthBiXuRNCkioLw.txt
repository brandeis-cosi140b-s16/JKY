As good as it gets. We have not gotten better Mexican food in Las Vegas. I come from the Mid West, my husband comes from the North West, we have searched for over 3 years to find equivalent Mexican here and at last have found it! My chicken enchilada with mole sauce to die for and his big burrito the size of your face. Check out the photos here, very helpful.

Ambience a notch up from fast food, great wait staff, nice decor, comfortable chairs, great prices. Seats 50. We spent $24 dinner for 2, and were stuffed. Couldn't eat it all & took home leftovers. If you are looking for impression, take your date to Mundo (restaurant in World Market Center, $$$), if you just want great Mexican food, in a nice setting, at a really great price ($). Go here. We will be going again & again.
