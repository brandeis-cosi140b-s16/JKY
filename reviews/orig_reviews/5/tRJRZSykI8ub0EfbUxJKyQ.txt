Very friendly location!  The workers here seem to genuinely enjoy their jobs, or at least put on a good attitude about it - even during busy lunch time.  Got my order quickly and correctly.  The inside is a little small but I always take it to go, so that doesn't impact my view on this one.

I actually tried the tofu here and it's not that bad.  Plus when I went, I got a coupon for a free burrito because I tried it.  Not too shabby.
