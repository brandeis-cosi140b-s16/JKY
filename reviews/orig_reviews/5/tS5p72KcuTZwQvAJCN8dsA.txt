My girlfriend and I like to frequent the movie theater in the Scottsdale Quarter but we only stop for dinner and Sol is our spot! We first came here in October of last year because of our first date and it has been our spot ever since I always get the chicken burrito with some lettuce wraps and the shrimp firing squad, makes me hungry just thinking about it. Our favorite server has to be Holden! He is always on point with our orders especially mine because I like to change things up a lot. He is also a genuine good person and seems to enjoy his job and takes a lot of pride at it. we've been going here for about a year and he has always been our server. I don't usually write stuff about the servers of restaurants but this guy always goes above and beyond I'm surprised he doesn't have his own restaurant. As for the food it's always good and very fresh I should probably change it up and start trying some new things but you can never go wrong with a chicken burrito lol.
