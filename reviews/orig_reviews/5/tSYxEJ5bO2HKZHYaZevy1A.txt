Awesome food at even more amazing prices.
I was in vegas and had searched some of the good places to try and Komex came up. I took my parents and we drove over. 
We each ordered a bulgogi burrito. we also tried a pork taco and a bulgogi taco. I have had korean fusion before, but this was even better. The food does take a while to come out, but its worth the wait. 
Oh and while you are waiting for your food-they serve homemade chips  with guac and salsa- delish! 

totally worth the drive from the strip. total meal for 4 of us was under $30 wtih tax-- yay! 
oh and they serve bottled water instead of tap as part of your meal- so nice!
Love you Komex
