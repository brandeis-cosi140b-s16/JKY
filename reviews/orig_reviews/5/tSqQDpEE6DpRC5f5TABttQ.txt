I love this joint .. got nothing bad to say at all!  All of the wait staff are good but there a few that provide such GREAT service that you will be blown away.  AND get this, if you go a few times, some will recognize you and come to the table to see how you've been doing, even if you aren't at one of their tables.  Top that off with a creative menu and excellent execution and you've got one great date night!  I can't recommend this spot enough!
