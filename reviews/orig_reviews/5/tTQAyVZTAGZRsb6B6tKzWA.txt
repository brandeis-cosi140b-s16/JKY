Holy Guacamole Batman! Second time I've ate at Paco's and I must say, they live up to the great reviews and I'm not even a Mexican food kinda guy, but sweet fancy moses they have great tacos. Not like your ordinary cheap tacos - these are well made with great ingredients. Always...I mean ALWAYS order the Unholy Guacamole - they make it in front of your and it is delisioso...I believe that is Spanish for tasty. The girls digg the margaritas too and I'll always toss back a Corona while I'm at it. Gracious once again Paco.
