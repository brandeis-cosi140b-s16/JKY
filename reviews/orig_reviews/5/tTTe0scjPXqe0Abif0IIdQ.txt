amazing mexican food in a casual, slightly upscale environment, if that's possible in a strip mall.  very nicely done interior and clean outdoor patio.  they actually have a full bar and a flat screen, so i imagine it would be a fun spot to catch a big soccer match. 

the street tacos are fantastic, and the sauces and salsa are delicious.  friendly employees, no problems with service.  this is our local spot for quick, fresh, and delicious mexican.
