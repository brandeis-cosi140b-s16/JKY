Las Cazuelas is my favorite spot for Mexican food in town. A small quaint family-run hole in the wall that seats less than 15 people with good service and food? My kind of place. It is their Mole Poblano and Chile Relleno that are the definite standouts. And where else will you be able to have Chanclas, Pelonas, Molletes, or Esquites? Their approach is traditional, so if you're looking for burritos, fast food, or supersized portions then go elsewhere. Here just order a dish or two off the menu, grab a Mexican Coca Cola, and treat yourself to a well-deserved eating break.
