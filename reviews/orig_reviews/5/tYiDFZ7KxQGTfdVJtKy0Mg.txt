Probably my favorite breakfast spot. Depending on my mood, this is how it's done, eggs are either over easy or poached:
Shrimp enchiladas -- red and green chile
Huevos Rancheros  -- red and green chile
Carne Adovada  -- red only 

Lately, it's been a lot of enchilada, though I feel the huevos rancheros starting a resurgence!

Breakfast entrees are about $10 -12 and worth every penny.
