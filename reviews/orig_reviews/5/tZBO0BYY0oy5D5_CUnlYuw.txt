Today was my 2nd visit and it was spectacular again! I live in Los Angeles, I've tried all types of Mexican food, BUT HERE at El Dorado there is a "passion" in the food and I realized why once we met CHEF PACO. He is very passionate about his food and even mentioned to us his family history  and how authentic his recipes were coming from Mexico City. The habanero orange sauce is screaming and it will surely make you CRY. but in a great way! and if you order the Flan, order Your OWN! no sharing! lol. enjoy and Thank you again Chef Paco and El Dorado! 
Your friends from Los Angeles, CA!
