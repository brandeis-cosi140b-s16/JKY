OMG I love it.  Almost 2 years living in the Coronado and Phoenix and my life is empty without Americas burritos.  I've even told the husband that if we ever leave, Americas is the first place we stop at when we come back to visit (we have family here).

We have the joy of living a half mile walk away, and this is our neighborhood burrito joint.  Between the delicious salsa, carne asada burritos and the Mexican bottled sodas, my life is utterly complete!  (the margs are good as well as is the Cochata...mmmm)

When it's busy, the wait time usually isn't too bad because they're busting out food pretty quick, it the slow afternoons or weeknights that mean you can wait a little longer for take out.  That being said, eating in is always good especially with the happy hour specials or the refills on chips and salsa.

I'll be honest, if I'm having a crap day or didn't get to make dinner, this is what I want.  Their food and a good Mexican coke always makes my day better.
