We recently stayed at Planet Hollywood, and found ourselves with a group at Cabo Wabo.  The people we were with sucked, so the manager, Lou, and bartenders John and Nikki were AMAZING.  John made us the best bloody marys we've ever had - we like them super spicy - and showed us a great time.  We went back the next 2 days to have Lou treat us wonderfully.  The service was fantastic, drinks were great, and the food that we did eat was enjoyable.  Having such a great experience here definitely added to our already wonderful trip!!
