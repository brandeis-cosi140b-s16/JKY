I absolutely cannot describe the amazingness that is La Condesa Gourmet Taco Shop. Gourmet it is. From the top to the bottom. Service, Style, Food, the whole 9. Do not be fouled by the neighborhood... this place SHINES like a diamond in the rough. 

I am SOOO bummed that we were only in Phoenix for the night, cause I would have set up shop here every night. THE SALSA BAR!!! AHHH! We tried EVERY ONE. AMAZING. 

Our amazing bartender/server was David. He killed it. He even made me a Skinny Margarita. They make their own juices there for the Margs...mmmmm. Yep. 

They are authentic. The fish is fresh. They put up with me wanting no oil and after ordering 1 taco... he put up with me ordering 2 more, after the place should have been closed. This was all done with a smile and kindness that is unfortunately rare these days. 

Even just thinking about that taco... Grilled Mahi w/ a ton of veggies, spinach, onions,  wrapped in a homemade tortilla, guac, TONS of dipping sauces... literally melted in my mouth.

If you are EVER in the Phoenix area--- YOU MUST STOP BY. If I am even an hour with-in it's radius I will be running back.

Not. To. Be. Missed.
