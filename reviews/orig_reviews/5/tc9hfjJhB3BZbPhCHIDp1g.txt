Exceeded expectations! The pork chop was huge and came with TWO pork chops, sides of delicious broccolini and asparagus and a stuffed green chili pepper! The place is atmospheric (dark) and small (you will inevitably jostle your neighbors) but in a good way. Love the New Mexican cuisine and even the happy hour beer (which we'd never heard of before) was surprisingly amazing. If you are in Phoenix, you should definitely check out Dick's Hideaway.
