No reason not to eat here. Looks to be a family owned place, inside is very clean, one good tv and a nice bar set up.  

Incredibly affordable prices and the food was super tasty. Had the sliders as an appetizer, and there was probably too much meat. I had the beef bowl with the fried egg on top. A combination of the spicy peppers and their Korean sauce had me sweating pretty good as I ate, and I loved it. 

Flautas were good too, 3 very good sized pieces. They also had Mexican coke in the glass bottle which is always nice. 

3 items + the coke was only $27. Felt like it should have been more for how good it was. Definitely will return.

I would go just for the complimentary chips and salsa/guac. Chips were great.
