One of the Arizona things we miss most after moving to Southern California is regular doses of great food from Los Dos Molinos.  Back in the day we frequented the Mesa and South Mountain locations and enjoyed the food prepared by Victoria and her family.  Today we dropped in on the newest family location in Ahwatukee and were delighted to get reacquainted with Cheryl and her staff.  Everything was wonderfully prepared and piping hot from the kitchen.  When we inquired about a favorite dessert that wasn't on the menu  -- fried tortilla strips powdered with cinnamon sugar and drizzled with honey -- Cheryl offered to make them for us special.  What a great ending to an amazing lunch.  The food exceeded our pleasant memories and we couldn't have been more warmly greeted.  No menu recommendations are needed because everything is flavorful and uniquely Los Dos!
