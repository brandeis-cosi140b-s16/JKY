Went with a group of 4 hungry dudes,  and they were all more than satisfied. Steak quesadilla,  pork carnitas and pork with green chili all got five star ratings from the table. Chips and salsa were great as well,  and affordable. 9bucks for a quesadilla and a drink. Great little spot,  clean and compfy,  with friendly guys working. Check it out!
