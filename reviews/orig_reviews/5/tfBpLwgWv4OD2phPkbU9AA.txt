Magnificent is the word that comes to mind. Ashley is awesome. Happy hour is amazing. The street tacos are the best. The margarita is made with fresh lime juice and organic agave. The rest falls right into place. Absolutely the best of the best in the Mexican food category. Plus the staff is extremely welcoming from the beginning to the end. A++
