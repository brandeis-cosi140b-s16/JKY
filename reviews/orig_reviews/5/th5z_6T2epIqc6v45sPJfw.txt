Yep. Delicious. Only been here once but it was fantastic and a good portion for the price. I got the grilled fish, chicken, and the carne asada tacos, and they were all bomb. The staff was nice and the atmosphere was laid back, just how I like it. Any taco you get is great. I go to Grand Canyon so this is a spot that many students go to. Will definitely be returning many times!
