Looking for a Mexican Breakfast in Las Vegas? Yeah harder than it looks, this place hit the spot and the tamales were amazing. Try the Queso (Cheese); its so worth the price! Granted it's a bit steep but it's really worth it. To be honest I didn't try lunch/dinner menu but we were looking for a breakfast and we found it.
