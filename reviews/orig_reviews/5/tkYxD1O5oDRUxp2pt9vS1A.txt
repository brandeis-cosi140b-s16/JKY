Great, great tacos. I'm a big guy and I inhaled six tacos straight away. My wife is slim and petite. She also packed away six tacos and was looking for more. As you enter the restaurant you will notice three stations at the front counter. Each station has a tip jar(?) and on each jar is listed the types of tacos prepared at that station. We had lengua, tripas and cabeza tacos. All tender and succulent. Did I just use "succulent"? The horchata is from a powder mix. I can cope. The grilled peppers are fantastic alongside the tacos. Norteno/Banda music blaring. Stuffed bull heads mounted on the walls. Go with an open mind and a healthy appetite and have a good time. One of my coworkers asked if she needed a passport to travel to this part of town. Funny Anglo.
