A MUST if you're in Vegas!! (: My extended family actually owns the restraunt but I promise I'm not biased.  The food is authentic, all family recipes! It's delicious I swear. I always get the camarones a mojo de ajo, or the pollo amador(my grandpas recipe). It's all so delicious but remember this is authentic, if you want that Taco Bell shit this is NOT the place for you.  Oh and don't forget about the homemade tortillas too! they're delishh.
