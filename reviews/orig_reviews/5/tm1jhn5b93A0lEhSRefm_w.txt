I rate this place five stars because it is as good as it gets.  Forget the dummies that complain about it being dark, small, like a bar, too spicy, too meaty, whatevs.  The food is great if you are into spicy SW Cuisine, similar to what you find in Santa Fe. My wife and I have enjoyed the shrimp pizza with smoked cheese multiple times (hint, dip it in red sauce).  Blackened chicken caesar is awesome.  Posole is phenomenal, and I also love enchiladas and eggs. Bloody Mary is drink of choice at this place, but they do serve nice wines.
