This place is amazing! I always want to go here. The flour chips are unbelievably good! We always have to ask for more flour ones. You eat the corn chips because you feel bad for them, but the flour is where it's at. I always have their Courtney's Favorite Spicy Chicken Burrito (something like that). It is spicy, and it is soooo good. So much flavor and heat! They also have an amazing prickly pear margherita. It goes down like dessert, but it can be dangerous.
