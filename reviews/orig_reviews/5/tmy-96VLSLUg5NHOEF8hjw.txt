We had lunch here after conquering Camelback Mtn...  ; )

The table side made guacamole is OUTSTANDING...my wife got the steak tacos and really like them and I got the pork tacos and they were okay.  The tacos portions are smaller, but the prices are fair, the service is really good and the guacamole is well worht the trip!
