The street tacos are delicious, and topped off with a house Margarita and a beautiful spring evening, it doesn't get much better than this! We always take friends and family here when visiting and they always ask to go to the Canteen when they are back in town. Great food, drinks, and atmosphere.  Another perk is how much later their HH goes. Us 8-5 workers are actually able to make it and enjoy it!
