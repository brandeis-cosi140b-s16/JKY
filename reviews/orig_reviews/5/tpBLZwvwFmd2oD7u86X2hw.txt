This is an excellent place for quick Mexican food.  The staff is super friendly, they will let you try food first if you ask what something is.
We ordered Carne Asada Tacos, Carnitas Tacos, and Chicken Tacos.  The Carne Asada tacos were excellent.  They are grilled and have a nice flame grilled taste.
The seafood "Coctel" was awesome - I wish I would have ordered a double!
My 2 year old ate a whole plate of rice and beans.  Their beans are simple and delicious.
My wife had us go back the next day for their Strawberry Horchata!
Price is definitely fair - the tacos are BIG.  We went their for the first time on Monday and have been back 2x's since.
We eat Mexican food regularly, and this is a MUST.
