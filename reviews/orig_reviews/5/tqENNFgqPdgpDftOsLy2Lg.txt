This place is great.  The food is spiced and cooked perfectly.  We had the appetizer sampler platter and everything on it was delicious.  I had the Masas de Puerco Fritas, my husband had the Vaca Fritas de Pollo -- both were superb - tender & juicy.  We couldn't stop eating it.  Black beans & rice were the best I've ever had.  Staff is friendly.  The restaurant's decor makes you feel like you're in Cuba.  We'll definitely go back.
