Every time I have come to Aunt Chilada's I've had a great time along with some delicious Mexican food. I've tried their fajitas, enchiladas, quesadilla, torta, taquitos, and even the fired ice cream (don't typically get dessert at Mexican restaurants) and all have been very good. For what it's worth, I once went with a friend who doesn't like Mexican and she said Aunt Chilada's had one of the best burgers she's ever had. I can't vouch for that though. I recently tried the El Pollo Fundito and it was awesome. Probably about 2000 calories, but awesome.

This place is huge! Lots of indoor and outdoor seating. The outdoor patio is my favorite on a beautiful spring evening. Great happy hour. A perfect place for group events. Live music on Friday nights. Trivia on Wednesday nights. Bocce Ball outside. Friendly staff each and every visit. Nice view of Piestewa Peak!

I really don't get some of the negative reviews of this place. Each of my dozen or so visits to Aunt Chilada's have been very positive and I will continue to return.
