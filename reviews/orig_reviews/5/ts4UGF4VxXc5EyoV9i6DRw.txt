This place is amazing food is super good and made to share so if you go by yourself like I did it's easy to make friends and enjoy other around you. I recommend the shrimp enchiladas, tacos and the fried plantain. If you sit at the bat ask for Malerie and let her create you a cocktail.  This is a place you need to try great decor, service and food
