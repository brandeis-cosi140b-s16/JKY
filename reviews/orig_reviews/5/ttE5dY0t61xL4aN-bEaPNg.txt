I have a family with three young kids. We have lived in this area for two years and have passed by this place many times.  Always turned off from going in because we thought is was a gaming lounge since they have this really large 24 hour gaming sign... Plus no windows, etc but a nice looking building.

We walked in the doors and the place is very, very nice and clean.  Now gaming/bar setting in the dinning area.

To the food.  It was great!!!! Chips, salsa, guacamole all very good and fresh.  Kids loved their food.  I had a steak burrito which was very good.

Service was also very nice and attentive.  This will be our new spot for when we want sit down Mexican.
