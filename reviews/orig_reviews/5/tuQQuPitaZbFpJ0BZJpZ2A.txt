This is one of the best mid-sized music venues I have been to in years. The bartenders were friendly and attentive, and they seem to run a tight ship there. I plan on going back to try the food at some point. The interior is very nicely decorated, the stage is more spacious than most stages at similar venues, and they actually believe in leaving the air conditioning on when a band is playing! Trust me, it was much appreciated. I plan on being back, and soon!
