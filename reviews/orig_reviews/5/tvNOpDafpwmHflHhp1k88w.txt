There really are few words to describe how perfect the food is, how delectable the salas are, how great the waitstaff is, and how awesome the vibe is. Sufficeth to say, we come here at least twice a month (we have to hold ourselves back!).

Since my husband's from SoCal and I'm a born and bred Austinite, we both grew up eating delicious Mexican food. But I have to say that La Condesa truly beats out even my favorite spots in San Diego or Austin (sorry, hometown! you still have the best migas!). They are truly Taco Royalty.

Our favorite tacos: Mayan Cochinita Pibil, Arrachera (carne asada), the El Guacho, and the shark taco. Also, you must try their margaritas and horchata!
