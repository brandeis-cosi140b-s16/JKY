Best tortillas ever hands down. I feel like I'm in tortilla heaven. Especially on Tuesdays. I always attempt to eat two tacos on taco Tuesday, but always ending up eating one because it's so filling. Sweet pork mmm and their rice is so good too and limey. The perfect balance. Food coma for days! If my body allowed me to eat 100 sweet pork tacos then I would.
