What can be said that hasn't already - the fantastic guacamole (probably the best I've ever tasted), the addicted spicy fries and even-spicer ketchup, and the knock-your-socks-off-fan-freakin-tastic cochinita pibil. All incredible. I'd fly back to Phoenix just to eat here again. Til next time Barrio Cafe.
