Came here to eat for my boyfriends 21st birthday lunch, as soon as we walked in we were immediately seated which I was thrilled about. THEN right when we sat down they already brought us chips & salsa & asked for our drinks, then took our order. We were literally only in the restaurant for 15 min & our entree was already on our table!! I was blown away! Everyone who passed our table asked if we needed anything. Best service I've ever received EVER!
