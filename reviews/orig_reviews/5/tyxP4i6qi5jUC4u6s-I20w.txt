El Zocalo is my birthday spot every year! I cant get enough of their margaritas and fine mexican food.  I like going there on the weekends for the live music when the dinner floor transitions over to a dance floor and the fun begins.  Its so conveniently placed and I recommend it to everyone.  I like that I can take my whole family and children as well.
