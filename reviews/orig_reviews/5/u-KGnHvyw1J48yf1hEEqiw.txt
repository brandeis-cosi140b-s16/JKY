Yes! So maybe it wasn't the best tex mex I've ever had but still I loved this place. We went on. Tuesday night at 9 and it was pretty packed. It's a cool open atmosphere and I'm sure people go there to hang out and drink but since my husband and I don't do alcohol we go places to eat. They were fast and efficient and our waitress was on top of it even though she clearly had lots of other tables. We didn't wait at all. What a cool place. The only bad thing as with all places in that area is parking, ugh
