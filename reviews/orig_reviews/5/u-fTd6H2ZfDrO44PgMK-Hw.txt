Carolina's West is not only friendly, but their food is incredible! My usual is the red and bean burrito, enchilada style. Their red chili is rich with chunks of beef, combine that with their delicious beans wrapped in a tortilla that's large enough to be a baby blanket topped with enchilada sauce, cheese and scallions, and you have a meal that good enough to slap your nana over! Carolina's West, a happy, family environment that once you experience it, you'll keep coming back over and over again. Tell Gina and Anna that I sent you.
