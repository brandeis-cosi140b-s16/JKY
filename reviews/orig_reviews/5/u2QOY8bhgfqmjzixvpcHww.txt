Wow, we were so impressed with this place! My breakfast burrito was DELICIOUS ad had a great local beer called the kiltslinger.. And the meal was large and reasonably priced! So large I have a nice leftover to take in the plane since on US Airways you can't have food or even a small snack without being charged for it.  Unbelievable.

The atmosphere was nice with TVs playing sports everywhere and our waitress was really nice. She even took a special requests from me to remove peppers and add chicken to my dish.

This place really surpassed expectations for an airport bar. It is now up there with that fox sports bar in Charlotte as one of my favorites.
