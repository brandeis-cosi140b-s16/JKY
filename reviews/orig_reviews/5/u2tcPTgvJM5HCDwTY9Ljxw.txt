This place is great. Came here when I 1st moved to Phoenix about 7 months ago. I live so close by so I had to try it. The carne asada tacos are great. Nice grilled onion, only $1. The meat it nicely seasoned. The owner of the place is a real nice guy. The service it not that quick, but the quality of the food mos def makes up for it. I would visit this place all the time.
