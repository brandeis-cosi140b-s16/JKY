Very satisfied with this restaurant. The food here has actually been one of my biggest highlights of my vacation here in Vegas. Mariscos Playa Escondida is truly a gem and if you're ever in Vegas or passing by it, it's definitely worth the stop. I had the Molcajete con Mariscos. It was delicious, very wide selection of seafood on the molcajete and it's topped off with a nice layer of cheese. My girlfriend had Agua Chiles and I tried out some from her plate and it was probably the best Agua Chiles I have EVER had. Service is great and the staff here is very friendly. Definitely recommend it! 5***** next time I come to Vegas this will be my first place to come stop by.
