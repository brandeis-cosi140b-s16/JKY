Great find!

The menu is as creative as it is delicious. When delivered the food lives up to the photos. I had the PV Burger. The sauce was tasty, the havarti cheese a nice touch, ground beef yum, and the sweet onions topped it off. So, basically all quality ingredients. And the seasoned fries were a nice compliment to the burger.

I look forward to when they get their liquor license so I can have a brewskie with my burger.

And Brent, the owner is a super cool guy. Wishing him much success.
