My time at La Salsa Cantina was memorable.  Originally, I did not come here to eat the food.  Just wanted to check out the salsa night vibe.  My group and I originally went to Hakkasan at MGM to enjoy some Calvin Harris; however, Hakkasan was just too crowded and the music was mediocre at best.  So we left and decided to check out this Salsa Cantina.  We heard the latin music outside which got us a tad bit interested.  Once we got in, it took a little while to get a table, but, eventually, we got one and ordered a couple margaritas, a strong drink I don't remember the name of, and two long yard frozen margaritas.  Let me just say, the drinks are delicious and are probably the strongest you'll ever find in Vegas.  The prices is cheap considering the location on the strip.  We also ordered the nachos which ended up being amazing drunk food lol.  Now, the dance floor, it is pretty small, but to be fair, they had a lot of space around the tables to where you did not have to stick with the dance floor.  The music consisted of a lot of salsa, bachata, merengue, and reggaton.  The atmosphere is fun.  If you're looking for a great time to relax and just dance, eat, and drink, this is the place to go on a Saturday night.  Our waitress, Rosy, was really attentive, thoughtful, and was just overall wonderful.  Loved her customer service!
