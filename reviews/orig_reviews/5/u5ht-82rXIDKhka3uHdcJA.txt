I've been here once but I'm willing to give it a 4.5-5.0 rating. The food and service were both excellent.

Although they are the torta kings, I had the King Steak Tacos and they were perfect. I do know if they're making their own corn tortillas, but it doesn't matter because you're not going to find much better. They used skirt or flank steak and they wisely cut it against the grain. It was super tender and perfectly marinated. They topped the tacos with grilled jalapenos and onions, with a bit of fresh cilantro. No BS shredded cabbage or other whack gringo-garnish. All the tacos come with rice, which I could just sit and eat for a full day. Hands down the best Mexican rice I've had in this country.

This is simply central Mexican fare at its best, served in a family atmosphere. I can't wait to try the tortas!
