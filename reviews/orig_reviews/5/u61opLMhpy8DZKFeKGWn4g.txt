I've never had a bad experience. I've actually never had anything but a wonderful experience here. The Brûlée Burger is my favorite but there's other great ones to pick from. There's also always really good weekly specials. 

There's a lot more than just burgers on the menu but it's impossible for me to not order a burger whenever I go. So, unfortunately, I can't comment on other items.
