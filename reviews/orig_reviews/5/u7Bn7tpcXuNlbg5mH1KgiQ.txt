This is a must dine experience while in Scottsdale.  The table side Guacamole is the best my family has ever eaten.  My kids devoured the crispy pork & cola lime glaze.  The pork shoulder that my son and I shared was heavenly.  My daughter found the Mahi Mahi Tacos fantastic.  The best fish tacos that she has ever eaten.  The Pumpkin bread pudding and fried bananas for desert were exceptional.  

I have been to the mission several times for business, and I have never been disappointed.
