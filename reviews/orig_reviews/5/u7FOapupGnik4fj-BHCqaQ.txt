Let me start by saying, they seriously have the best elote I've ever bought at a restaurant, it was juicy and delicious, not dry like most other places. The asada taco was delicious, there could have been more asada on my asada fries, and the line is kinda long to wait in. But they have a great variety of toppings and sauces. Normally I can't get avocado because it's always mixed with tomatoes and onions, which I hate, but here you have the option to just add the avocado. The design is amazing, doesn't look anything like a taco place. And they have modelo on draught. Awesome place.
