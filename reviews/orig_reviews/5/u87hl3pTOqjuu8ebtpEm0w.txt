I was there last Saturday with my cousin, who was there for the first time on her birthday!  Javier, and company just can't be beat!  The food, location, service, atmosphere is the BEST!  No one comes close.  No one else is as consistent as "Lindo"  The food was hot, quality, portion size.  We were hungry, we saw, we ate, we drank, we enjoyed!  We will be back.  Next time with more people!  My cousin LOVED IT!  Get a seat by the window!  The view is spectacular day or night and is worth waiting for!
