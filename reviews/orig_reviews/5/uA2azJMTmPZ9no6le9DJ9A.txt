O.... M..... G....

This place is so awesome I can't even get valley girl enough!  Had this place not been on Triple D I would have never stepped foot in this place.  But this is NOT like those fast food joints that sell donuts, chinese food, and fried chicken.  Not even close.  This place is so good!!!!

It's not healthy- but who cares!  I love getting the teriyaki chicken in a quesadilla (teriyaki sauce on the side) and the jade chicken is good in ANYTHING!  Throw in some chicken fried rice and some refried beans and you have the makings for awesomeness.

My husband made a comment that this is the food that I'm going to crave when I'm pregnant.  Well, I'm not pregnant but I am craving it ALL THE TIME!!!

I can't sing it's praises enough!  Be prepared though, the secret is out and the place gets busy.  You will not be sorry though :)

I LOVE YOU CHINO!
