Fresh and delicious!  I went at lunchtime and had a chicken tomatillo enchilada and a green chile pork enchilada with corn tortillas, green sauce and habanero salsa, and a side of chips and guac.  I was a newbie and overwhelmed with all of the choices, so next time might load it up a bit more!  The food was very flavorful.  I will definitely be back.
