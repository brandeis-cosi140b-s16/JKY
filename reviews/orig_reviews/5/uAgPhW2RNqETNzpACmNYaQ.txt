My boyfrined and I went here on Monday night and loved it! He had a pizza and I had a wonderful chicken dish (the name escapes me right now) stuffed with spinach and a wonderful roasted onion sauce, it also came with amazing mashed sweet poatoes and veggies. 
I have a gluten allergy and our server Nick was very helpful in finding out what I could and couldn't eat. He was super nice and patient with us-we kept having to ask for more time to order because everything looked so good haha! 
This resturant is very romantic, the service is good and I would definitely go back!
