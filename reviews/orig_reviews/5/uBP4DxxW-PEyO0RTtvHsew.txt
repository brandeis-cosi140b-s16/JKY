This restaurant is fantastic in every way, it offers a multi-sensory experience which is impressive in terms of ambiance in addition to food and drink.

The amount of thought and intentionality is evident in the way that many small details are well attended to including the use of Himalayan Rock Salt bricks to keep tortillas warm to the interior reflecting a classic Latin American mission through lighting and catholic symbology.

If you don't like it, you shouldn't be writing restaurant reviews for others. Enjoy.
