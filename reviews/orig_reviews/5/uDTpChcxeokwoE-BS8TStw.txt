Holy crap, these are massive sandwiches.

On the recommendation of my boss (who very obviously saw this on Man vs Food, despite his denials), I made my way over to this place to try one of their tortas.  The bread is fantastic.  Light, super soft, hearty enough to hold the sandwich together, crusty enough to give you a nice grip, while it doesn't bring much in flavor or texture, it absorbs so much of the flavors of the ingredients.  Usually a negative for me when the bread doesn't serve a bigger role, but when there is so much going on otherwise, I'll make an exception here.

I love the breaded beef.  The meat is super tender and there's a lot of flavor coming from either the breading or the beef (can't tell).  Also, the mexican sausage (not sure if it's just the chorizo) is good spicy.  In the portions they use relative to everything else, it balances out, but you get these nuggets of real heat - much appreciated.  I do wish the house guacamole had a bit more heat it to it, because as is, it acts more as a palette cooler.

Also... fried egg on a sandwich - not new, but  there's something super breakfasty about it in these tortas.  Don't get me wrong, it was delicious, but there was a nagging feeling that I was eating breakfast.  Not that there's anything wrong with breakfast for lunch or dinner.

Ambiance inside is very casual and relaxed.  Wait staff weren't the friendliest and I often felt like I was waiting for them to finish their personal conversations.  Food came up fast.  Already looking forward to many future visits and many future tortas.
