I read somewhere today that Carolina's uses a ton of lard in cooking their tortillas and I say... awesome.  Use whatever you have to Carolina's but keep that taste sensation coming.  

My normal order, because I can't bear to be at Carolina's and not have this, is the green machaca burro, add potatoes.  And it's amazing.  Every single flipping time, it's amazing.

I'm really happy I just ate (unfortunately non-Carolina's) or else I would be seriously tempted to abandon work and drive the 8 miles for that burro right now.
