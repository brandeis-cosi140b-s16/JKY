Had an early dinner there last week and received excellent food (White fish taco, black beans, and rice) and great service. Sat at the bar, watched TV, drank a beer, talked with the bartender, and savored every bite. It's hard to beat Cabo for the food (delicious every time) and atmosphere (casual and very eclectic). 

Can't go wrong with Cabo! (But come early to find parking in NoDa - only negative aspect to the whole deal).
