This place is awesome.  Looks like a true hole-in-the-wall from the outside. Very unassuming.  But inside is actually quite nice with colorful chandeliers and a nice bar area - bathrooms were nice too-  

The food is phenomenal.  And cheap!!!  Go on Tuesdays - special is the carne adovada.  And the carne adovada is to die for.  Two people can easily split one order and be totally full.  You can cut the meat with a spoon.  Mmmmm so yummy just thinking about it.  I want to try other food choices but I just know I won't be able to tear myself away from re-ordering the adovada.  

Everyday of the week a different menu choice is on special so make a week out of Blue Adobe :)
