During lunch hour the wait is a little long but goes by pretty fast! They have seating inside and outside. Keep in mind it's a little small but you won't care. Pictures of the burgers on the wall! They have also been on Diners Drive Inns and Dives. They bring out your food and call out your name! Laid back music like sublime, 311 type. I enjoy my visit every time! The guys that work here are absolutely wonderful! During a busy day they keep their cool and stay smiling!!!
