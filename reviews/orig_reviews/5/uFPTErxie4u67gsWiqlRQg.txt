While in Vegas, I was craving a good breakfast burrito. We found this place and let me tell you....BEST BREAKFAST BURRITO I'VE EVER HAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The bacon, eggs, cheese, potatoes and pico de gallo salsa were perfect together, but the real winner was the homemade huge tortilla. The burrito was so good we ended up going there twice in 4 days. The place was clean, quick and they even have a 24hour drive thru.

Prices are excellent! The breakfast burrito was $4 and there was an unlimited salsa bar with chunky, green and red salsa. I would 100% recommend this place and can't wait to go back!
