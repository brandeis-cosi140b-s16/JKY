Awesome joint! I had the carnitas burrito and it did not disappoint. It had a crispy texture to it that was flavorful. I'm not sure if they're suppose to hand out chips and salsa but I had asked if they had a house salsa of some sort, mind you i only wanted the salsa but it seems like the owner brought out chips and salsa, on the house. Which i thought was a nice gesture whether it was a standard or thoughtful of him. Food was delicious.

So I decided to come back a second time to try out the shrimp burrito and honestly, it was disappointing. Felt like the ingredients lacked something that I cannot wrap my tastebuds around. It tasted good overall, ingredients were fresh but burrito itself left desiring something else. The only saving grace to that burrito was their salsa which was terrific and it added depth to the burrito.  Their food is still tremendous and I will gladly come back.
