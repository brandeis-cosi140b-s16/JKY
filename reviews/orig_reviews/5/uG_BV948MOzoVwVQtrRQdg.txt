To simply label this another variety of Mexican restaurant would be disingenuous.  On any given night when it's cooler you can smell the Pecan wood burning in the grill when you drive past. The menu is labeled by the owners as "New Mexican" cuisine, and can pass just about any sort of snob test for its price range and even a bit higher- although the facade of the building and the overall feel of the place is a bit downscale.

The salsa is medium with a genuine smoky flavor, the salads are fantastic with European style Goat and Mexican Cotija cheeses, and the Chicken and Pork entrees are far and away better , and more original, than anything you will find in a shopping center close the I-10 in Chandler. If you choose something other than the normal Southwestern style fare: Enchilada/Relleno/ Chimichanga (which are good), you will most likely be treated to the taste of a real pecan fire. For dessert try a Southwestern Tiramasu- Wow.
