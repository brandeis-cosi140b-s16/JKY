Super Yummy!  Found the listing for this place when someone in the party Googled "Mexican food".  So we pild into two cabs...cabbie has never heard of the place.  We are driven to a location in Las Vegas that is...well, seemed a touch sketchy.  But we are there, so might as well have an adventure, right?!  No one is in the restaurant, and I'm thinking to myself 'that's not a good sign'.  The guy who welcomed us, the owner possibly (excuse me, can't remember his name, it is Vegas and I may or may not have been drinking since breakfast, resulting in memory loss concerning names), was super friendly.

Everyone ordered something different, and everyone liked their meals.  Definately worth going off the beaten path for this place.
