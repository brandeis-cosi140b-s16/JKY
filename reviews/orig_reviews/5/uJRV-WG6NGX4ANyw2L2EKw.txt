Amazing food, excellent service and a beautiful atmosphere. After terrible dining on father's day weekend in Sedona, it was a great change of pace to go somewhere that actually had great food! I have to say that the gal that refills your water and clears your plate is by far the best employee! She even boxed up our leftovers! We will definitely return!!
