Giving it a full constellation.  I do so love a hole in the wall,  and Dick's isn't much larger than that. ....literally. But,  wow,  the food.  Unbelievable.  Not the place to go for a salad,  mind you,  but fantastic grilled and Mexican dishes, cranked out by one guy in the tiniest of work spaces. Simplicity and complexity on the same plate.   Full bar,  happy hour specials.  My new go-to lunch spot when I'm headed to the airport.
