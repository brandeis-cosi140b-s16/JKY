So I was visiting some family in Phoenix and while I was here, I had a craving for some great Mexican food for lunch. I searched out this place on Yelp and it had decent reviews so I thought I'd hit it up. 

I was greeted warmly by the hostess who gave me the pick of the house for my preference and shortly after I was thanked and greeted by my server who offered a menu and drink request. I'm a total fanatic for good guacamole and carne asada so without even really looking at the menu, I ordered the guac appetizer and a carne asada burrito with jasmine rice.

I'm originally from San Diego and of course we're completely saturated with a billion Mexican restaurants both chain and privately owned so it's definitely not my first rodeo so to speak. When you travel to different parts of the country, you will see many different interpretations of what constitutes "Mexican Food" both good and bad unfortunately and some just "different".

When I got my food, I would say it's both "Different" AND "great"!!! The Guacamole had so many different flavors with some small chunks of Valencia Oranges and ripe Haas Avocados almost like a ceviche consistency. Delicious!!! When the burrito and rice arrived I took one bite and never wanted it to end. The meat was a well-seasoned rib eye steak that was so juicy and tender, I was so disappointed when it came to an end. 

The only thing that was better than the food was the service. Although I only ordered an Iced Tea, it's probably a good thing that I didn't order a margarita because the bus boy and server never let that glass get below half full before they were coming around the corner to refill it. Had it been a margarita, I would have been as sloshed as a boat captain of an Italian Cruise Ship in Greece!!

I've got nothing bad to say about my experience here and if you do dive into the drinks, there's a hotel right next door so you can sleep it off gently into a Cantina Coma!!!
