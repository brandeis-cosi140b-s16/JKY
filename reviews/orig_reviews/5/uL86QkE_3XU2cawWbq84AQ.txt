came here a couple weeks ago with my fianc√©, we got sat down right away (we beat the dinner rush) started us with happy hour - margaritas and the best bean dip and salsa. of course we killed right through those chips. he ordered the shrimp tacos and I ordered my favorite dish, chicken enchiladas with mole soooooo good! good ambience and great service, definitely will remember this place the next Time we go out for Mexican food.
