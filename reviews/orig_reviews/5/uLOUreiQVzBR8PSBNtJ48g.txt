I read a lot of good reviews on this place and I know a few people that have visted this restaurant and have loved it!

We went for lunch and the food is AMAZING! We didn't come in expecting too much, but was pleasantly surprised with the friendly and fast service.

We got the tableside guac - which was yummy! We  also ordered the beef empanadas and they were really good.

Our entrees were beef enchiladas and the carnitas street tacos. The quality of the food here is amazing! Our servers kept checking in on us and made the whole experience memorable.

Their drinks here are nice and stiff too if you opt to get a margarita ( pineapple).

They have 50% off for locals on Mondays - so check em' out! Their executive chef - Paco is super friendly! I wish more restaurants were like them! It is truly a gem!

DON'T FORGET TO GET THE FLAN! -- IT IS TO DIE FOR!
