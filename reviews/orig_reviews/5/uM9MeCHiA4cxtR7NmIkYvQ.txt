Nice place quiet polite and attentive service. I ordered the quesadilla combo which included rice, beans, grilled jalapeno, lime, regular drink (Free Refills) tortilla chips and a large quesadilla with a lot of carne asada. I paid like $7.50 good deal and hearty serving. The ladies were very nice and had my food ready in a matter of minutes. I had the red sauce which was not too spicy but subtle in flavor I liked it and I'm usually a green sauce kinda guy. I had gone in for the albondiga soup but decided on the quesadilla when I saw it. Ill be back for the soup soon.
