I love this place.
Awesome atmosphere, there was a guy playing guitar in the entrance.
The steaks are always good, good quality and they are served with a bunch of sides that are just delicious.
Big portions, you are def not gonna get out of there hungry.
Fair prices. 
Last time i went there i ordered the steak burracho, includes 2-3 sides and included in the price you get tortillas. All this for $18.
Service is phenomenal the waiters are always nice and the cips with salsa and bean sauce are just amazing :) 
If you end up in North Las Vegas do yourself a favor and stop there!
