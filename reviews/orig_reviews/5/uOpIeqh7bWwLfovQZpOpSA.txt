First time! These burgers are awesome! It's almost a shame to call them fast food. They offer gluten-free buns as well. They make their burgers fresh every day...that's fast food to brag about.

The chili chocolate shake is amazing. 

The young staff is friendly and helpful. Breath of fresh air 

I highly recommend this joint if you need something fast but good. This place is family owned. Buy local! Put your money back into your community.
