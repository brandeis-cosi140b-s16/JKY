Your token hole in the wall street food Mexican taco stand.  This place has cheap ($2 per taco!), authentic, soft corn tortillas with your choice of different meats which vary from steak, ground beef, chorizo, chicken, veggie, lengua.  Once you have your taco, there's an array of different sauces, cilantro, onion, and salsa that you can add to your taco.  The orange sauce was wayyyy beyond my spice tolerance, but I love drenching my tacos in the other sauces.
