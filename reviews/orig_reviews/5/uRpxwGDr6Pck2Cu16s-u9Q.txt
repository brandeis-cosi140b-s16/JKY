What a great find!! First off, the decor is really cool and modern. The staff was incredibly friendly and enthusiastic about the menu. And the food is fantastic. I had the Barbacoa tacos (4 of them). The meat was tender, and they came with a huge scoop of really good guac, a house-made potato chip and a grilled onion and jalape√±o. Nice touches. The cucumber lemonade alone is worth a return trip. All in all a great little spot and I can't wait to return.
