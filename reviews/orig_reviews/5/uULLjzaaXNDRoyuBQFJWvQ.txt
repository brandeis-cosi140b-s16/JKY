This is literally the best taco truck I've ever had! I came to visit a friend in Phoenix and we went here after a night of fun at Charlie's. Not only is the food amazing and full of flavor, but it's beyond reasonable. Tacos are only a $1.00 and oI don't remember anything being over $7.00. It was so good I went here twice during my visit to Phoenix. I tried the carne asada tacos, super nachos with asada, mini quesadilla with chicken and another one with carne asada. I think the quesadilla tastes best with asada. 

If you love authentic Mexican food, you must try Taqueria Los Yaquis!
