I can't believe I haven't taken the time to rave about this place. Fabulous grilled meats. Love the crazy potatoes with toppings. Tuesday Tacos night $1.25. The salsas are great. And if you like flan, order it as soon as you get there. It is homemade and they run out fast. Sometimes, I stop just for the flan. It is family owned. The prices are great and they give you a punch card which they trade for $5.00 off after 10 punches. The only drawback here is it is always crowded.
