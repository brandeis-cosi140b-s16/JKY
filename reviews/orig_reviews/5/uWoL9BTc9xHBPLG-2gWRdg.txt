Went for lunch this afternoon. As many awesome yelp reviews this place has gotten I'm really surprised it wasn't packed for lunch. We were literally the only people in the restaurant. 

First impressions...
Three Amigos is located in a small strip mall on Cental past the new McDonlads coming from uptown but before you get to the Eastway. When we walked in the waitress seated us immediately and took our drink orders and brought us chips and salsa. The restaurant decor is pretty cute a lot of colorful paintings. 

Food:
I ordered the chicken chimichanga and it was exactly as I pictured it. Perfect. It might just be a "me" thing but I really do prefer shredded chicken in my Mexican food compared to chunks. The chimichanga had just that. It was hot, fresh, crispy and delicious. Most of the lunch specials come with rice and beans like most Mexican restaurants. 

Service: VERY FRIENDLY!!!
Oh....and I had to do a double take at the price! Really only $5.95??? Umm... I think I should get out of uptown more often and drive down to Three Amigos!

One word: Authentic!
