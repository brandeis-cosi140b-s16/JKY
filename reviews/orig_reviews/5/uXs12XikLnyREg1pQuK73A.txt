Bomb bomb bomb food. The guy (I'm assuming the owner) was super nice/conversational and made sure to check in on us. Their food was amazing. The sausage breakfast burrito is a must. Also tried to the carne asada fries, which were delicious. I actually don't even usually like green salsa and theirs was still so good. I don't have one bad thing to say about this place!
