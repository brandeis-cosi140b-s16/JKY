If you want authentic tacos, this is the place to go. Both places (the other on E. Charleston) are delicious! I'm such a taco snob and this is the only place I go to, no matter how far I have to drive. I kind of wish they had burritos but as long as they keep making these awesome tacos it's all good! The only tacos better than these are the ones I get in Tijuana. 5 hours away...
