This is just my kind of place!!! It is hidden and dark and cozy. The food is ridiculously good... and this coming from a girl that doesn't really care for Mexican or New Mexican food!! It is the perfect place to take the men in your life. Guys always seem to love this hole in the wall gem. 

Often times there is a wait, as the place is small, but it is well worth it. More often than not we squeeze up to the bar to grab our brunch and end up making friends with everyone sitting around us. I think that is the #1 reason why I love this place... it reminds me of being back home in New Orleans!
