The al pastor is where it's at! Tender, moist and a bit spicy! I had both an al pastor taco and vampiro, and both were delicious! This was my first ever vampiro and I'm definitely a fan. For those of you who've never had one, it's two cripsy tortillas with meat and melty cheese inside, almost like a sandwich. I also had a carnitas taco and the street style corn- both very good. The salsa bar was also great with lots of options. Can't wait to come back!
