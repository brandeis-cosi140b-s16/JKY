I had been waiting so long to finally try out this restaurant. So when my mom said let's go, you know I was already waiting in the car. 
Walking in the place was very clean and the atmosphere was very chill. We were greeted right away and asked if we had ever been there before. The staff is very helpful and informative and even offered samples of any meat we wanted to try. I ordered the nachos with al pastor. WOW for a small it still came with a lot on it. The chips were nice and crispy and on top it came with shredded cheese, your choice or black/pinto beans and meat, pico de gallo, sour cream, avocado cream and guacamole. It was delicious!!! I was very pleased and the salsa selection was great!!! I was not at all disappointed and I highly recommend it. I will definitely become a regular here!!
