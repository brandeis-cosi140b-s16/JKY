Unbelievably amazing!!!i absolutely love everything about tho place. Let's start with customer service, everyone one there is so nice they let you sample the juices even suggest juices to mix. It feels good to walk in and be recognized and they already know what you are going to order. The food is fresh, cooked to order, perfect amount of seasoning and ingredients. It was so good my boyfriend and I went 4 times in a row with 2 times being in the same day ( I pride myself on knowing good food) my favorite items on the menu would have to be the carne asada quesadilla, and the shrimp salad. My first time eating a salad and not noticing that I didn't put any dressing on it ( just delicious) but the dressing they have is delicious as well. The spinach drink is my fav and sometime I mix spinach with pineapple for more sweetness. And don't worry if you show to the restaurant 10 minutes before closing you still will receive excellent customer services and fresh food unlike other places where you feel like you are an inconvenience and you get the scrappy food.... I cannot rave about this place enough !!!!
