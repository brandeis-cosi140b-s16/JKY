I rarely give 5 stars to a restaurant.  In fact I've been on a 1 and 2 star rampage lately in this lil ol' town of Surprise.  Ritos, however, gets the job done and they are masters of their craft.  The menu isn't as extensive as other mexican restaurants, but thats what makes it great.  I've yet to eat anything at any other mexican restaurant in Surprise that I like.  They stick to what they know, and they know how to make some great homemade food.  Just order the green chili burrito enchilada style with red sauce and you will understand what I'm talking about.  Im pretty sure thats their number one seller, and for a damn good reason.  All of their food is good, but the green chili burrito traditional style is something I would request as my last meal on Earth.  Its that good.  Keep up the great work, and thank you so very much for serving up some great food in a city that really needs to up its game in the restaurant area.
