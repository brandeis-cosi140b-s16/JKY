This was the best dinner I have ever had. My husband and I dined here on our wedding day, and from the moment we arrived we felt like special guests. After having a drink at the bar, we were seated in a beautiful room by the fire place. We had the room to ourselves! I can't say enough about the food here. I've been here before and my dinner was superb. Our waiter, Julio, made food and drink recommendations and really made our experience even more amazing. From the table side guacamole to the mojitos with tequila to filets, pork carnitas and lobster tacos this was a meal to remember. We will be back! - and the tres leches  cake is to die for.  The staff here will make your dinner such a great experience.
