We had an amazing experience at this quaint restaurant.  It was a beautiful day to sit on their patio.  We had great margaritas in mason jars and great wine too!  The chips and dip were wonderful.  The salsa is a bit spicy, but we loved it!  Food was well above average for a Mexican joint.  Atmosphere is the best part of the place.  We would go back in a heartbeat!
