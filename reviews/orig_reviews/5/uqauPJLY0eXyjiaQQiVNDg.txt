Popped in on a Friday night after striking out at Crisp and 7th Street Market. My roommate had stopped in here for lunch one day and brought me the leftovers. I was already impressed with their chicken quesadilla ( I know, I know, chicken quesadillas seem so simple, but they are a favorite of mine, and Sabor Latin Street Grill were on point in their recipe) and was excited to try something else from the menu. I ended up ordering a salad and while I waited, I checked out the restaurant. It's a large room with some tables and booths, different bottled beer available to purchase. The workers were really nice and my food didn't take long at all. My salad was DELISH! It was huge, and reasonably priced ( 8 bones and some change). Super fresh ingredients, and I am not sure what it is, but their flour tortillas were so tasty. I will definitely be back and plan on covering all of the menu. Welcome to the hood, Sabor Latin Street Grill!
