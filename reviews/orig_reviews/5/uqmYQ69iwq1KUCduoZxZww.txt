WELL WORTH THE DRIVE FROM THE STRIP! This place keeps amazing me, their tacos are all to die for! They have a new must try... fried chicken taco with mashed potatoes and a chorizo sauce (Xavier recommended and he was not wrong). Don't forget the GUAC, you'll love it! Also don't forget to ask to sit in Xaviers section, he's awesome. Truly one of the best servers!!! Thank you for always making it a great time!
