This has been a family favorite of ours for years and years.  The only entree we ever get are the family-style fajitas.  I'm sure the rest of their food is great, but their fajitas are the best we've ever had!  They come out sizzling on a hot cast-iron plate with sauteed onions peppers, and are served alongside homemade flour tortillas.  You can't get any better than that!  Great, now my mouth is watering....
