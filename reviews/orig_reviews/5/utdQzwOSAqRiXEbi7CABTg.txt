5 STARS!!!  Love this place.  I have to drive to get there but happily make the trip.  The fajitas are the best in town.  The condiments that go along with it are generous (grilled onions, peppers, avocado, pico, sour cream.  You get a choice of either corn or flour tortillas.   They also bring out an interesting cup of soup before the meal.  They also bring out hot bean dip and salsa and chips before the meal which is one of my favorite things about this place.   Juan, the owner is often there and working his butt off.  I wish they would open another location (ie. Summerlin would be awesome!!  (Juan, if you are listening).  What else to say about this place?  Everyone is friendly...service is great!!!! I love everything about this place.
