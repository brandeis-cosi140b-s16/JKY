I have been going to this place since I attended ASU in 1971.  At the time they were located almost on the NW corner of Mill and University.  They have moved at least 3 times since then as the city has razed old buildings for new.  Any place that has been around that long has to be 5 stars, and Restaurant Mexico definitely is IMHO.  In fact, a few of the servers have been there since I found the place.

The food has never changed in all these years, not one tiny slip of quality or flavor.  It is quite different that most Mexican food places, in fact I've never found another like it.  I believe the food is of the Mexico City region.  The variety of Mexican food available to us in the Valley is amazing and I believe everyone should visit this place often enough to try everything on the menu.  We all have our preferences and I'm sure you will find a favorite here that will addict you to returning time after time.

Be sure to try the Chili Rellenos, which are only available on Fridays if you can get in before they run out.  They are made the real way, not just a folded omelette with a chili inside.  Check out the Beef and Avocado Tostada (Salpicon), and the Soup de Olla (soup style beans).

The service is always the best, although I have read a couple of reviews where that disappointed.  Some customers are miserable and not to be dealt with, and of course something could have happened one day.  A servers sudden absence, server having a general bad day.  Not sure what happened but I have never in 40 some years had that happen to me.
