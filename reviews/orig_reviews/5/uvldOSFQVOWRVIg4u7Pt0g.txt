This restaurant is definitely a local's favorite with the best view of the city in town! I recommend the steak Ranchero and Chile Colorado however I do not think you can go wrong with their menu! The only downfall to our last experience was that the wait was nearly 45 minutes but the bar was more than accommodating. So with that being said, I would definitely recommend calling to make a reservation prior to your visit!
