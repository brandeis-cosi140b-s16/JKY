The Biscuits on Dobson was just way too crowded and annoying the other day, so we swung in here for a breakfast burrito.  Not our usual location, but the great quality of the bacon breakfast burrito was the same as we are used to.  Those things are addictive!  They were very busy and had two registers going with two friendly employees.  As the bumper stickers say, "I heart Los Favs!"
