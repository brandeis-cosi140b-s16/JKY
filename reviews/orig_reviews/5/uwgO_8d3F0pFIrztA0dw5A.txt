In 2012, I found this jewel of a restaurant while on a business trip.  This year, my wife and I were there within a hour of landing in Phoenix.  We did have a wait for a table but they were gracious and offered to call my cell phone so we could enjoy Ole Scottsdale area while the sun was setting.

We selected a table outside in the rear patio.  It was slightly chilly so they brought my wife a blanket.  Who would have thought Phoenix would have been so chilly...in mid April.

We love their guacamole made table side.  That was our favorite.  Amanda was our server and she made several great selections.  Although the portions are small, we feel like this is going to be on the list for 2014.  

BTW - the salsa is fantastic!
