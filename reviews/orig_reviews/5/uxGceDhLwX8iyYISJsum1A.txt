I love this place!  I've been eating here for several years, from when I worked at the health dept and it was right out the back door.  It's in kind of a weird neighborhood just west of the projects, but not too horrible.  The ceviche is excellent, but my favorite by far is the Viagra Soup (yes, it really is called that) which is out of this world!
