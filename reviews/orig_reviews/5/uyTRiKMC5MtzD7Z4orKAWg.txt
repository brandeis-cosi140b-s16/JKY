Husband loved his asada burrito.  Lots of tender meat and perfect spice.  One of his new favorite places for burrito.  Cant go wrong with the street tacos or corn chips and guacamole either.  Go on 1.00$ taco Tuesday and get a great value.  We don't just handout five stars to every place we eat.  This place is good!
