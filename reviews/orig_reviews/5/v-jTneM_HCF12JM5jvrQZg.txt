One of the best Mexican restaurants in the Valley. Simple, authentic dishes prepared with ultra-fresh ingredients. The salsas are wonderful. 

Another plus is the band in the dining room. Don't let the exterior put you off.  Plan for some time either before or after your meal to take in the local atmosphere of Old Town Scottsdale, all within walking distance.
