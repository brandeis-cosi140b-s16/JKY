Best chips and salsa I have had in a long time! Super cute decor. I had the shredded chicken burrito and it was packed with yummy yummy chicken. We also ordered a cantaloupe drink that was very refreshing. Service was very efficient and good. We had no problems with our meal. We will definitely be back.
