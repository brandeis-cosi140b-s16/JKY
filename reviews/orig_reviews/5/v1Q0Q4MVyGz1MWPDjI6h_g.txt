I love Emilianos! I have yet to be disappointed there. Service here is always very friendly and quick. Tableside guac is always exceptional as well as the queso fundido. Regular queso is also just as yummy! Who doesn't love cheese?! 

I usually will stick to Arroz con pollo which never lets me down. Always perfectly made and comes out super quick. If I feel like dessert I will order the Tres Leches Cake which is simple phenomenal. I am usually a big chocolate girl, but this cake is unlike any other cake or dessert I have had. Sweet and creamy!
