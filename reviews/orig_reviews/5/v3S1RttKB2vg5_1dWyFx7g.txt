Visiting from out of town and wanted a nice sit down Mexican meal. This place delivered! Moderately priced as well! Everyone loved their food, hubby loved fish tacos, mom raved about the steak ranchero. Not super crowded or loud either which is nice. Lots of comfy booths or tables & chairs. They bring you fideo soup complimentary and chips and salsa and bean dip! Thank you for a great Sunday lunch!! Will return when we come back to Vegas!
