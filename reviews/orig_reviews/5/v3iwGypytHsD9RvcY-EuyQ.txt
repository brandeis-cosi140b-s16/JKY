This place is great. I've lived in AZ for 10 years now, and this is probably the best mexican food I've had in the valley. El Bravo, I'd describe as a dive restaurant. It's one of those places where you walk in for the first time and wonder if you should turn right back around and walk out. Don't make that mistake. It's definitely not going to win any awards for decor/atmosphere, but if you want great mexican, this is the place to go.

The service has been very good to date, and the family is always friendly, as you can tell they appreciate their customers. Keep it up El Bravo!
