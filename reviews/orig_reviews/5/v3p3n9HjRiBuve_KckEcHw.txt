One a short day trip to Scottsdale, we found Los Olivos Restaurant. Without knowing its history or menu, we ventured in and we're pleasantly surprised. The food was excellent and authentic. We had the tacos and the tamales. The tamales were incredibly flavorful.  The prices were reasonable. This is a perfect Mexican restaurant for a date, family gathering, or intimate night out with friends...not flashy but very friendly (family-owned).
