We stumbled upon this place while checking out the architectural wonder of  Luxor.  We sat at the bar and soon learned that it was happy hour! I had a drink called the chonga which is a frozen margarita with a beer sticking out of it. Yum! Our bartender was very knowledgeable and friendly. She informed us that all of the margaritas are made with fresh juices and they don't use sour mix or triple sec. I don't mind paying a little more for a quality product. The food was very good. We ordered a bunch of small plates and they were only 5 bucks each during happy hour. My favorite was the guacamole.
