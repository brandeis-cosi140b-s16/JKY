Food - 2/2
*I've eaten here multiple times and I've never had anything I don't like.  The tacos (all of them) are excellent.  My favorites are the skirt steak, tanked up and shake down shrimp.  But my personal favorite menu item is the mac and cheese.  It a delightful Texas style mac/cheese that has a kick to it. It's creamy and delicious!  My go-to upscale Tex-Mex restaurant in South Charlotte.

Service - 1/1
*No complaints here.  Friendly, helpful.  Nothing extraordinary, but solid.

Price - 0.5/1
*A little higher than I'd like to pay, but that's what you have to expect in Southpark.  Let's be serious though - $9 for guacamole is outrageous.

Atmosphere - 1/1
*Fun place to have dinner.  Packed on the weekends, but if if's packed, you can still walk around different shops and they'll call you when you table is ready. One night I found a table in the bar area, while it was crowded, and still had a great time. 

Listen, all of Frank Scibelli's restaurants (Mama Ricotta's, Cantina 1511, Bad Daddy's Burger Bar, Midwood Smokehouse, and Paco's Tacos & Tequila) are 5/5.  I've come to like this place better than Cantina 1511.  It's the best place to have tacos in the city.
