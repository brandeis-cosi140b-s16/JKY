Such an amazing meal. Super fresh ingredients, all made to perfection. My sons ordered off the kids meal and ate everything.! The children's menu items come with aqua fresca and churros. Don't miss the fresh guacamole- made at your table. The chicken enchiladas were big enough to share. Our waiter, Rorke, was awesome and recommended we not miss dessert- so true! My husband had the fried ice cream, I had the flan, and the kids had the churros. Every dessert was perfect! Chef Paco came to our table and was as sweet as could be. We will return here as soon as we can and tell friends to not miss this stop!
