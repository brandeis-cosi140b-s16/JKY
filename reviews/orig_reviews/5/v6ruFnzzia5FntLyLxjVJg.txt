Awesome meat.
Most of my buddies got the ribs, which are wicked spicy. They were sweating! Their ribs are already off the bone so I guess that speaks to how tender they are.
I like milder food and found the tender pork (carnitas) delicious! It was the rice that was spicy! Great food.
Go there for birthdays! They have a great way to celebrate!
Also Kick-ass margaritas are really kick ass! Pitchers all around!
