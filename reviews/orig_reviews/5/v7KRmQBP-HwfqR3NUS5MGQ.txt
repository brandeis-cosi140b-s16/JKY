Best place to go to at Desert Ridge marketplace! Went in for some lunch and drinks and it was actually pretty cheap. Lunch specials were great and good portions. I had a frozen margarita which was awesome! The bartender even said they had a bunch of different flavors of margaritas to try! My friend had a glass of sangria which was delicious too! If I ever go shopping in this area again I will definitely stop in again!
