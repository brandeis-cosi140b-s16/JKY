Ok, ok,ok, I came back. I've decided to put the last encounter there behind me. While I'm still not pleased about it. This last visit is exactly what I expected from this business. 

Seeing the google offer for Las Velas and having it literally right next door to work was too good to pass up. Not to mention the offer IS good for alcohol as well as food anytime after 4pm, INCLUDING happy hour. It doesn't get any better than that. 

As soon as I walked up to the bar I was greeted by not one but TWO employees. I had a water while I waited for happy hour to start. The waitstaff stands next to the end of the bar where I was sitting while waiting for tables and drink orders to be completed. Small talk was made and it was pleasant.

The margaritas were strong as always. The air was light and cheerful. None of the anxiety driven rush rush rush of my last visit. We had cheese with salsa and fresh made guac. They were a great addition to the drinks. We got so much for the 30$ offer. I'd still love to try a meal here one night after work, as I've yet to try any actual entrees. 

My only advice is that if you have the google offer to print it out before hand. While you don't have to, I did have to go into the office and log into my google on their office computer to print it out there.
