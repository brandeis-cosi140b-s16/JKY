If I could give this please more starts I easily would. My friends and I went here as suggested our friend who lives in Vegas and let me tell you I will always listen to him for his food recommendations. This place was so yummy and had a cool vibe to it. Very clean and our server Eva was awesome. Very personable and knew the menu well. We all got nachos myself the ones with the pulled BBQ pork and white cheddar and cilantro. My mouth is watering just thinking about them. I definitely recommend them. My husband got the hamburger nachos and those were very yummy. One of our friends got the tacos and man oh man was the tortilla delish. House made by the chef himself and the best thing we had ever tried. We tried asking for the recipe but they wouldn't share their secret recipe. Although Eva told us they were in the process of creating a cook book and to look for it in May! Man I can't wait til May so I can be one of the firsts in line to purchase all the yummy dishes. Thank you Nacho Daddy and Eva we had a wonderful time.
