I thank the guy at the Radisson hotel front desk  who directed us to this place. He sends all his outsider guests who are looking for authentic finger licking Mexican food to Mi Patio.

You cannot beat the $3 Margarita specials so my friend and I ordered two glasses each. To top it off, our waiter gave us Kamikaze shots on the house. Such a cute kid he was. How beautful is that? 

While waiting for my  huge-ass veggie burrito, I discovered that  tortilla chips and home made salsa went absolutely well with my margarita! Another good marriage,  I say.
 
Portions are luxurious, surely enough to make you fat. 
Service was great! (speedy) 

The next time I am in town, I'm coming back to eat like a Mexican!
