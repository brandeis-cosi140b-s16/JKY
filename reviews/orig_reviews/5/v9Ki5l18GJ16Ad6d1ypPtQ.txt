As I read the negative reviews for Escobar's, I wonder if the reviewers are too young to have had experiences in great restaurants, are just used to chain-restaurant food, have no sense of style, are picky eaters, or are just socially inept. Escobar's is a gem. I consider it one of the finest restaurants in the area. Escobar is extremely knowledgable and creative in his presentations of Central American cuisine, and the prices are half of what you would expect to pay if you read the menu without the prices.

I've eaten here dozens of times, both lunch and dinner. I've never had a bad experience with either the food or the service. House baked rolls or muffins, sometimes sweet, sometimes savory are delivered to your table first off. Then there are several specials of the day. The service has always been prompt and attentive, whether I have eaten alone or in a group of up to twenty people. The first time I had the roast chicken with mole, I was floored. It's very difficult to roast a chicken and have the light and dark meat be perfectly cooked. Escobar's does this, and the mole sauce is spectacular.

For lunch I tend toward the sandwiches. The shrimp po' boy (which I order on Cuban bread) is excellent, with black bean corn relish and herb aioli. The Guatemalan Torta is a perfect blend of ingredients. I can't recommend this restaurant highly enough. Better hurry, though...Escobar's lease is up in January 2017, and he's decided to end the business unless he gets a sale offer. That's a pity.
