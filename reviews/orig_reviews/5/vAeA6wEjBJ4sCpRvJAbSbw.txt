This place is a lifesaver for Phoenix Mexican food.  I've tried and tried to find "good" Sonoran style Mexican food and am always disappointed by a greasy mess, up until I stumbled upon ATS.  

The people that work here are very sweet and the decor is charming.  I would describe it as a kind of surf shop meets diner decor.  It is in a cute older house on 7th, well maintained and colorfully adorned with artsy knickknacks and brickabrack and such.

The food is very cheap and very simple, you can tell that love goes into every dish.  A bean burrito is $3.25 and very filling.  The been and cheese concoction that fills it is very tasty but not overly greasy, much unlike many of the other lauded burrito places in town.  The veggie quesadilla was delicious as well, kind of crunchy from the cabbage or something that is inside.  Both were served with some traditional accoutrement and homemade, wonderful salsa.  

The jewel of my meal here was the white corn on the cob.  Not really knowing what I was ordering at first, I was a little doubtful, but really wanted something more veggie like to round out the meal.  What came was the most wonderful ear of corn I have ever eaten.  The cob is a sweet white corn which is then slathered in a slim coat of mayo and dipped in what I think was parmesean cheese (but was probably the Sonoran equivalent).  This was served with lime and a chili sauce that was sweet and spicy and out of this world when doused on the corn.

What a great little place in a wonderful neighborhood (maybe my favorite) of central Phoenix.  If you feel let down by the Mexican food that has covered this valley in a layer of tasteless grease, go here before giving up (also go to Mucho Gusto in Tempe, ATS is the cheaper option).
