Had seen good reviews here on Yelp, so decided to give it a try before heading out to the fair.  I was not disappointed.  I knew it was going to be good as soon as I walked in the door.  Not only was the food absolutely delicious, but the service was outstanding.  Our server was very attentive, salsa was refilled without asking, and not only were the drinks never empty, but plenty of ice in my iced tea.  Although the ice may sound like a minor thing to some, it scores big on my ratings.

The menu has all of the traditional offerings at an affordable price.

Although I live in Buckeye, I will definitely make the trip and come back again.
