It scares me how close this place is to my house. Food is epic every time. Glad they have carne asada now as well.

The chimichangas as so good and crispy when fresh. Salsa and chips are a must every time as well. You cannot go wrong with this place I promise. It will be jam packed just like it always is so be prepared to wait and stake your claim at the first open table you can find.
