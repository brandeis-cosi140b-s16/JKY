For more of a "gourmet" Mexican type of restaurant, this place was very good.  My husband and I had arrived into Vegas this past friday night and after checking into the Encore, we headed over to Treasure Island with the intent to have dinner at Gilley's BBQ and just stay there to dance all night. 

Well Gilley's was packed and it was clear finding a place to sit so you could eat wasn't in the cards- so we stumbled upon ISLA.  We were seated right away.  Service was wonderful.  We ordered our Margaritas and chips/salsa with a side of queso at $4- but it was YUMMY!  My husband had the ceviche for appetizer and I had the corn soup- both were deilsh!!  Then for our entrees,  I ordered the skirt steak volcano and my husband ordered the grilled salmon.    The steak presentation was amazing- it looked like a volcano with layers of steak, tomatoes and onions. .  The meat was perfectly cooked and very lean.    My husband said that his Salmon was grilled perfectly  Earlier this week we had gone to a function held at a local restaurant and he said "the best grilled salmon ever" after that night and after ISLA- he said he couldn't believe that twice in one week at two separate places, he had the best grilled salmon he had ever had.

We passed on dessert- we were way too full and wanted to get moving and go onto dancing!   All in all, a great experience!
