So I should have written this review about 2 years ago, but better late than never? Yes this place is tiny in a strip mall, but the hidden places tend to be the best! 
Like previous YELPERS, I am in love with the owner Celina is a firecracker! I was not in the restaurant for a few months since I moved out of the are, but she recognized my mother and I right away and wondered where we had been! We were able to chat for awhile after the lunch rush was calmed down. She goes and get all the fresh ingredients every morning at 0630. The carne asada is cooked over a mesquite grill and all of the ingredients are so fresh you would think they were picked fresh from a farm. There is NO freezer, that's how fresh the food is. Celina takes quality to the next level in a little pace lie this. There can be a wait for your food, but please it is worth it and quality takes time- if you want fast go to Taco Bell. 
I was showing Celina YELP on my phone. She was so happy that her restaurant has been rated so highly. She told me the story about wondering who Mr. Yelp was and how he knew so many people! We may have a new YELPER on our hands with Celina. 
I did try a repasado for the first time strawberry with ice cream on top- pretty amazing and now on top of my combo plate a repasado will be in my order as well- again Celina makes these fresh! 
Please if you are looking for AMAZING food and a welcoming environment head to Sonora Mesquite Grill- and tell Celina Mr YELP sent you!
