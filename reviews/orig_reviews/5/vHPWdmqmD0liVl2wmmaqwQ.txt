A Los Tacos carne asada burrito (no crema, no queso, with aguacate) is my silver bullet against any hangover. When ordering, be sure to request a side of cebollitas; it's a charred mix of green onions, fiery serranos and mild but flavorful white-ish pepper things -- No idea what they are. Just eat em! I judge all the fools at the Del Taco a couple buildings down so hard.
