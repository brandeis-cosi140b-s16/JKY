I was pretty skeptical of a restaurant right next to a strip club but this place is amazing. The food is so good and for being certified non GMO it's actually very reasonably priced. 
I had the jalape√±o margarita and the carne asada plate... Both are must try's in my opinion!!!
The staff was so friendly and knowledgable and I loved Sean the manager. He came by our table, awesome guy. 
Highly recommend this place !!!
