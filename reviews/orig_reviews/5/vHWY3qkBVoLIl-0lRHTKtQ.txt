This was our first stop in Phoenix and it was so great!

The indoor & outdoor decor is so quaint and cool--there's so much to see. The outdoor patio is super charming and even has misters.

I had my first Chimichanga here and it was sooo good and sooo spicy. I chose the Shredded Beef one with Green Chili and it was just great. So much flavor in every bite, super savory.

Service was super friendly and the music was loud but good.

I'll definitely be back next time I'm in town!
