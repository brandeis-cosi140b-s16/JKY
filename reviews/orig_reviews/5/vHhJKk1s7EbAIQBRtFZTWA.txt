I think I have to give this place the nod as my favorite restaurant in Phoenix.  The food is fantastic, good service, good atmosphere, it's perfect.  

I've had the Rokerij steak twice, it's perfect.  The dungeness crab is plentiful and melts in your mouth alongside the delicious fillet.  I'm more of a meat and potatoes kind of guy and I even crave the vegetables here, they are so fresh and tasty.  I've also had the sea bass on one occasion and that was equally wonderful.  The only thing that could maybe have been better was if our server (on one occasion) was a little more knowledgeable about the wine list.  It's big, I'll give her that, but she wasn't familiar with many of the bottles on the reserve list.  We received great service though, so I can't fault them there.  

This is my go to for a great meal or special occasion.

Reserving a table through opentable/yelp app was extremely easy and accurate, walked and was seated right away.
