I can remember when this location was being built as a kid, little did I know that one day this place would make the best pollo fundido on the planet.  That's right, second to none and it took me many years to discover this wonderful treat of a meal.  I have been here many times over the years since I literally grew up with the smell since I lived right across the street from here.  The chips and salsa are so good here as well, the spicy hot sauce is the best!  All the meals here are large portioned and always delish, the atmosphere is very nice for the area and the bar is a cool place to hang out as well.  I love the different elevations throughout the restaurant.  The service is always 5 star as well, I highly recommend a visit here if you are looking for AZ Mexican food.
