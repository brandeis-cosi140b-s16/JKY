Been to Fuego CityScape a few times now and both were great.  Southwest Meatloaf sliders rocked!  Also have tried the Empenadas and they were delicious.  My co-worker usually gets the Cubano sandwich which he says is top notch.  Yes, the space is a little awkward, but you go in, sit down and eat...not sure what other reviewers are looking for.  Service has been freindly and helpful during my visits.  Keep it up Fuego!
