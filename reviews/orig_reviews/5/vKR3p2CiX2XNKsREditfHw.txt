I loved the atmosphere and the great customer service. We had tacos asada and whipped fruit drinks. 
The tacos were delicious.  Fresh tomatoes,  onions, avocados,  salsa and meat seasoned to perfection. 
We went in and had to ask for help placing an order.  Slightly confusing at first. There were 5 ordering stations. Each station had a cook preparing your food to order. The drinks are unlimited and tasty. The whipped drinks were tasty.
The seating is outside under a covered canopy. There were two attendants under the canopy.
