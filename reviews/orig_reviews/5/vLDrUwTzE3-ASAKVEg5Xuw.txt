My husband and I are locals and come to Jalapeño Inferno frequently, but just today our excellent server, Cyvanah, shared with us about yelp. We travel a lot and have never used yelp but after she told us we immediately went home and checked it out. 

We have never had a bad experience at Jalapeño Inferno, just today my husband and I sat on the beautiful patio. He had some enchiladas with an ice cold beer, and I had a salad with a top shelf margarita, everything was outstanding as usual. 

We recommend this Mexican food to everyone we know and have never heard a complaint back. It is most certainly a place to spend your time. Food, drinks, service, they offer it all!
