Thanks to the closing of the Strip location....the North Las Vegas Tacos El Gordo opening has finally come!  Nothing gets better than $2 tacos! All the food is the same quality as the old Strip and Charleston location.  There is limited seating, so be prepared to stalk the tables if you plan on eating here.  My favorites are still the adobada (spicy pork) tacos...make sure you ask for pineapple with it!  The adobada tacos have the avocado/sour cream sauce that helps balance out the spicy red sauce.  My second favorite are the carne asada (steak) tacos, which have a nice charred flavor and comes with cilantro/onions/and avocado.  I've also tried the suadero, but the meat is just a little dry for me. I would prefer the lengua (beef tongue) over the suadero (beef breast).  If you like a little side of grilled veggies, you can ask for the grilled onions/peppers as well. I haven't been adventurous enough to try the cabeza (brains), beef stomach, and tripe yet...but one day.  I love that the drinks here have free refills....that means I can drink horchata all day =P.
