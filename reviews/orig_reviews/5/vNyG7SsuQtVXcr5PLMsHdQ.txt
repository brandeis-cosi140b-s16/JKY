If you live in Phoenix and you have never been to this place, shame on you.  You have been missing out.  My husband and I were in PHX for a short vacay and after standing in the Hertz rental car line for 40 freaking minutes, I told him we are not going to Chino Bandido but the closest Mexican restaurant we can find on Yelp with the highest ratings.  Lo' and behold, it was Mariscos Playa Hermosa!  Literally 2 miles from the airport and easy to find.  

We are so glad that we were able to find the best Mexican food we've ever had while in PHX, but it was hard having this as our first meal of the trip.  Every meal after this was just not cutting it.  Therefore, we planned the last day of our trip around the fact that Mariscos Playa Hermosa closed at 8pm on Sundays. 

You really can't go wrong with the menu.  The first time, I ordered Fish Enchiladas and my husband ordered the Garlic Fish platter.  Both were amazing.  Their complimentary ceviche tostada was also delicious, as well as their salsas.   The 2nd time we went, I ordered the Camarones Culichi and my husband ordered another fish dish w/ vegetables.  Both were amazing again.  However, if you go here I would highly recommend the Camarones Culichi.....just because it's not something you find  at any mexican restaurant.  It was so delicious that I licked the plate of sauce clean after eating all of the shrimp, and I don't care how uncouth that might have looked because you will probably end up doing the same.  (Now, if you cannot handle spicy foods, you may want to be very cautious.  Maybe order an Horchata drink to go with the meal, or a side of sour cream to buffer the spiciness.)  Anyway, I don't want to hype it up too much or you might be disappointed.
