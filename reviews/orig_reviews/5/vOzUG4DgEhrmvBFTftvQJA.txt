We've been to Blue Adobe 4 times and each time was great!!  So far we've loved every item that we've had.  And we've ordered different items each time.  Last night the staff was excellent even though it got busy half way through our dinner.  We ate at the bar which has a hammered copper top (We really like it).  I will say the best place to eat in the restaurant is at the bar.  There are usually only 2 of us and we can be seated immediately.  Be aware that each time we've gone they have been busy which says a lot about the food, which I reiterate, is wonderful.  Don't expect traditional Mexican from here.  The menu is very creative.  Vicki the owner was charming and our bartender Laurie was great!  We definately recommend Blue Adobe and will have future fun times there.
