Came here with a party of 14 during their anniversary week and the place was crazy. I have to say they could not have done a better job considering the situation. I've been before when things weren't so crazy and the service was good but I must say they rose to the occasion! This place has some seriously yummy food and great drinks! Don't let the prices scare you, the quality is there.
