Can't believe I haven't reviewed this place yet. I love this spot! The food is great, the dining vibe is perfect (think cozy wine cellar) and all the staff are friendly. I mostly have visited for lunch, so prices are decent. Not sure how the dinner prices compare. 

Tip: Stay away from he fresh bread... It is sinfully delicious, and you will not have willpower to leave room in your stomach for entrees (and they are worth it!)
