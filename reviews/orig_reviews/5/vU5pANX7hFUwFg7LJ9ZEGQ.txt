We went for dinner last night and I will definitely be back! We had to wait for about 30 min for a table but we were able to get drinks at the bar. During this time we also got to chat with the owner, such a nice guy. 

We finally were seated. We ordered margaritas, guac, queso with chorizo and an assortment of tacos. Everything was delicious! I had the fish taco and would highly recommend it. Very reasonably priced too. 

I also really like the vibe and atmosphere! I hope this place can survive in Dilworth, it is a great addition.
