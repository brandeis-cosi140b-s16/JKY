We stopped at this place while on road trip because who doesn't love Mexican food? 

Immediately when we entered it was a very clean establishment with cute western decor. My friends and I were greeted with nothing but "Hello's" and warm smiles. As soon as we sat down, we were immediately brought complimentary fresh warm tortilla chips and 3 types of dips of our choosing (I recommend the "spicy" red salsa and bean dip) by the bus boy and a wonderful waitress with blonde hair (I wish I remembered her name) greeted us so happily and took our drink order. The horchata was good and luckily they have micheladas for our friend who was hung over!. 

Being from Southern California I know good Mexican food quality, so we ordered their guacamole which was real fresh guacamole (thank god!) and it tasted excellent with our chips. I ordered the Horitos (bacon wrapped mild yellow chiles stuff w shrimp) which was AMAZING. They were so good that I came back home and attempted to make them myself. My 2 friends ordered the flautas plate and was very satisfied with their meal as well. Overall presentation of the food and taste was high quality. 

This place is a mexican/tex mex style and overall the food was great but what really stood out was the outstanding customer service that was brought by the staff (including the owner herself). They made us feel welcomed and you could tell off the bat that they genuinely loved their job which is very rare to see and exhibit through customer service nowadays. 

If I'm ever in the area again I am definitely going back and would recommended this place to anyone who values great food and service!
