I had eaten at the Border Grill near the Mandalay Bay Hotel and loved it.  We had a wonderful dinner at this restaurant, too.  Our server was so helpful and sweet.  She brought us additional items to try along with our dinner.  We were surprised by the complimentary  desserts.  We received free margaritas for check in on Yelp.  I loved the plantains.  The guacamole and chips were wonderful.  We will definitely return.
