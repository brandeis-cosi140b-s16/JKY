I have eaten at this Lindo about 5 times.  I have never been disappointed.  I usually order the Pollo Sarandeados with flour tortillas.  It is always good.  I cut up the chicken, put it in the flour tortillas with some guac, rice, and salsa - it is awesome.  The chips are always good.  The bean dip is spot on - good flavor and always warm.  I tried my daughter's quesadilla this time -  she loved it and I thought it had a good flavor.  
The atmosphere is inviting - large and spacious.  The service is always friendly.  And, they had the basketball game on tonight - bonus.  
I will continue to return.  This is a great place for dinner.
