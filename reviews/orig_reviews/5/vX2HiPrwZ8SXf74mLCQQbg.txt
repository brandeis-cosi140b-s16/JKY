Quality food, presented beautifully, in a very clean restaurant.  Awesome cucumber drink, a must try. The rib eye is a must to try, fabulous flavor, love it on the tostada, with beans and delish cheese, wish I didn't tear into it before I took this picture.  Lol  Fish tacos have great quality piece of fish, they just need to make sure oil is fresh.  Employees are wonderful, very sweet, helpful and attentive.
