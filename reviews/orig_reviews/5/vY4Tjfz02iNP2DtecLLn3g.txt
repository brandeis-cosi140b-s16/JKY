My current favorite taco place on planet earth.

There's something about a finely crafted taco. All of their meat is hot and delicious. It comes straight from the grill onto your plate, so you know that it's good. The carne asada has this smoky flavor that is so unlike anything else I've ever had. Tacos Al Pastor are my hands down favorite and you need to get them with everything on top, including the pineapple which sits at the top of the spit. You'll want to make sure that you get some grilled onions and peppers to complete the experience. If there's a line, get in it as soon as you can because this place is worth the wait, and the drive.
