Pretty much what everyone else said.  Excellent food, cheap prices, no-frills atmosphere.  Easily the best tacos I have had here in AZ, perhaps CA also.  They use good ingredients, high quality meat, excellent corn tortillas.  I didn't try to go during lunch when school is in session, I could imagine it would be a nightmare being right across the street from a High School.
