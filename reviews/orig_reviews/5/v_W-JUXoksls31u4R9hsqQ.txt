Excellent food and causual atmosphere.  We visited as a group of three from Portland, OR.  We enjoyed the Quesadilla, Poblano Chili's, Tomato Salad, Pulled Pork, Tamales, and Margaritas.  The service was excellent and the food was delectable.   
A friend in Portland referred me and I'm glad she did.
