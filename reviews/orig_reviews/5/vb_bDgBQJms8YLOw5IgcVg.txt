YUM!
So glad I made the decision to give this place a try.  Tasty, satisfying, fresh, reasonably priced, and a couple of really great guys behind the counter.  Theses two are providing guidance and info about the food, directing to the best place for menu viewing, taking the orders, and cooking it up to order.
Did I say FRESH?  The fish was fresh and tasty and the light batter was very complimentary, not a lot of fluffy filler.  
The salsa/condiment bar was far from what you might typically see (Baja Fresh, America's Taco Shop, etc.).  Not to say anything bad about any of those but this one is just different.  Loved the cilantro sauce and the hot habanero salsa.  You can choose between chopped cabbage or a (dry) slaw as one of your toppings too.  But really, what's a fish taco without cabbage?  
And let me tell you, their version of tartar sauce is not what you might expect either -creamy, light, refreshing compliment to the fish.  Wish I could just order the first alone just so I could enjoy some of their tartar sauce with. 
They also have a hot oil.   Interesting.  
I went with the Full and and one other.  Forgot to get pics cuz i was hungry and anxious to try these.  My son had the Gobernador and Campechana.  I tasted his quesadilla and give it two thumbs up.  We were very satisfied with our choices and glad we decided on this place for lunch.
We will be back.
