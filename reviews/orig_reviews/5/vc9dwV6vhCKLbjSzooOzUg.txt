GO OFF THE STRIP!!

Divey neighborhood - attached to the Sapphire Men's Club - separate entrance

MAKE THE TRIP!!
We were in Vegas over Easter and ate here twice!  Wish we would have found it sooner, we would have eaten there every meal.  They are open 24/7 and have great breakfast.

Had the chilaquiles - AWESOME
Had the carnitas street tacos - AWESOME
Husband had the huevos rancheros - AWESOME
The salsa was soo good.

Miss it now thinking about it......maybe a 7 hour round trip???
