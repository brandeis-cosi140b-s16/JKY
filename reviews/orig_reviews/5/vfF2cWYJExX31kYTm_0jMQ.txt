This is hands down the best Mexican food in Las Vegas in my opinion. Their horchata is some of the best I have tasted. They have Mexican corn on the cob that I would drive hours for just to eat. The staff is very friendly and it's in an amazing location. I would highly recommend this place to everyone!
