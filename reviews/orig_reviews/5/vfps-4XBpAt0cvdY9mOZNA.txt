This place is a little hidden gem.  We tried it on a whim and now go regularly because the food is Great.  The staff is super friendly and welcoming and the atmosphere is great.  After chatting with Juan (who is almost always there) and expressing interest in a particular beer, we found out he was willing to order it for us!  Now we go and eat and enjoy our special beers while we are there.  Also, they will make menu substitutions and suggestions if need be.  Try it... you will love it!!
