Loved this place! Great atmosphere! Our waiter was great and really informative, I believe his name was Luke. A very chill and relaxed environment. The food tasted so flavorful and fresh. Had the queso with everything on it(black beans, chorizo, jalape√±os) it was great. Got a couple tacos which had me craving more and a margarita that was delish! Would definitely come back. Also they get extra points for having a crazy amount of charging stations beside the purse hooks at the bar! Great date night but we could also imagine having a night out with friends here.
