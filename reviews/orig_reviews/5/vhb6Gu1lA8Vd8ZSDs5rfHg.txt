My family and I came for taco Tuesday, and we got all around great service and food. First they provided is a spot to park our stroller because it didn't fit by our table. We ordered and the food came quickly, the sissy refills were on point too (I believe our servers name was Taylor). I had three tacos with three different types of meat which were delicious. The carnitas was my favorite. The tortillas even seemed hand made. The place had really cool art on the wall. I saw some Star Wars stuff which is always cool. The only thing I kinda bothered me was that the music was too loud because it took away from having a conversation.
