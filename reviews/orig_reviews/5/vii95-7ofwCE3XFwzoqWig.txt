This place is sooo good. If you go you have to get the table side guacamole they make it right in front of you, tastes great. Got the diablo shrimp, not spicy but still tasty. Chicken quesadilla is great. All the wait staff is exceptional. Nice view of the strip if you sit on the lower section. Recommend a reservation because this place is extra busy.
