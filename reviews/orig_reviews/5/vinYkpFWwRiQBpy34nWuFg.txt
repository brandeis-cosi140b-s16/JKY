Came here twice while at the SEMA show at the convention center.  Great food, excellent service, enough vegetarian items to accommodate us non-meat eaters (a few vegan items), some good beers (double IPA...excellent choice), and the red sangria was on par with the best.  Also, what is the best way to judge a mexican food restaurant?  The chips and salsa.  They were great, if you like the super spicy, make sure to ask.

I WILL be coming back next year; in fact, I am looking forward to it.
