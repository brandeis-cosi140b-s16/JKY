This is my GOTO MexFix! 
 It will be yours as well 

I am so very happy my boss decided to hold our monthly birthday party for the staff here.  The sat a party of 11 got our drinks (Not a martini lunch) quickly, made some excellent recommendations and served up some of the Yummiest Mexican I have had in a long time.

My friend ordered this amazing burrito and couldn't finish it, yeah I had lunch the next day.
