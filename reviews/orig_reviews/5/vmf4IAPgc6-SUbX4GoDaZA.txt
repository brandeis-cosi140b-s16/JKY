I had never been here before and decided to check it out with a group of people. We were seated quickly and they accommodated my group as well as my daughter who was in her car seat. Our server was not too great as he would forget to bring a drink and check on us at appropriate times, but our food was AMAZING, ambiance was great as we could all chat without overly loud music and had a great dinner. I most definitely will be back! PS I recommend the Baked Seafood Enchilada.
