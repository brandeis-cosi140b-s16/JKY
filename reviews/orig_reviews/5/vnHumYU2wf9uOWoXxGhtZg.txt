This place was beyond fantastic. I've been trying to find an authentic southwestern place for a few months and this was it. The fire roasted salsa and guacamole and was fresh and tasted great (the salsa can be a little spicy for those who are sensitive). I had the stacked enchiladas with green chile: amazing. The meat was prepared perfectly, the dish had the right amount of green chile and cheese. Even the rice was awesome. Also had prickly pear margs that were to die for. Our waiter was polite, attentive and had great suggestions. Drinks were constantly refilled. The atmosphere was casual, they had 90s music playing, but I went in a dress and did not feel overdressed in the slightest. This will definitely become a go to for date night.
