Unlimited chips and salsa and buy one get one free Margaritas during Happy Hour: that's why we go.  The food isn't spectacular, but their signature dishes are innovative and good, although a little pricey.  There are certain menu items you can't get anywhere else.  

Try the Panuchos (Pink Tacos) which is made with chicken.  
You have to order the Pink Taco Margarita on the rocks with salt.  The BEST!!  It's Jamaica based and you can't get it anywhere else.  

Usually, we get too full on the drinks because it's buy one get one free and it has to be the same person, so expect to buy two drinks.  So we usually just get one plate and split.

For some odd reason, this Pink Taco is way better than the one in Hollywood.  And it's not because we're in Vegas and we're already having a good time, but the quality of the food and especially the drinks are better.  I know this because I've ordered the same drinks from this location and the one in Hollywood and Vegas wins!

The atmosphere here is fun and the patio is right by the pool.   This place is for lounging: eat, drink, converse and be merry without a sense of time.
