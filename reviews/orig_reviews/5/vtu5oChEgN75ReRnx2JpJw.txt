This is my go-to stop on the road from Chicago to Kentucky. As in, I'll gladly go out of the way to go to it.

The food is fantastic, authentic, full of flavor, and fast. Anything from tacos to huaraches; all good, all fresh, all the time. I've never been at a time when it wasn't busy! 

This is the hidden gem of central Illinois. If you're near C-U and you're even remotely hungry, do yourself a favor and stop to eat here.
