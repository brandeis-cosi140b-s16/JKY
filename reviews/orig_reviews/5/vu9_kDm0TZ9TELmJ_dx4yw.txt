The lady was nice enough to let us sample the meats. My wife had the 3 large tacos and i had the meat burrito. They operate like subway where you pick out what gets put on your tacos or burritos. We got it to go and it was so good! This place is going to be part of our shortlist of places to eat! Thanks
