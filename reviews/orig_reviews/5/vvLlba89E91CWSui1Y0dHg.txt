Have visited a couple of times and the food has really improved.  On our latest visit we had the Pollo en Mole taco and it was simply amazing, the Barbacoa taco was fantastic.  My husband had the Asada taco and said it would be one he would order again.  We had the habanero salsa, it was very good had lots of kick just the way we like it.  Salt and Lime will be a definite repeat.
