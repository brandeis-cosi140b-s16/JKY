Great patio outside on a nice night! My girlfriends and I went there for dinner and the service was fantastic. We had never been there before so we made reservations and they provide an industry discount after 10pm so we decided we HAD to try it! 

We each got a different drink from their drink menu, all of them were awesome, not too sweet but also did not have too much bitterness from heavy pouring I must say they have perfected the blends of these cocktails! Then we each ordered our food, and again it was to die for! 

Honestly we had a great experience and CANNOT wait to get back here to try some more of the menu both drink wise and food wise! I will certainly be recommending Mercadito to many of my friends here in Vegas :-)
