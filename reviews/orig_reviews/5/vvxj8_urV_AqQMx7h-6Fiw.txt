If you are around Chandler this is your place for dinning. We were visiting from LA and tried this place and so liked it that we came the next night too. Chips and salsa which they serve free is really good. We ordered Fajitas for two. It comes with your selection of two sides for each person. Try their special sites which is marked on the menu. We ordered steak and chicken it was also very good. Must try place.
