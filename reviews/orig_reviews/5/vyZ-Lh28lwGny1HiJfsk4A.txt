Such a hidden gem in Henderson. A friend recommended this place, glad I came here. Once we entered there was a DJ playing some house music, which went with the vibe of the place, open and very inviting. There are about 3 stations where you order your food. We got 3 chicken tacos and 3 Carne Asada tacos with everything on it! Yummmmmm is all I can say, everything is freshly prepared and made right in front of you! I tried the tacos vampiros for the first time, and let me tell you this is my favorite now! Crunchy, cheesy, delicious explosion of flavors in su boca! I'm definitely coming here again.
