Right of the bat, the food at Leticia's is the best Mexican food I have ever had in Las Vegas and I'm a Vegas native. I consider Leticia's part of my weekly nutrition plan and actually buget monthly to eat there.  The staff is always awesome and helpful. Sometimes they get very busy and the food many take a few extra minutes to come out, but I understand that happens sometimes and it's worth the wait. The prices are fair and I'm always more than satisfied when I leave there. Management is always friendly and will go out of their way to say hello and make sure all is going well when dining at Leticia's. I hate when I see negative comments about Leticia's on Yelp. People just like to complain about anything. Stay home and eat Taco Bell if your an unhappy hater! Thanks Leticia's for the great food and service every time.
