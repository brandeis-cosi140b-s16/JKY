With delicious food and great service, this place deserves a lot of customers.
First there's no salsa bar but they bring out a little condiment stand with three different salsas and they all have distinct flavor. Really good flavor :)
Location wise, I didn't have such high expectations but I was legitimately impressed. Elizabeth who took care of us is amazing and always made sure to check in with us. And she's super funny. And by the way, FREE HORCHATA REFILLS. 
I normally get their plates, the enchilada mole and divorcidas(?) are amazing. And not only that, THEIR RICE. WHAT IS IN IT. SO. GOOD.
Mom got the carne asada fajitas and legit slabs of steak came out. 
Mom is raving about how good it is. 

Overall, Myself, mom, and grandma, all give a three thumbs up here. Check this place out when yall get the chance!
