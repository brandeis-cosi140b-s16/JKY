My wife and I ate at The Mission last night and it was outstanding. The food was wonderful and richly flavored. The portion size was typical+. The specialty cocktails were also fantastic. Finally, our server was polite, knowledgeable and attentive.

I know that there are the occasional one and two star reviews but they have to handle a crush of people and they seem to do everything they can to accommodate people's desire and schedules to eat at this very fine restaurant..

5 stars.... 6 if it was available. Go.
