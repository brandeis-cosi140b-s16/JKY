If you visit or live in the Scottsdale, Tempe, or Phoenix area, do not miss this culinary delight! I am a big fan of high-end Latin American fusion cuisine, and this place did not disappoint. We started with the tableside guacamole, and gorditas. These left our mouths watering and begging for more. When It came time for entrées, we settled on the grouper, the braised short ribs, and the mahi-mahi tacos. Each dish was exquisitely crafted, artistically presented, and tasted like a little bit of heaven on the palate.  We tried a range of cocktails: from the jalapeño-cucumber margarita to the strawberry lime mojito, and each one was spectacular! To top it off, the service was great (ask for Kyle). If I lived here, I think I would have to take out a second job to fund coming here every week...
