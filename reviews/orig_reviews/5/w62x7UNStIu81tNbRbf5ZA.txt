Ive been here about 4 or 5 times now and every time the food is great. The last time the service was a little slow but there were only 2 servers and our server had a large group so I wasnt too bothered. The Avocado Fries are awesome and Im a huge fan of the Jamaican Jerk Chicken Burrito. Im excited to try out the new location in the near future.
