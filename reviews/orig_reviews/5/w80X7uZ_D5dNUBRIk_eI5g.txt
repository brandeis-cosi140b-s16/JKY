So amazing! My boyfriend and I were craving a good breakfast burrito. We are pretty picky about our breakfast burritos but the reviews were good and prices looked decent so we figured we would try this place. 

We both got the carne asada breakfast burrito add guacamole. The burrito was a perfect size. And the portions of meat, potato cheese and guacamole was perfect. The potatoes are a little crunchy which I loved!  They have a good variety of different burritos. I can't wait to come back here and try something different. 

The service was amazing. The staff was funny and energetic. It looks like a place where u order then they call your number and you get up and grab your meal but we sat down and they brought our food to us. 3 different staff members asked how we were and wanted to make sure we had everything we needed. The owner was working and out talking to everyone. Making everyone feel welcome and comfortable. He came over and made sure we got refills before we left. Honestly all around this place was great! Such a good spot to go to before your own the road or if you don't want to spend too much money but want a good meal. It's very casual so if your looking for something fancy this isn't the place for you. SO GOOD!!
