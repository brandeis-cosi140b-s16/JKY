This is mine and my husbands FAVORITE Mexican restaurant!

When you sit down they bring you chips, salsa and beans, all fresh and good! 

But we always start off with the Queso Fundido!!! This in itself  is worth the 5 star rating!!! They serve it with fresh (and i mean fresh, they lady makes them right there) tortillas! It doesnt get any better than this people!

After filling up on that i usually get the shrimp quesedilla's, always good, but i can only eat one or two of them cause im soo full and bring the rest home for the husband to eat the next day or something.

I highly recommend this place for good quality mexican food!!! The service is good, we go there a lot and the waiters know us by face and smile and stop by and say hi when we get seated if we are not in there section!

There are a few over the valley and we've been to about 3..ohh no wait 4! the one on sunset is our fav (and the closest to our house) and the one on Decatur is great as well.. the new one on flamingo and fortapache (i think thats where it was) was not our favorite though, it was different and we didnt like the Queso Fundido, which is the best part of it all!!
