Their tacos are the way mom would make them if she were Mexican and was the most amazing cook ever.

The take the filing, put it in a corn tortilla and deep fry the whole thing. Oh. My. Gosh. Just amazing. I have never eaten anything else here. The tacos are just too amazing to try anything else. I always get the shredded beef.

I don't live in PHX anymore, but every time I am here I make my way over to 7th Ave. and Indian School. It's a bit of heaven.

Note: this place ain't fancy in the slightest.
