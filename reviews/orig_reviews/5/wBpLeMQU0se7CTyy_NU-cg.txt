Great atmosphere, great food. My friends and I were looking for a place after work to just relax. We found this place and were not dissapointed. We sat at the bar and ordered tacos and some cocktails. I recommend the Puerco Verde taco and for signature drinks,  I recommend the Dirty South Andy. Just an overall great experience!
