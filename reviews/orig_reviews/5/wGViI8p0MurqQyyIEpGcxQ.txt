I have never had a bad meal at Z Tejas. Yes, its a little pricier then other mexican/ southwest places, but the quality of food makes it worth it. The free cornbread they start you out with is by far the best corn bread I have ever had. I love their Tejas Trio which is chips with salsa, handhacked guac, and queso. The amount you get of each dip is plentiful and this seems more worth it then just getting the tableside guac for the same price. For meals, my husband and I both love the chorizo stuffed pork tenderloin. It is amazing!!! Also delicious is the artichoke mushroom chicken stack. Their salads are very good and I can't get anough of the fry bread croutons they put on the salad. For dessert, I have only tried their seasonal cobbler and it was terrific. I have had it with apple and with peach. I havn't  been to Z Tejas in awhile and it makes me sad cause I really loves it. The service is always great, the atmosphere is beautiful and romantic and of course the food is unbelievable. Quick tip: Try coming here for dinner as there are more choices then what is on the lunch menu. I cant get the pork tenderloin during lunch and it makes me wanna cry   :(
