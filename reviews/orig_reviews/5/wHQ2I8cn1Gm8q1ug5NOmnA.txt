Best "street style" carne asada taco I've ever had.  

The Vampiro is basically the same think but it comes on a tostada so you have to pick it up and eat it like a vampire, thus the name Vampiro.

The salsa is great, I don't know what "style" it is because every now and again I've had it other places but it's my favorite. It's a cross between a pico and a red sauce, blended but not runny at all.

Yes they make you pay for chips and salsa, and I've seen the tiny tablespoon size take out container for salsa so beware.

Cute restored house.   I'll be back soon, if not everyday from now on.
