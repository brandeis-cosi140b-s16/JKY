From the generous pour of my favorite Tequila to the bean dip, the meal begins with awesome flavor.

Our waiter kept our tea and water to the brim. The manager even stopped by to check on us.

The good is authentic and dished out for the hungriest in the crowd.  

Ask for Michael he is the bomb diddy!

This is a consistent favorite.
