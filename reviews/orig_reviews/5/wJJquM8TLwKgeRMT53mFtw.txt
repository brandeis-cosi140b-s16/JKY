I live in Surprise but I rarely drive Reems, I have been missing this place for too long!!! I stumbled by when I started a CSA pickup at sunsational, and freaked! I noticed the sign that said same as downtown, I LOVED and recommended people to downtown a lot. Now I have it by me!?!?! So I went in and was fullllllly rewarded! Amazing food!!!! Seriously great enchilada style burrito! Can't wait to try the chimi!! And taco!! But even more, the brother who owns this location is a great business owner! He was sooooooo friendly! This is the place to go!
