YUM!  Pork belly tacos, yes!  Albondigas, definitely!  The food is all top notch.  Hot bartenders and waitresses, absolutely and I'm a straight woman.  The drinks are great too.  Lots of yummy tequila.  Keep in mind that it's a bar that serves food so first come first serve at the tables.  But they'll serve you wherever you are so just get a spot at the bar and order already!
