Well, if the Yelp reviews of this place are anything to sniff at, I knew that a treat was sure to follow after reading the mouth-watering descriptions of the Mexican/Korean fusion. Normally, I'm not sure this sounds like such a good combination, but somehow they pull it off. Boy do they ever!

I ordered the Bulgogi fusion beef burrito and fusion chicken Bulgogi tacos. Both were excellent, but the chicken tacos were unreal once you sprinkle it with some hot sauce. The spices they put on the meat just make it explode in your mouth. Each taco is small, so order three or four. You won't regret it!

The order was served with free chips salsa and guacamole. If you check-in with the Yelp! mobile app, you'll get four handmade (on site!) wontons on the house. A small orange for desert and a couple of fortune cookies and you're on your way. Despite not being busy, the order took a while to fill, but is totally worth the wait.

Certifiable mouth explosions!
