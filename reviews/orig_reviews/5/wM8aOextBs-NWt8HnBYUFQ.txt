There is an eclectic mix of musical concerts offered at the ballroom. Some we're interested in some not so much. For us the great staple is the Flamenco music and dance performance in the front room. Those guitars are reminiscent of Esteban when he used to play the Scottsdale Princess. The Southwest food is good, hearty even, and reasonably priced. The drink menu is well suited to the venue. It's a small place, often packed to the seams for performances, complaints about service have to be tempered. The servers do a good job, given the number of orders they get slammed with. We go with friends. It's the kind of place you where you want to share the experience.
