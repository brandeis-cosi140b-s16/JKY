Awesome! Tough to find, but worth the effort. Great smaller dining room. Great atmosphere. Drinks were well done. Food was perfect. Menu offered a variety of choices. Service was top notch. I can't believe this place is not packed 24/7. Jesse, our server, was knowledgable, attentive, suggestive, and professional. Yum!
