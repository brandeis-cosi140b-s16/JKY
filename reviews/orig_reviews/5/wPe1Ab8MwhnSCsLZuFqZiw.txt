If you ate at Tacos Atoyac before it closed in March, you have met Dan Maldonado. If you have eaten at the new version of Atoyac since it reopened, you may have wondered, "What happened to Dan?" Mucho Macho Taco is Dan's new venture.

Of course I was excited to try the new place. I didn't really know what to expect. One thing you should not expect is another Atoyac. You will notice right off the bat that this is a fast casual place, not a hole-in-the-wall. MMT is in a nicer neighborhood, in a nicer building, next door to a French grocery. It is not Oaxacan cuisine like Atoyac. It's not the same food or the same ambiance. I think the only thing the two places have in common is Dan and the horchata.

MMT is, much more so than Atoyac, a taco joint. Here, instead of simple, traditional street tacos with one or two ingredients, you have a whole slew (maybe 15) of taco options with more elaborate, less traditional flavor profiles. Brisket tacos with clementines and grilled onions. Bacon tacos with pico de gallo and cream (yes, bacon tacos. It's as delicious as it sounds). Vegetarian tacos, 50/50 (chorizo/beef) tacos, chicken tacos, asado, grilled fish, Baja fried fish, shrimp... These are tacos that pay homage to traditional street tacos, but are modern and creative.

This is what a fast casual taco restaurant should be. There are certain aspects of Atoyac that I miss - its fish tacos and non-taco offerings - but if you're specifically looking for awesome tacos, Mucho Macho is far superior.
