This review is based solely on the atmosphere, service, margaritas and chips and salsa. While walking through Aria looking for a bar to get a drink at we stumbled upon Javier's. There was plenty of open seats at the bar so we took two of them. The bar itself seems to be the centerpiece of the restaurant with a huge tent-like feel made of ropes. It was pretty cool. We got a drink menu right away and there were at least a dozen different margaritas to choose from. Real margaritas with fresh ingredients, good tequila and on the rocks (the only way). My wife had a pineapple margarita which was very good and not too sweet. I had their house margarita which was very good. The fresh squeezed limed juice gave it a great tangy and refreshing taste. It wasn't sweet at all which I enjoyed. It was just pure awesomeness.

What put this place over the top for me was their amazing chips and salsa. The chips were hot from the fryer (or oven to warm them) and not greasy at all. The salsa was probably the best I've ever had. Spicy, fresh and just chunky enough. It coated the chips perfectly. This is a big deal for me because I live in an area where Mexican food is about as good as you're going to get it outside of Mexico.

I could see how this place would turn into a loud tequila drinking college fest quite quickly late at night. I wouldn't make a trip here during late night hours.
