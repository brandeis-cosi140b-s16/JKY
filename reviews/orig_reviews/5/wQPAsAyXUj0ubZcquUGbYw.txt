The Mission is highly recommend!  I recently was out visiting Scottsdale from Los Angeles.  This restaurant would fit right in with some of the hottest places in Hollywood.  Everything was A++ - food, service, decor, ambiance, and especially the drinks.

The restaurant was busy on a Saturday night but with reservations we were seated immediately.  We started off with a couple of cocktails.  Everything sounded so amazing from the signature cocktail list.  I wanted to try all of them. Be sure to ask for the strawberry coconut mojito (it's not on the menu but the bartender can make it for you upon request).  It's incredible!

The food was absolutely delicious. Our appetizer was the Duck Carnitas Empanadas.  Something I normally wouldn't order but it was to die for! Then two of us split the Mango & Jimaca Salad  - light and refreshing.  Super yummy for the summer.   My entree was the Chilean Salmon.  It was served stacked in three small portions (but still plenty of food).  Cooked to perfection and the sauce was flavorful. Dessert is not to be missed! For dessert Espresso Churros and Pumpkin Bread Pudding. Don't be fooled by the name - it's not your typical Bread Pudding - it is to die for.  Everything was amazing and I was certainly full by the end of the meal. 

One of the owners (Brian) stopped by our table. He couldn't have been nicer!  Next time I'm in Scottsdale I will definitely make it a point to come back to The Mission.
