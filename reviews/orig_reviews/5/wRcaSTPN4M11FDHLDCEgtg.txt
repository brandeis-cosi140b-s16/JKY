We have been fans of Los Sombreros for a long time. We used to drive to their South Scottsdale location for great food. We were very pleased when they opened a North Scottsdale location. The owner rotates the kitchen staff between locations so the food quality is consistent. The ingredients are top notch and fresh. The food is not the typical Tex-Mex that we're all used to in Arizona. This food is from    central Mexico and delicious. Some of my favorites are the hibiscus tacos and enchiladas. All of the pork dishes are great. The adobo sauce is superb. It is a special treat to find huitlacochi on a menu. The chocolate tamale is a wonderful desert. Try this restaurant at either location. It's great!
