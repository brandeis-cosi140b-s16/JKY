Swanky and upscale without the pretention and snob factor.  All around us we saw beautiful d√©cor and delicious food being enjoyed by happy people.  The service was really exceptional and the menu was intriguing and interesting - so many things I'd love to try!

We ordered the guacamole with the crunchy corn and enjoyed it's unique and flavorful flair.  The complimentary chips and salsa was really tasty, too.

The entrees we tried were the seafood enchiladas and the battered shrimp tacos and carnitas street tacos.  Everything was delicious and we devoured every bite.

My 9 year old daughter ordered the chicken quesadilla and said it was the best ever.

We hope to be coming back sometime soon to try some more amazing cuisine.
