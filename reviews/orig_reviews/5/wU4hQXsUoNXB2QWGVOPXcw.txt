Took a chance and glad we did! Food and service were great! All of the servers were extremely attentive and on their game. Food was delicious and came out exactly as ordered. Location was a little hard to find since we were searching for a stand alone restaurant, but once we found it we were pleasantly surprised. We will definitely return!
