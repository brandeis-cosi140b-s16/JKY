After reading all the great reviews about this place, we had to come here with our rental car on our Vegas trip... and I'm so glad we did!

I got the daeji-gogi (bulgogi-style pork) burrito with kimchi, and boyfriend got the same but with classic bulgogi. We also shared some fried beef and pork-stuffed wontons (4 small ones for $1!) and complimentary chips, salsa, and guacamole.

I preferred the beef, but both burritos were OUT OF THIS WORLD and we were only able to finish about half each. (We happily saved them in foil and had them as a pre-airport snack later that afternoon.) The service was super friendly, personal, and fast. It had a very family-owned feel, and the menu noted the favorite dishes of their most frequent regulars. I so wish we had something like this in my hometown!
