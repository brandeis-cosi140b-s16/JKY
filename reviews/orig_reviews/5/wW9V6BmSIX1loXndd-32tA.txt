The best brunch I have ever had! On Saturdays and Sundays they have a tapas and mimosa brunch, which for ~$40 is a great deal.  We made a reservation, and I would advise you do the same, so that you can set on the patio close to the pool. We were there in December, but with the heaters and the sun, it was perfect.

The tapas included 26 or 27 small plates that you can order and sample. I dined with 2 companions and, between the 3 of us, we were able to sample most of the offerings. The highlights for me were the Negro Modelo-braised hash (super tender meat and a perfectly soft fried egg), the shrimp and grits (so creamy with the perfect amount of spice),  the tamales (super creamy), and for "dessert' the churro tots (just like churros, but in the form a donut hole, accompanied by berry puree and caramel). Actually, there were no bad small plates, each one flavorful and well presented.

The mimosas were also great (the brunch is $34, and you can add the mimosas for $8) and they have various flavors, including basil apple, grapefruit ginger, cucumber lemon, passion fruit, pomegranate, peach, and orange. I tried most of them, but the cucumber was the most refreshing, with the grapefruit and the pomegranate coming in close seconds.

Our service was amazing...we were sat immediatly (thanks to a reservation) at a table along the edge of the patio, so we could see out and enjoy he sun, Our server was also amazing, letting us absorb the menu and never rushing us (even though we stayed for almost 3 hours). He was very attentive, as were the other members of the team including the manager who came by to check on us and the guys bringing us our food and drinks...they were at our table quite a bit:).

This was a relaxing and amazing experience, I highly recommend it.  If you are not in to all you can eat things, the food that the people seated around us ordered looked great, with large portions and attractive plating.
