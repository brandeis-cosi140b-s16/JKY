I'll keep this short and sweet. Came here expecting nothing great. The inside was very hipster and they had good music. The service was really good but it could be because they weren't too busy yet and they were only open for an hour and it was still early. Our server immediately brought out chips and salsa for us to snack on and the salsa was delicious! Well seasoned and really refreshing. I ordered the short rib, crispy fish, and carnitas tacos and wow were they delicious! The crispy fish and short rib tacos were really good but the carnitas wasn't all that great. There was a lot of meat in the short rib taco and the crispy fish was a nice size and had a great crunch. My boyfriend had a carne asada burrito called "the beast" and wow was that amazing too! The meat was tender and well flavored and the meat had a charred grill flavor to them which made the burrito super delicious! We had their mexican 75 cocktail and almond horchata with armaretto and those were delicious too! the drinks are on happy hour all day till 5pm and they were only $5. Overall experience was great and we'll definitely be back!
