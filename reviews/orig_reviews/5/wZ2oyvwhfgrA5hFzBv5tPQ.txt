I was craving chips and salsa one day, so I checked out some reviews and came across this place. My boyfriend and I went around 6pm or so. We were seated immediately and brought our drinks. The service was great, we were given our chips and salsa to start munching on while we looked over our menus. One bowl of chips and two servings of salsa were placed on the table and we began chowing down. Chips were fairly warm and salsa was delicious. Just a little bit of spice to give it a kick, but nothing too hot at all so probably great for many palates. :) Our chips and salsa bowls were refilled before they were even half empty and same goes for our drinks. The servers definitely keep up on refills here. We both ended up ordering the same thing: sour cream chicken tacos. We each ordered two. The tacos didn't quite look as appetizing as they actually were so I wasn't expecting it to be nearly as delicious as it was. The shells have quite a crunch to them unless you let it set for awhile to soften up. I personally loved the crunch they had. The serving of sour cream served in a side dish with each plate was HUGE. I definitely didn't expect that big of a serving of sour cream either. Lots of nice surprises. So after throwing a bunch of sour cream on my tacos and adding some salsa to give it a little more moisture and spice, I devoured those tacos like it was my last meal. Our bill ended up being around $17 for our 4 tacos total with only 1 soda (I had water), and we left with full bellies. The tacos didn't look like they'd fill me up as much as they actually did, but once I started eating, they seemed to get bigger. :P I was pretty hungry by the time we arrived, so we went through about 2 bowls of chips and about 5 servings of salsa between the two of us before we actually started on our meals. So, basically we both loved everything about our experience. The chips and salsa, sour cream chicken tacos, and amazing service gets 5 stars from me! I will definitely be back!
