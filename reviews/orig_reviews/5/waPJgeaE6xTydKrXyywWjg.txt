Some of the best tacos I've ever had were in Mexico- Playa del Carmen. Since then I thought nothing could compare to the real deal.

I was so wrong.
Some friends took me here, and I was so surprised by the flavor and tenderness of the tacos al pastor. I've heard the tongue tacos are good, but I'm not gutsy enough to try it. 

Just stop by and grab a couple- they're my favorite tacos in Vegas.
