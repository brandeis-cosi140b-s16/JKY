We were in town from Kansas for a volleyball tournament and Taco Guild was highly recommended!! What a beautiful building inside and out!! The staff was very friendly and accommodating!! The tacos, guacamole and Margaritas were amazing!! Definitely a place to visit if you can!!  Thanks for the shirts
