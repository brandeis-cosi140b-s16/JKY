I have been to this restaurant many times & love it!  Great mexican food priced very reasonably.  They have three different areas to this place, an area for dining, an aread for eating outside with a very nice view of the man made lake, & there is a bar area to go enjoy some beers & watch tv.  I took my mom & step dad here when they visited Arizona & they loved it.  Anytime i'm invited out to eat with friends if we are going here I will always go!
