This place has central phoenix written all over it. I've ate her a few times and both times it has been delicious. It's just one of those places where you can just feel the "Phoenician" in. Personally, I love the tacos, but they only serve them on a few days. The green burritos enchilada style are also a favorite. The venue is cute and comfy, very minimal. It's also pretty hood, but unless you're from Ohio or something, it's not too sketchy. There are bright painted picnic tables outdoors. The crowd is diverse, from office workers, familys, youngsters ect. Everyone is there to just grab some yummy food and eat. I like the fact that it's in a neighborhood, it's a nice feel. It's very busy during lunch hours, so any time after 1:30 is perfect to drop by and grab a bite. :)
