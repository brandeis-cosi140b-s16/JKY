Topas brunch. Great selection of food. Topas as it was explained to me and as i experienced is a selection of small dishes served fresh and cooked to order. There were 21 different items on the menu and me and my friend were only able to sample nine of them before this brunch filled us up. Again all the dishes were all the dishes were made to order, we at first ordered a few to start and while we were eating the attentive serving staff asked us what we would like next and the that order was placed and came out fresh. This is amazing.

The serving staff was great and attentive without being bothersome. Next time I am in Vegas. I will be at the Border Grill.
