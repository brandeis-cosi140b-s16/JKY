For those of you with a cast iron stomach, you'll do well. For the rest of us mortals, well, I suggest staying near the bathroom the next day. 

Sounds horrible, but it really isn't. The food is really, really good. The portions are ridiculous, and they are not afraid to toss half a pound of cheese on your plate. Of course, you'll pay for it the next day, but its worth it. 

The spinach enchiladas are great, although I have no idea what that Baja sauce is, since its buried under a mountain of cheese.
