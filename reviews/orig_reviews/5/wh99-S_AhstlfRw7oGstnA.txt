This just might be my favorite bar and I wish it was closer to my house. I can only speak to the downstairs bar but it was fantastic.  

Just the walk to get down to the basement bar sets the tone for a great night. As you walk down the long cave-like staircase surrounded floor to ceiling in rock... you feel like you might be walking into a creepy cellar but at the bottom it opens up into a cozy classy bar ... equipped with fireplaces, comfy sofas and soft lighting.  

The bartenders were great. Really knowledgeable and great service. My date and I stayed well past all other patrons but the bartender didn't seem to mind at all and continued suggesting wines for us! Rokerij opened my eyes to Zaca Mesa wines... highly recommended! 

Can't wait to go back and try the food. I've heard nothing but the best and will soon be able to attest :)
