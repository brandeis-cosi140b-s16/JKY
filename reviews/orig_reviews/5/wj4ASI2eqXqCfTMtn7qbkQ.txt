Great place! For anyone questioning the quality of food just look at the pictures. I can tell you first hand the taste way out shines the pictures. They bring out salsa, beans and grilled peppers w/ onions with the chips. The shrimp ceviche is to die for while the rice and beans have the perfect balance of authentic Mexican food.  Wash it all down with a red sangria and you will not be disappointed... Really reminds me of Viva Mercados. hint, hint.
