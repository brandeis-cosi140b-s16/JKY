Very festive d√©cor with all kinds of little mermaid paintings and colorful chairs/counters. Chips are light and fresh and came with two salsas, a red and a green salsa.

Fast, friendly and attentive service.

Had the recommended crab enchiladas in a red sauce. Delicious and heavy on the crab, as it should be

BOTTOM LINE: Festive and delicious Mexican seafood in a strip-mall barrio kinda way
