What could be better than Mexican Asian fusion and a great Happy Hour?  The food selections were quite interesting and very good, very attentive staff, cool atmosphere.  Complimentary valet parking if you desire.  I liked the Korean tacos with kimchee and pretty much everything I sampled.  Some good options for vegetarians too.   I'll be back for sure.
