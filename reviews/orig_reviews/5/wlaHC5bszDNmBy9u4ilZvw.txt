Sweet baby lord Jesus this place is so good! EVERYTHING, is beyond amazing I've came here couple of times and ordered most of everything and trust me when I say that everything on the menu doesn't let you down. Very authentic and service is amazing! 
Our waiter (Gerardo) hope that's correct /:
He was outstanding! And patient with us he told us what he liked and what we liked and not only that but he was being really friendly & helpful!  Try to seat w/ him when you go!All of the staff is amazing and that's what keep me coming back (other than the delicious food) 5 stars for lindo! PS.  Try the fried ice cream and horchata!
