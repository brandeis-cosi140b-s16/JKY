Delicious! I got the carne asada salad and it was really perfect. Big, beautiful salad. The steak was cooked to perfection and flavorful. The veggies and greens were yummy. There was crispy pita at the bottom that was a bonus. 

I also got a watermelon jalape√±o margarita and it was unique and tasty. Server was also bartending, so he made it not spicy for me. 

Very friendly staff, delicious food. Sit outside and watch the lazy river. :)
