I worked with the staff to host a Birthday party for my wife.   The planning and delivery could not have been better.

We picked a selection of entrees for dinner.  Provided appetizers and the choice of drinks.   The restaurant even had cards printed up at each place setting so folks knew what was available.  (What a supAs soon as we were seated the waiters and waitresses began taking orders and bringing out the drinks.

Fabulous margaritas!  

The evening manager made sure to come over and introduce himself.  Told me to let him know if we needed anything.

Before leaving, the waitress even climbed a chair to take the big group picture.  She looked at the results on the iphone and decided it wasnt good enough so she kept taking picture after picture until it was perfect.

Overall a fabulous time.  It has always been the "go to" restaurant for my wife and I on our Vegas trips and will remain so!
