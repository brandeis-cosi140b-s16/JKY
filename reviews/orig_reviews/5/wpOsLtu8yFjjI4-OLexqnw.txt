We all know how freakin amazing these tacos are. My boyfriend and I always get 1 carne asada or adobada taco each and then we share the adobada fries with melted cheese, meat, avocado with all that yummy goodness the fries get drenched in. 

This location is much better than the one on Charleston Blvd. 
1. The place/seating area is much, much bigger. Plenty of tables and chairs to go around...even on a peak Saturday afternoon.
2. It's cleaner. No remains left over from the previous guest. I see workers cleaning and wiping down tables constantly.
3. Most importantly, it isn't as crowded as Charleston plus the line seems to move quicker here.

From now on, I much rather make a 2 minute longer drive to this location.
