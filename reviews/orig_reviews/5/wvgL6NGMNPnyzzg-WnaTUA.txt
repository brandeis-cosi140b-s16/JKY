My husband and I stumbled upon this gem. Who knew Asian and Mexican could make such a happy union! We had the Hamachu Tiradito, Shushito roll, and the Maya roll...each was a work of art, and the flavor was delicious and unique. The cocktails are also very unique and creative. I recommend the Lemongrass, Jalepeno Monk, and  Sumo-Rita. Great quality, creative dishes, expert service, and zen ambience with a party on the side.
