Great food and customer service. Average meal price is $10 if you include a drink. (They have horchata!) The food was very good and fresh. On my first visit there was a mixup and my order was misplaced. They were quick to correct the problem and gave me a few free taco coupons for my next visit. I tried their chicken bowl, best chicken bowl I've ever had. Will definitely be coming back.
