So glad we have a KoMex on our side of town so that means I don't have to make my way over to the Decatur location when craving the awesome Korean/Mexican fusion food they serve.

Good portion sizes and complimentary chips, salsa and guac when dining in.  They also do have a big flat screen at their semi-bar?!?, where you can watch sports game.  I've asked the nice woman to change the channel to watch various crucial sports games who without hesitation has with a smile!!! 

Pretty much tried everything on their menu and have yet to not like anything so if you're in the area and want to try flavorful Korean/Mexican fusion food, def make sure to stop by. Just make sure its not on a Monday lol
