I don't like to write reviews for places that have a lot of reviews already. But this place is deeeeeelicious and I would like to share my thoughts. 

My friends have been telling me about it for awhile, and I had heard about it but I was kind of nervous with the whole Asian/Mexican fusion. It didn't sound too appealing to me. This is a dive, but as I always say, I have found some of the most amazing food in the most unexpected places. 

I remembered it the other day when we were running errands and my boyfriend didn't sound too excited either after I told him what it was. I assured him that I trusted my friend's opinion and that it had really good reviews on Yelp. 

We had the following - (Mind you, this was only two of us.)
Fushion Shrimp Taco 
Fushion Daeji gogi Taco
2 chicken flautas
Fusion Enchilada Plate with shrimp, Bulgogi (Beef), Dak-gogi (Chicken).
They serve chips, salsa and guacamole. All very good. The salsa is awesome. 
Oh, as always...a Mexican coke.
This was all $17.00.

All very amazing. We both LOVED everything. Even the sauces they give you for the food were delicious!
 I went back the NEXT DAY and got the Chow Fettuccine(Thick Noodles with Meat* and Vegetables) with beef. 

***Warning, they do use a lot of garlic, so expect to be tasting it for awhile after you eat. 

I love this place, and it is one of my new favorites. The prices are AWESOME, service is friendly and very quick. Don't let the idea scare you, it's much better than you can imagine.
