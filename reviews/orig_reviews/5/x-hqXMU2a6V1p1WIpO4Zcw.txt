My husband and I shared a 3 burrito combination plate. The steak was excellent, the pork was good and the grilled chicken was very good. Our server was 5 stars. She was very friendly and she was the one to recommend the steak. The table next to use had the flaming fajitas, they looked huge and smelled terrific.
