Do you like street tacos?  I do and I feel I have pretty high standards, all of which were exceeded by this place. 

I got the combination plate (meat, rice, beans, tortillas) for just under 7 dollars. They even through in some deep fried jalapenos. That plate destroyed me in all the right ways. I ate about half of it and was completely stuffed. I got the pork BBQ and the carne asada and was pleasantly surprised by both quantity and quality. 

I'll be back.
