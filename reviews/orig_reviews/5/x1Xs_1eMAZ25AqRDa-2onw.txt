I stopped by here for the soft-opening before the restaurant was open to the public. The atmosphere inside was a huge change from Longboards, which operated in the space not too long ago. 

Inside is now wood grain floors and comfy dark leather booths. The booths are shaped in a semicircle which make the space feel more open than the standard square booths that most restaurants have. On the walls they have TVs playing Clint Eastwood western movies. And above the bar is a nice selection of Tequila bottles.

I ended up trying multiple tacos, with my favorite being the short rib. They make the tortillas in house, and you can taste it in how fresh the tortillas are. I also enjoyed the chicken mole taco which had delicious pickled red onions on top. The tacos are slightly on the small side, but they sure are good.

The staff was friendly and very helpful in giving me suggestions for tequila to sip on. Overall, I was impressed with the food and service and look forward to trying them again.
