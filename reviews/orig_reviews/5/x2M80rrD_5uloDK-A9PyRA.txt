This casual and cool locale would likely be a 4-star venue in a city with more developed cultural outlets, but in Phoenix this venue is a much needed and thus much beloved gem. The building is an interesting re-use and has excellent acoustics. The attached bar is reasonably priced. Support the ballroom with your patronage!
