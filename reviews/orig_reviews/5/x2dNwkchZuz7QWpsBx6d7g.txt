We dropped in this Saturday to watch the ASU game, and considering it had just opened (several weeks earlier than official opening from what I understand), I was really impressed with the attentiveness and friendliness of the staff.  The cantina choices for cocktails and beers were thoughtful and adventurous, and as we heard will be expanding shortly.  Two big screen TVs to watch the game in a causal setting, in the perfect area of town, were just what we had hoped for.  We will definitely be back for the full menu and will be frequent visitors to the cantina.  A very nice addition to the downtown scene.
