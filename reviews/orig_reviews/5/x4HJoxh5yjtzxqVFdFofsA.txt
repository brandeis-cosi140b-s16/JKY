Saw it on DDD and had to check it out. Small place located in a low key strip mall.  Came on a Wednesday afternoon and the place was semi empty.  Places our order of the brûlée burger and deep fried burger with sweet potato tots and French stick fries and sat down. Food came and it blew my mind away. The brûlée burger was amazing with the signature sugar burnt buns and fried egg. The deep fried burger hit all the right savory senses with its cheese sauce. And the best part of all was the French toast fries. Who would have known that the best French toast I've ever tasted would be in fry form? My only complaint would be that the burgers were a bit in the wet side. Every bite I took was accompanied by a handful of napkins soaking up the juices that streamed down my hands and wrist. However this is not a bad thing for everyone but definitely to be noted. Overall it was a great lunch and would go there again real soon.
