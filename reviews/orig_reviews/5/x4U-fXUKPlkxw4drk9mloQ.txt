Holy delicious batman! 
These tacos were amazing! Very very filling. I only ordered two and walked away completely satisfied. They have a cornucopia of salsas! 

I wish I could tell you what I had but I could not choose so I asked out server to pick two  out for me. My coworker did the same thing.

However with his, we asked about one ( his favorite) it was the shark taco.

It's quite small so lunch time it gets very packed. I would recommend getting there a bit earlier or later than noon.
