Best. Tacos. Ever.

You haven't had tacos until you've had them at this place. I envy anyone that lives near a Tacos El Gordo. That used to be me until I moved from San Diego to Chicago. People in Chicago rave about tacos and Mexican food but it pales in comparison to this place.

Order the cabeza tacos. Sure, it sounds disgusting. But I love head! *insert dirty joke here* No seriously though. The meat is moist, sweet and delicious. The perfect taco.

Also, be sure to save room for some adobada mulas. I never knew what a mula was until I came here. Basically, it's a quesadilla version of their taco. SO GOOD!

This location is open until 2am on the weekends so do yourself a favor and make a stop here. Leave the club early if you have to. It's worth it.
