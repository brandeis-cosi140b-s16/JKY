This place is awesome. They probably have the best nachos I've ever had...! If you come here, I highly recommend the street tacos menu. You can get three different ones for about $12. The tamales are also great but for best value, opt for the half dozen or a dozen and take some home!

Our server was super friendly and helpful. I really wish this place was closer to town. It's probably a contender for being the the best Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas in my opinion.
