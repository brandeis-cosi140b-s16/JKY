Wow! BEST BURGER I'VE EVER HAD! My wife and I live close by and have driven past countless times and have noticed the small inconspicuous sign but never stopped and eaten there. After a day of trying to recover from an alcohol induced evening the night before, we set out to find a good burger joint to cure our greasy hangover food craving. After looking at every place(and we've eaten at numerous ones in the area....most of them very good) within a 5 mile radius, we stumbled upon PVBC and for half the price of every other decent place around, we got twice the flavor if you ask me. Do not allow the understated location or appearance to deter you, their pickled onions(and I usually hate onions) and cucumber toppings will blow your mind with the unexpected flavor that comes from it. We played it safe this time and just went with the Paradise CHZ. After adding the brûlée option to the bun(DO NOT short yourself and order without), and choosing the thousand island dressing to top it off, this burger far exceeded my expectations and will hopefully do the same for you.
