A small taco shop right in the middle of the strip in Hawaiian Market Place. Affordable, inexpensive and the food is delicious. I always get the taco plate. I can't seem to veer away from it because I get 3 tacos which I get 3 different kinds of meat (Carne asada, lengua and carnitas), beans and rice. Their Horchata is yummy and I tried their lemonade today and it was surprisingly different.  I thought it would taste like the generic lemonade I usually get in the small restaurants but it tasted like a margarita. If you're in the mood for some good Mexican food, go to DJ's.
