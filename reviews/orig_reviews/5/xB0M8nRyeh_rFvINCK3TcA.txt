Wow the brunch was amazing. I had the Huevos Rancheros and my girlfriend had the beef brisket skillet. Both were phenomenal. Every part of the Huevos tasted very fresh, from the eggs to the homemade-looking tortillas to the sliced jalepenos and shredded radish on top. The flavors of the brisket skillet were amazing! Smokey and delicious - would definitely recommend.  The patio is great as well, overlooking the park. We were treated to live music as part of Scottsdale A'fair to boot. Great brunch - I'm surprised this place isn't more popular.
