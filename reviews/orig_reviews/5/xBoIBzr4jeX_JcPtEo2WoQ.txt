This is my favorite taco shop in Vegas! 

Everything is a home run...

1) Food...the tacos are GREAT! The potato and the pork are my personal favs! 

2) Prices...the owner strives to keep the prices as low as possible without jeopardizing the quality of the food! Myself and a friend ordered 8 tacos and 2 beers...our bill...$14!!! 

3) The Service...awesome! Super laid back and always helpful! 

If you're in the UNLV area you owe it to yourself to stop in...

PS...the new Spam taco (aloha taco) is BOMB! 

Oh and make sure to load up on the salsa! 

It's so damn tasty!
