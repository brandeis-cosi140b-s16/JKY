I have eaten here many times.  The chorizo is excellent as well as the beans and tortillas.  You can call ahead to order a dozen or so tortillas at around 3 bucks, and they are the best tortillas I have ever had, as well they freeze well.  The staff is very helpful and friendly and I have recommended to many friends and family!
