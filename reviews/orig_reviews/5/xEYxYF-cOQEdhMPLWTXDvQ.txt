My parents have gone to the original Si Señor for many years. In 2014 we stopped at the one in Chandler.

It was DELICIOUS! This year we're planning our trip to Reno making sure we go through Chandler just to eat here. I love chili rellenos and they make the best. 

We also got take out chili rellenos from the Si Señor in Los Cruces. Best ever hotel meal in our decades of travel. 

We love Si Señor!
