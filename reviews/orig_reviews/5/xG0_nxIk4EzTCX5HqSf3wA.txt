I absolutely love their Smothered Breakfast Burrito. It is loaded with eggs, cheese, hash browns, and topped with more cheese and sauce.

I love that they use hash browns. It gives it a unique taste. Many other places use diced potatoes, which is good, however hash browns make this burrito far superior to other establishments.

Good time to go get one is on Sundays, when they run 2 for 1 deals. Check with Carlito's to see current specials since they change frequently.
