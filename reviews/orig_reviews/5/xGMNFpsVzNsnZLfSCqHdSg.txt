We drove all the way from Maricopa to Sunny Slope after my teenage son and his friend saw it on Man vs. Food (duh). They each got the Del Rey which is a huge meat filled sandwich, the same one Adam ate when he was there. My son finished it and thought it was delicious...his friend thought it was just too much meat and didn't finish his.

I had a Beef Nortena which was flavorful and spicy and HUGE! 

I forget what our other friend had but she was very happy with it. 

The menu was extensive but we didn't really look it over since we knew we were coming for the Tortas (Mexican Sandwiches). Service was great but do not expect the waitresses to speak fluent English. 

My kids enjoyed the kids menu too!

It really was a TREAT and if we are ever up that way again it is someplace we would go again!
