We decided to try this place out for dinner when we arrived in Vegas. We decided to order the chicken El Jefe Nachos and 3 Carne Asada tacos.... WOW! My fianc√© and I  decided to share this meal! The nachos are HUGE!!! They are by far the best nachos ever! Plus they were super cheap! The following day... Since we liked what we had we decided to go for breakfast. I got the chilaquiles and another WOW! This was the most amazing thing I've ever tried!! I would recommend this to every single person. Now we are here 3rd day, we just heard they are closing down. Apparently Some Italian chain bought them out. We are absolutely heart broken. We thought we found our new favorite spot. The staff has been amazing! Especially Cynthia.... I'm saddened to hear they will no longer be here. Service is ahhhh-mazing, just like to food!
