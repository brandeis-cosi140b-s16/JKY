Gosh this place is good. Pay $2 per taco inside and get your tacos at the stand in front  of the grocery store. I'm full for $4. 

All the meats are good and there is so much variety. Chorizo, barbacoa, ribeye, beef tongue, chicken, vegi, ... etc. The salsa bar is also very fresh and delicious. There are 4 or 5 different types of hot salsas,  fresh salsa, salsa verde, cilantro, tomatoes, onions, and guacamole. 

Since this is actually a grocery store there is no where to sit. But they encourage you to stand around a eat, and quite a lot of people do. If you want the tacos to go, you can package up all of the salsas too.

In the back of the store at the butcher, they even sell fresh chicharones. (They also have a variety of packaged ones). The one I got at the butcher was a piece bigger than my face!

Not sure why the info says this place does not take credit cards, but I've used a credit card to pay for a total less than $2 before..
