I went to this store for the first time ever, and I was very impressed b/c I found everything I went in for and then some, great prices, fresh meats and they have a butcher that will cut meats for you right in front of you. I am glad that I found this place b/c usually I have had to make lots of stops to pick up things in different places, I am Puerto Rican,(Hispanic from the Caribbean)  and we look for certain things that are not found in Food City, you can find them at LeeLee's but at higher prices, but here I found them all and at great prices!!!!!
