The boyfriend and I drove up here on a lovely spring afternoon for lunch on their patio that was open onto the bar area.  They had several flat screen t.v.s which offered viewing of the March Madness games.

We started with chips and salsa (I was not a fan of the flour chips mixed in, boyfriend liked them).  He also ordered a side of the Inferno sauce, which the waitress explained to us as not starting out too spicy, but watch out, because the heat builds!  The boyfriend actually had to stop eating the salsa when our food came because his mouth was on fire and he wanted to be able to taste his food. 

We were able to take advantage of the Yelp special (buy one get one free lunch).  I built my own chimichanga and he built his own burrito.  Both were delicious.  I also got the honey flan for dessert.  It was also delicious, but very rich, and I couldn't finish it!

We will definitely come back here to taste many of the other things off of the menu.  The service and ambience were great and the salsa was hot!
