I love this restaurant. But I am a creature of habit and just order the same thing every time I come here. They seriously have the best shrimp cocktail- and the size of their medium shrimp cocktail is a whole meal in itself. The shrimp is so fresh and there about 50 large shrimp in your bowl. Don't fill up on their chips, salsa and retried beans though! Those are good appetizers as well. For dessert don't forget the sopapillas with vanilla ice cream. It's to die for!
