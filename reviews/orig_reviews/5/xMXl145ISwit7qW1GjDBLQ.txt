Wow what a hidden gem this place is!!! Stopped in with my mom and sister. I ordered a bean tostada, pastor street taco and some chips and salsa. Everything tasted fresh and amazing. Beans were creamy, salsa was a fresh pico de gallo, chips were crispy, and the pastor was succulent and a little hint of spice. My mom ordered the steak fajitas and they were well worth the wait. The meat was tender and flavorful and the onions and peppers were caramelized and perfectly seasoned. The rice had such a great texture and hint of flavor that I loved. My sister had a veggie street taco which I had a bite of and it was surprisingly good. It was beans, peppers, onions, potatoes and avocado. The only negative was the ladies bathroom was in disrepair and a little dirty. However the food and quick service was outstanding. I will definitely be back.
