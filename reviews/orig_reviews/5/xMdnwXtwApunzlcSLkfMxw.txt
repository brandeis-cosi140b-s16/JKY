Love all the dishes that I have tried so far. We started going back to this restaurant after a long hiatus. Still as good as it used to be. Love the Combination plates and they are big. I always substitute the charro beans for the plates that come with refried. The green salsa is to die for. Service has never been bad. It is a must try.
