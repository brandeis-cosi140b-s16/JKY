This place is very convenient if you are staying at the Luxor, which we were when we stopped in a couple of different times.  

Both times the food was excellent.  The one thing I loved the most about this place was the chips and salsa.  The chips were to die for just perfect in their crunchiness and they went well with the salsa.

The salsa was fairly mild, however, they left you many other sauces on the table that you could add to the salsa to your taste.  This was fun and you could experiment with how hot you wanted your salsa.

The dinners were a decent size and not too big.  I never felt like I would have to take any back to the room (we had the luxury of having a refrigerator so that actually was an option).

The atmosphere was nice just off the atrium level near the Bodies exhibit.  This used to be another type of Mexican food place some years back, which was good but this is ten times better.

I'll stop back in again.
