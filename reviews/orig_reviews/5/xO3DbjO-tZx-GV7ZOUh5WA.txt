Let's keep this review simple.

EVERYTHING here is fantastic!
The cornbread is the best we've ever had!
Oh man...the desserts...beyond belief...and the ones' in the skillet are tops!
Then the Chambord Margarita's...they limit you to 3 max and for good reason!

All we can say is GO!  We can't visit Scottsdale and NOT hit ZTejas!
