Not sure where you'd find a better street taco in Phoenix. The al pastor is awesome, as is the fish, and the shrimp. I didn't try the carne asada, but Athena says its great. They were out of chorizo. dammit. 

Note: Many other patrons had to study the menu when they were informed of the chorizo outage. Apparently it's a fave and a "go-to" item.

I went with my usual number of 6 street tacos. Athena had 3 with black beans - which were creamy and dee-lish. That's about the right way to do it for us, although others opted for 10 tacos or 2-3 tacos and a burrito. 

One lady (seemingly a regular) went directly for some type of tostada. Seems you can't go wrong however you do it. Everyone there went with the Mexican Cokes, except for one guy that had a diet coke. Whatevs.

I didn't ask about the $7 toasted tortilla. Although, as one of the most expensive items on the menu - we were curious. It cant just be a tortilla can it?

Historical note: some of you may recall this place used to be the best place for a great Chicago Dog...Mr. Mort's, until he retired long ago. I miss that place, but this is a great replacement!

Traffic note: the light rail construction makes this place a bit tricky to get into, but not too bad.

Vacation note: If you are reading this between July 2-9th, 2013: it'll be closed for their vacation!
