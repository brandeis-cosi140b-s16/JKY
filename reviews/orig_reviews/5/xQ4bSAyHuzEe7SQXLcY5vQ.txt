This is hands-down, one of the best restaurants in town. My husband and I have been here to eat many times and the food is consistently excellent. The restaurant is always clean and the staff is super friendly. When it came time to decide on what food to serve at our intimate backyard wedding, the choice was clear. Dave (the owner) worked with us on creating a menu of our favorite foods and arrived the day of our wedding prepared and professional. And of course, the food was amazing.
