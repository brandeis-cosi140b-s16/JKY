I have been in Phoenix, AZ for a short time now and I must say that the best place I have eaten at is Mi Patio Mexican Restaurant.  Yes, the food is above and beyond what I expected.  Not only is the food worth your time but so is the service.   Fantastic people, fantastic food, go have a fantastic time!
