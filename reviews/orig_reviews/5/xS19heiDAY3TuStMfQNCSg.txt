Carolinas is pure happiness.  I go there atleast once a week.  The tortillas are made fresh and the salsa is amazing.  There's not a single item on the menu that I don't enjoy eating.  For a great deal go with the #3 combo which comes with a tostada, enchilada, beef taco, rice and beans all under $5.50
