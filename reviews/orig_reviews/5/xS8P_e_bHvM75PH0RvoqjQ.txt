Lenero Grill is awesome! Their food is not your typical Mexican food as we know it.It is better! The food is from Northern region of Mexico.be sure to try the grilled shrimp appettizer with grilled veggies....it is amazing! As are the grilled steak and chicken tacos.
The atmosphere is casual but added touches,such as fresh cut flowers,and white table cloths,amazing and friendly owners and staff,give this place a touch of class.
There is also live music that is a real mix of cultures and appeal.
Love this place;it is our new hangout!
