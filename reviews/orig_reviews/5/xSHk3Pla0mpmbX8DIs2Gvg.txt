I was randomly looking for somewhere to eat lunch today, saw some pics of the food and thought I would give it a try. Legit probably one of the best things I've ever tasted. The carne Arvada is so flavorful it's unreal. One of the staff told me how they smoke the meat and chilies and they def do a phenomenal job. I'll absolutely be back.
