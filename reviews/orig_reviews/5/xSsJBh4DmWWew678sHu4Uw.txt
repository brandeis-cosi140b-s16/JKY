This is a brand new location it was very busy.  The reason is the food is fresh and Delicious.  It was lunch on a Thursday and the line was long.  I believe they will get this all worked out.  I had a baja burrito with a seaweed wrap.  It is like eating a big sushi roll.  You call what ingredients you want and they roll it up in front of you.  Check this place out.
