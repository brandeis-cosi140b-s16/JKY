The ultimate experience.. From the minute we walked in.. Greeted by Vanessa who had a friendly upbeat attitude.. Seated and served promptly with ice water, chips & salsa! Exactly what you want when it's 109 degrees outside on a Saturday. She told us about their $5 drink happy hour- we were IN! Serrano Cucumber Margarita, blood orange margarita, pineapple mojito, & high roller marg! All the drinks were outstanding!!! We had a cup of the tortilla soup and added a spoon full of salsa.. So delish! We each had the 3 tacos with a side.. All of our tacos were fabulous! My husband is mexican and he was even impressed!! So you know it's good!! The service was top notch!!! On point, period! 
All in all --- a Hip Mexican joint with Great food!!! 
Cannot wait to go back!!
