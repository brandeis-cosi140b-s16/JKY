I drove past this place SO MANY times, and just ate there for the first time last weekend. Needles to say, I feel like an ass for not having ate here sooner! The food was amazing, the service was good, and the prices were more than fair. They also have these key lime candies that my boyfriend is addicted too, so that was a nice finish. I look forward to eating here again soon, and hope to try their aqua fresca's
