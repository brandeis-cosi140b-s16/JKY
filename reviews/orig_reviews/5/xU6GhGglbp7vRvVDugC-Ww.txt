Why did I not eat here ever before in my 28 years?  

I have always lived around this area and seen Las Glorias Grill in the small strip mall behind the Circle K at 19th and Northern.  My husband and I decided to finally try here tonight when we wanted mexican food.  It was DELICIOUS!  We usually go to places like Garcia's, Manuel's, and Macayo's but I think that will be ending now that we have eaten here.

The chips, salsa, and bean dip were brought out to us very quickly along with our drinks.  The chips were very fresh with just the right amount of salt on them.  The food was brought out pretty quickly thereafter.  I ordered the shrimp enchilada and my husband order a beef chimichanga.  The chimichanga looked like it  was lightly fried - just to the right level of fried.  The shrimp enchilada was probably the largest enchilada I have ever seen.  The shrimp were large and the amount of them in the enchilada was very generous.  The flour tortilla used for the enchilada was very light and tasty.  Both entrees came with rice and beans.  I would say that the rice was right on par with what is made in other restaurants but I believe that the refried beans are better here.  

The service was prompt and very attentive (unlike previous experiences at other restaurants).

I would definitely recommend coming here instead of going to any of the more familiar chains out there!
