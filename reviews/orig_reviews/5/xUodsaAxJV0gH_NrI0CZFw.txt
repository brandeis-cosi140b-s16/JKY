Just went to this inviting little restaurant for the first time and felt compelled to write a glowing review. I had two of their gourmet tacos: shrimp with portabello mushrooms and chiccarones, and I can honestly say that these were the best tacos I've ever eaten: everything was so fresh and seasoned so well, and the portions were generous. My friend and I also shared 1/2 order of guac and chips - plenty for two, and also very flavorful and well-seasoned. I'll tell all of my friends and can't wait to return!
