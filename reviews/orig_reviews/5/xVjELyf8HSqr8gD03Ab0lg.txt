Amazing food!! All organic veggies and wild caught fish!! Would come back everyday if I lived closer!!!! Will come back for sure on my next visit to Vegas!!! We had the table made guacamole...you can't get any fresher than that! I had the shrimp bowl...which was like a shrimp burrito without the shell!! The cilantro rice was cooked perfect and the shrimp where awesome...all the flavors of the dish where well balanced and I would totally get it again! My mom had the cider glazed salmon and her plate cleaned...she loved it!!! And for dessert we had the flan which was so smooth and flavorful the best flan I have ever had!! And we also ordered the fried ice cream which was heaven!! The staff is great, very friendly, and attentive.  The GM and the chef both came out so see how we liked our meal! They could tell by our clean plates that they did a job well done!! Thank you so much for such a great experience!!
