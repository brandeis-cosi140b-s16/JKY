Amazing views!!!!! Number one thing. Man but you better have a reservation any night of the week! This place is always packed and for a reason! 

Food=amazinggggg. So moist, flavorful and cooked to absolute perfection. I love to get the coca cola pork. Wrapped in their fresh tortillas... Perfection. 

Service? Amazing as well. Always refilling my drink and very attentive, yet you don't feel like you're being rushed out of the restraunt.

Ten stars. Love this place.
