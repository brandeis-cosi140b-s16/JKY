I am so happy I walked into this place for the first time. I love Carlito's!!! I take all of my friends here when they visit from out of town. 
There's so many good things about Carlito's all of their weekday specials, dollar beers, & friendly staff. 
It's always an enjoyable experience here. 
So glad you're right down the street from me. 

If you haven't tried don't hesitate this place is the best around!
