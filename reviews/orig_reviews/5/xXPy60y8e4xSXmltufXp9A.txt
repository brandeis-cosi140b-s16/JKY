Probably my favorite establishment in the Atwood area, which is saying a lot if you know how great the Atwood area can be. Here are all the reasons that TT won me over:

1. Free Chips & Salsa (with a check in offer via the Yelp app)
2. A salsa bar, so you can dip those chips in 4 different types of salsa. My favorite is the green one for sure.
3. Great (albeit small) rotating tap selection of craft & local brews. You'll always get something good.
4. A good variety of margaritas. You can either stay with the basics, go fancy, or try an interesting flavor.
5. The tacos. There's a good variety of unique choices to be had, including a sweet potato one, a veggie tostada, and a fried avocado one.
6. The burritos, especially the Schenk's Corner. One of the rare times I feel full after eating a burrito while NOT also feeling gluttonous.
7. Vegan nachos vegan nachos VEGAN NACHOS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
8. A decent spot to get brunch on the weekends as it's tasty and not very crowded.
9. The menu is constantly evolving. Since I started going regularly, i've run into numerous new items that I've adored.

If these points don't sell you to come check it out, then I don't know what to tell you.
