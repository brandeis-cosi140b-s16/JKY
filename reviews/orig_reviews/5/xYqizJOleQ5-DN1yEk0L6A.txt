All the positive reviews are true.

Tacos El Gordo really exceed my (high) expectations in every possible way.  The tacos adobada with pineapple are really to-die for.  I kinda knew they would be when I walked in and saw the rotating column of spicy pork hanging from the ceiling.  Yum.  Nothing says quality tacos like spinning meat.  Really.  It's true.  The tacos were really more delicious than I could even wrap my mind around - it was like a fiesta in my mouth!  I was so blown away that we've been back several times since our first visit which was, embarrassingly enough, only a few days ago.  My fianc√© apparently doesn't like my cooking anymore... he just wants tacos.  And that's fine with me... fewer dishes to clean.  ;)

Oh, and as others have mentioned, this place is immaculately clean and the workers are friendly.  They are quick to take your trays when you are done, and they were washing the walls last time I visited.  The tables and other surfaces are always sparkling, and the workers always seem to work hard.  I absolutely love the people at Tacos El Gordo - friendly, smiling service every time, even at 1 in the morning!
