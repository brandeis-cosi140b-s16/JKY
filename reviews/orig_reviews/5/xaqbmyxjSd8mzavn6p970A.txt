Easily one of my favorite place in Tempe.  The food is great and a bit original (not your basic south of the border fare).  The atmosphere is nice too (pleasant but with a bit of attitude).  

I love Mexican food and these people do it with a unique flare that is worth checking out.  I have been there for lunch a dozen times or so and dinner a few times and never once disappointed!


The only complaint I might make is their parking lot is too small (when that is the worst you can say they are not doing too bad).

In summary great food, great atmosphere - a great place to hang out with friends for a quick or a long dinner - whatever you are feeling like!
