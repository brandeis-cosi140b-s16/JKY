Dinner on a Thursday night starting at 6pm downstairs table.

It was beyond excellent, the servers downstairs ( Jeff and Steve ) bust their ass at every table, not just ours. The beers were always full, the food was served without a delay and our guest was impressed, and that is exactly why we take clients there. Dinner is pricey, but I have never been overcharged and always welcomed when you walk in. I am looking forward to Richardson's opening so it will be a bit easier to get tables downstairs.

Thanks!
