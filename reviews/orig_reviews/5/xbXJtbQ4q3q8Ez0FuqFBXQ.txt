I LOVED this place.  2 for 1 margs are great.(We got the mango ones).  We ordered 3 different entrees, chimichangas, shrimp taco and flauntas and each had one of the items off of each plate.  We got the tableside fresh guacamole. Peyton made it and it was AMAZING!!! So great, that we went back the next day to find that he wasnt working and we had someone else make it. It was still good, but not like his!  He added all the ingredients minus the avocado first and mixed everything up THEN put in the avocado. It made a world of difference!!!  The service, prices and food were all excellent!
