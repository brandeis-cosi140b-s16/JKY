Sitting at the bar, waiting for the rest of my party, was the best thing to happen yet! 

The bartenders were friendly, helpful, and busted their butts! The drinks were made fresh and they even refilled our drinks with the leftovers from our mixers. Also, while enjoying our drinks, I noticed they kept making fresh lemonade as it was ordered.

The entire staff were very friendly and flirty, too. I guess whatever it takes to make a buck BUT at least they treat you well.

I'll be back when I'm in town again.
