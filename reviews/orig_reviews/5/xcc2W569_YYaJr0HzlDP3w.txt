You can never go wrong with the bulgogi nachos.  The chips are always crisp,  toppings are plentiful and portion size will fill you up. The fusion beef sliders with fries are great. Who knew a bulgogi cheesesteak would be so delicious, they did that's why it's on the menu. I love getting the pork belly skewers as an appetizer. I always leave full and satisfied with some leftovers to take home.
