I started off the with chips and guacamole and the guacamole is absolutely delicious. It has orange slices and topped off with cotija cheese - yum! The chips were a little too crispy for my taste but still not terrible. It is made to order so I was able to get it without the onions. 

Mike was my server and was absolutely wonderful. Made great recommendations and made sure I was happy. Had the grilled shrimp taco and the carne asada taco. The slaw on the shrimp taco was perfect and was topped off with some of that wonderful guac. The carne asada was cooked perfectly and was very delicious. 

Definitely has a great vibe and I cannot wait to visit again!
