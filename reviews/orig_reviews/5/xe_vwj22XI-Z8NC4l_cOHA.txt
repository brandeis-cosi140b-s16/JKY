It's very hard to find good Mexican food in Vegas - especially good Sonoran style - but Hecho nails it. Being from Tucson, I'm very familiar with Sonoran style, and familiar with the family who partnered to open Hecho. The food takes me back home instantly. I especially enjoyed the enchiladas banderas. Prices are a little up there but not out of line for a Vegas restaurant. Overall, great place to enjoy some great food!
