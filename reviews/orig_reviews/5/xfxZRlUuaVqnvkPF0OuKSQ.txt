This Restaurant is proof that GOD exists! The staff is immensely amazing, the food is organic, yet TASTY! If you are a picky eater like myself I recommend this place. NO need to compete other yelp reviews (trust me strangers :)), I promise you won't regret this immaculate restaurant! (OH yeah & Go see Paco!!)  VIVA EL DORADO!!!!!!
