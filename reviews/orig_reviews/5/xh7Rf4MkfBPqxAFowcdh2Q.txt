Looking for a place to eat after an exhaustive day dodging the scammers on the strip.  We were blown away by every aspect.  To start, the salsa and chips that are complimentary we're fantastic.  We ordered our food and a woman came around and made fresh guacamole.  The interesting thing about this is that my wife and I have never been guacamole fans but now we are.  The carne asada with mole was the star of our order.  Love it!
