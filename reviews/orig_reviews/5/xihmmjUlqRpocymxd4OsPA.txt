At first glance, the breakfast menu is seriously underwhelming. However, having now had the house Eggs Benedict with black truffle hollandaise sauce and chorizo over fresh tomatoes (with actual taste!), this place is going into the delicious breakfast rotation. Service was great (we were the first people there and wary of being alone in such a large restaurant), and the coffee was super tasty. Breakfast burrito, custom omelet and the eggs benedict were all perfectly cooked, the roasted potatoes on the side a serious star of the morning. Love the super modern Latino decor throughout the restaurant and The Saguaro Hotel.
