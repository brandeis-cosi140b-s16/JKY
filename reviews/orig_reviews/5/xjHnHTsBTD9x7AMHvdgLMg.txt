I'm impressed.

Excellent service. (Carlos helped us. He and the support staff were great). Quick and attentive.

A lot of attention to detail as far as overall design. From the interior to the plating, nothing felt sloppy. 

Satisfying & authentic food. Some items hit the mark more than others. My brother loved his Cabo Azul. 
Good generally not served spicy. They have a salsa picante available and it is incredibly spicy. Definitely worth requesting if you like hot food. (Not tobasco hot. Habanero chili, your mouth will tingle spicy). 

It is pricy. Not an everyday place, but a great experience when you can make the trip.
Take a look at the bar and desserts, some interesting options.
