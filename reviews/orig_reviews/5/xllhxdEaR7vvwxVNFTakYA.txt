This has to be one of my favorite places for a flavor of a Mexican meal with the best cheese sauce ever. The green Chile on anything is delicious plus can't beat the $0.99 margaritas after three. The service is prompt and the food taste great. The atmosphere is lively yet personable. I love coming here.
