We had a tough time finding a restaurant that would host us 22 people without freaking out and placing us on a contract and a fixed menu.  This place was the only option we found!  We were starving when we arrived at 8:30, and almost dying by the time were seated 30 minutes later.  We were definitely getting cranky, but everything changed when he seated us at the most AWESOME group dining room ever!  It had a HUGE table, with large wooden chairs and an incredible ambiance.  It was the perfect size for our group and we had our own waiter who organized all the servers and busboys to keep us well attended.

The food was also very good.  Of course there was the chips-N-salsa (which we loved- the salsa had a nice flavor to it and was well-blended... also not too spicy).  The entrees were all a bit smaller than I would have expected, but no one complained about not having enough to eat.  Even though we were starving when we got there, I suppose we filled up on the chips and margaritas :)

The margaritas were very good (everyone tried a different type).  The strawberry one was like a smoothie (not sour at all), the pineapple was very tart, the tamarind was sweet ("like an iced tea margarita!").

The food was a little pricey, but definitely no complaints.  The service was amazing! (We were a large party, but they managed us very well).  The waiter even sported a stick-on mustache that we gave him so he would match the rest of us! (Very nice touch, props!)
