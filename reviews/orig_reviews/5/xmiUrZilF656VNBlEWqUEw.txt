By far some of the best food I have ever had.  Not just the best Mexican food, but some of the best ever.  With all the great restaurants in Vegas, Lindo's beats them all.  I ordered the Fillet de something?  It was orange roughy with shrimp and octopus.  Just the right amount of heat with corn tortillas on the side.  Our server Dhiadora (I think ) was great.  Very attentive and makes a tasty Margarita.  I'd give it 14 stars if I could!
