Also:  it is a little intimidating/overwhelming on your first visit.  I stared at the menu board for about 2 minutes and was still undecided and somewhat confused,and  thats when the gal behind the counter asked if i had ever been there before and proceeded to very patiently and thoroughly explain the process and the options...that was very helpful.  Granted, there was no one behind me in line (i got there right as they opened).  By the time i left, the place was packed and there was a long line, so others may not have had the opportunity for full explanation as did i.  Just something to keep in mind on your first visit; its kind of like a crash course in a new language.. but worth the effort!
