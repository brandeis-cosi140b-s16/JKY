We come here every Time we come to phx. We have a vacation home here and it is just a few blocks from out condo.  Im on a strict diet and the servers always accommodate my suggestions. My favorite is the salmon with spinach and sweet potatoes.  I love love love that.  
We reccomend this restaurant for its food, service and atmosphere.
