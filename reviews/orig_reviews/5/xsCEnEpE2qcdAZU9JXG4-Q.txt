I have been going to this place probably since I was in the womb. They have good prices and good food. I love the chips and salsa. I wish they still did the cheese crisp on mondays for free after 5pm (maybe they will bring it back hint, hint)...
It is in a smaller converted house in south phoenix with a take out area in front and a bar in the back. This place fills up quick on the weekends be prepared. Only thing I do not like is sitting out in the main area when you first walk in everybody is looking at you when they walk by I prefer the back room or the bar.
YUMMY...... food try it for yourself.
