I HIGHLY recommend this place for tasty Mexican food! 

If you eat there they bring you chips and salsa while you wait for your order. You can sit inside or outside, they bring your food to you. 

We got tacos and taquitos. DEFINITELY order the pork tacos. The pork... Oh my gosh the pork.... Idk what they do to it but it is so delicious!! The taquitos were also delicious but you can't really go wrong with it. My only gripe is that there was no guac with they taquitos. 

If you're looking to fix your Mexican craving come here!
