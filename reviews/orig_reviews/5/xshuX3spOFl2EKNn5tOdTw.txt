This place has been around for as long as I can remember. Each time my family and I have come here, the food is always on point and never a disappointment. Their ticket times are quick, they food is tasty and full of flavor. You have a choice between two salsa's, both are very good! I have yet to find any restaurant that can compare in their food. Many of their dishes are very comforting and remind me of the way my grandmother used to cook. Staff is quick and friendly. 

My family and I will always be loyal customers of Comedor Guadalajara!
