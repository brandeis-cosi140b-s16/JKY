Produce is all local and incredibly fresh.  Carne asada, al pastor, and chorizo explode with flavor and you can tell that he buys from great butchers.  And the horchata is REAL horchata, made daily, in a pot.  Not that bubbled, sugary stuff you get at so many mexican restaurants. The menu is Oaxacan-style, not the standard fare Sonoran that is great, but everywhere.  If you want delicious, fresh, and slightly different mexican food, Atoyac is the best choice in Phoenix.
