I've been here twice, both times while visiting from Washington state. The first time I got a burrito, I don't remember what was on it, but it was delicious. The most recent time I got a steak quesadilla and it was one of the best thing's I've ever eaten. The cheese wasn't normal melted cheese, it was more of a cheese sauce and there was plenty of it. There was plenty of steak which was fantastic and plenty of grilled onions and peppers. It was also massive, it fed me for 2 meals.
