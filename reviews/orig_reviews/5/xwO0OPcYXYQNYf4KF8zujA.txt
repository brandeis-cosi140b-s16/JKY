Chicken machaca...absolutely beautiful!  Slow cooked, spicy, dripping magical mouth-feel goodness.  To anyone who has tried this place and given it mediocre marks, your mistake was in ordering the wrong thing. 

Side notes: Limonada...perfect!  My favorite is the strawberry, but all are worth a try.  Creamy rice is buttery and smooth.  Black beans are healthful.  Get a VIP card and score a sweet meal for under 8 bones.  

Side-side note: To all YELP haters...to all the "I wanted to like this place, but..." or "My friend said it was amazing, but..." or "I'm giving this 1 star because they forgot to hold the onions..." YOU ARE MAKING A GRAVE MISTAKE.  Yelp is not your personal bitch-fest.  I'm sorry you live an unhappy life, or your job sucks, or you suffer from a horrible skin condition.  The fact is that small businesses are made or broken by your thoughtless reviews.  If you have a suggestion, see the "suggestion box."  If you want to hate, please stop doing it in my neighborhood.  I want more independent, homegrown businesses like Revo...and fewer Chili's and Applebee's.  

Final note: I have no connection to Revo Burrito...I just love the food and my neighborhood.  See you 'round.
