This place was pretty cool.... literally! They have some outstanding air conditioning there... anyways... food was amazing, especially the guacamole. The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful and you could tell that they enjoy being there. This is a great place to eat, and I will definitely be back next time I visit Phoenix.
