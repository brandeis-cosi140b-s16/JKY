Atmosphere, atmosphere, atmosphere! Not to downplay their great menu, but if you are looking for a great place to take a friend, family, date, etc. this is it. There's great seating outside beside the giant duck pond that features geese, ducks, and turtles which is fun for kids and adults. A favorite among my friends and I is the Jalapeno Cream Sauce which you could put on honestly any of the meals and it would go great. 
Three different kinds of salsa served with the tables chips is another fun feature. Go up and treat yourself to one of their many margarita's, you wont regret it!
