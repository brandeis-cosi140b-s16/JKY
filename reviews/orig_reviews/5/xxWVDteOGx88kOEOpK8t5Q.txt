Some of the reviews here are ridiculous (1 star because they use an iPad?!?).

Los Dos Molinos has, by far, the best Mexican food in Ahwatukee and is one of the best Mexican restaurants in Phoenix.  If you don't like spicy, go somewhere else. There is no "mild" or "medium" here - you either get non-spicy or cry-and-sweat crazy spicy.

The service is phenomenal. Some of the waiters aren't great, but the owner is so determined to make everything perfect she more than makes up for some of the crappy waiters. And the food - amazing. Delicious, spicy, perfect.

Highly recommended if you like spicy Mexican food.
