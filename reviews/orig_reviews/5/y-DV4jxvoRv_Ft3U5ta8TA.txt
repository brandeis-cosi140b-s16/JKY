One of the best places in town to grab some tacos! Not too expensive, either!

I had a Taco De Asada (steak), Taco De Buche (pork), Taco De Adobada (spicy pork), and half an order of Adobada Fries. The Asada was nothing too special; your normal asada from any mexican restaurant.  The Buche was labeled as pork, so I was surprised when I bit into nothing but pork INTESTINES! It was surprising, but I LOVE pork intestine. Extra plus for that pleasant surprise! =]  Finally, their Adobada is DELISH if you can handle a little bit of spicy. They cut it off a huge slow revolving chunk of pork, and serve it to you. YUM!

As for their service, as I walked in, the place was PACKED. The servers were helpful and made the food on the spot as we ordered. When we approached the cashier, you can get your fixing of sides (limes, etc). All the tables were taken when we paid, so my party and I looked around. A group left as they saw us waiting for a table, and a worker walked straight over to clean the table for us! That's faster service than any other restaurant I've seen (high class or fast food alike!).

I will definitely come back, but since I live on the southwest side of town, coming here was quite the journey. Of course, it was worth it! =]
