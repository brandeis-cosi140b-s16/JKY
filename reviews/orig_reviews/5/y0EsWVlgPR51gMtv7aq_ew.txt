Got invited here by a friend who just started working here....was really busy do we sat at the bar. The queso was amazing. Had pork in it. Not really a pork guy but it was tasty!! Damn good. The steak burrito with green chili was also really good. I can usually finish my plate but today I did not! Great portion size! Kenzie was our waiter. Awesome and patient with all our questions! Great first impression. I will be back!
