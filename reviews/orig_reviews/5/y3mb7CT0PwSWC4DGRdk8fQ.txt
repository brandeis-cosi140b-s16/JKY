Matta's is BACK!

I'm pleased to announce that it's all very familiar. This tradition goes back to 1953. For me, it's been 20 years as a loyal patron. When the original building closed, I found out on my birthday (a personal tradition to eat here on my birthday) - I actually cried. 

They were supposed to open the new location a year later, but it has been 3. Well, it was worth the wait. 

The new building is gorgeous and huge. The food still tastes awesome. The margaritas are the same. The Salsa is the same. Even some of the staff is the same.

It was a long wait, but it was well worth it. 

The new Matta's is located in the Mesa Riverview Mall that popped up out of nowhere and was overshadowed by Tempe Marketplace just a few blocks away. 

They apparently had a soft opening last night and a large opening tonight. In spite of being a huge place, it was packed. Total chaos. We didn't quite get every item we ordered and a few items were different from what we ordered, but who would expect an opening night with a packed house to go perfectly smooth. And anyway, any mistakes were smoothed over and made up for. 

Matta's is back and I'm going to be spending a lot of time here. 

I still think this is the best Mexican food restaurant in the Valley. I love you, Matta's. 

I will update this review after a few more visits. So far, so good.
