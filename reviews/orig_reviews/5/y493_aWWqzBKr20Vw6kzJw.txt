My husband and I heard that they had 50% off on Tuesdays for Vegas industry locals, so we decided to give it a try. HOLY MOLEY. 

We had the pork belly tacos and pollo a las brasas, as recommended by our waiter, and I have absolutely no complaints. We also had micheladas and I had a cocktail, which were absolutely delicious and had incredible flavored salts on the rims. So good. 

We also had endless chips with salsa for $1.75!!! Come on, people. My husband and I agree they're the best chips of our life... And we like tortilla chips. 

We had an amazing waiter- Bryant. I will literally call to see if he's working next time because I liked him that much. Maybe it's the tequila, but we really appreciated the hospitality. 

We got $66 and we got it for $33. It's a great date night place for west siders, especially if you're on a budget. Don't listen to the haters! This place is DELICIOUS. 

P.S.- Bryant, you're the man.
