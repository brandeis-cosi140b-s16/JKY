The best chile con queso outside of Texas! I always get the Border Chimichanga with black beans. 

The staff is pretty knowledgeable about what is and isn't vegetarian, some more than others. For my boyfriend's birthday, we went with a large group (meat eaters, vegetarians, and vegans), and the manager was able to tell us what was and wasn't cooked in lard, what was and wasn't vegan, and basically, how everything was made (aside from the chips, which are sent to them bagged). 

Some of the best Mexican food I had was while I was in Austin, TX, and when my friends from ATX came here, I took them to Nando's and they LOVED it. They said it was some of the best queso they'd ever eaten, and I think that is a great feat. 

My boyfriend and I go here often. Even though it is out of our normal few miles of regular dining, we make an exception for their huge portions and delicious food! it's a little pricy, but totally worth it!
