Recommended by teaching colleagues from a school nearby. They know their salsa. I've been knocking around the SW and Mejico for some 50 years looking for el taco ultimo. Popo definitely enters the conversation. They close the conversation on the best tostada. The reason: great frijoles, fresh produce and that great salsa. Of course you know to augment the tostada with shovels of chips and salsa. Si, Si.
