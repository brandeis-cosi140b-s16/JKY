Best cheap eats in LV.  I'm from Canada and $2 for an unbelieveably tasty taco, well that's like stealing.
Adobada - my favourite.  Great as they present it or with slices of pineapple ( gotta ask for it )
Tripe - Excellent.  Not hat I expected but really good.
Tongue - also Very Good.
Brain - tasty but not my favourite
Atmosphere - lots of locals and hispanics, always a good sign
