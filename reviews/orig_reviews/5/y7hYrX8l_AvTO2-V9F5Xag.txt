OK, confession time, here's how my last few trips to Phoenix have gone...

Local Client:  Hey buddy, your flight gotten in yet?
Me (Scarfing Carolina's within minutes of landing):  NOM NOM, just arrived...NOM NOM...20 minutes ago...NOM NOM..."Order 1536! 1536!"
Local Client:  Why does it sound like you're eating burritos in the barrio?

I love, love this place.  I look forward to the fresh tortillas and amazing burritos almost as much as the Phoenix weather in the winter.  My hands down favorites are the green chile burro and chorizo potato burro, but I'd probably take anything they threw my way.  My coworker tried one red chile beef and one machaca and couldn't stop raving about them to anyone who would listen.  And to think he looked at me like I was crazy when we first rolled up to a cement building in the 'hood for a quick business lunch!

For those who might be put off by the location / atmosphere I say: live a little.   Nothing is going to happen to you, except you'll witness business guys in suits, blue collar workers, and neighborhood families alike enjoying the most mind-blowing burritos they've ever had.
