I've been coming to The Stand pretty regularly since they opened last year. It's simple food, prepared expertly, with great attention to detail. The owners are almost always present, and when they're not, everything is still smooth. The staff is friendly and helpful and on the ball. It must be a great place to work too, because there is surprisingly low turnover for a restaurant, and staff members always seem to be moving fast and enjoying themselves. The thing I like most about The Stand is, even though they got busy and popular right away, they have not become complacent. I'm there often enough to notice that they continue to fine tune their food and operations, tweaking cook times and chop-thicknesses and packaging materials ... settling for nothing less than perfection. In fact, I'm going to get myself a burger right now. And a shortrib taco. Jealous?
