Since I'm personal friends with the people of this place, I'll write my review strictly about the facts.

The place is super cool and with an amazing patio. 

The massive bar is awesome and pretty comfortable furniture.

Also since I'm a Mexican food expert (or at least I think so) the guacamole is by far the closest to the real thing that you can find in AZ and the salsas are super tasty.

They also have a Mega Margarita that is great for sharing (you know, sharing is caring).

Besides my friendship with this guys, I seriously think this is a great addition to the area!

Cheers

PS The bathrooms are spacious and they have a mirror, so you can check your smile without having to worry about embarrassment (to make sure there's no guacamole in your teeth)
