Although I'm from the midwest, I consider myself well traveled. This was the best Mexican I've ever had. You know you are off to a good start when the salsa is amazing. They gave a complementary salmon ceviche as well to start. I ordered the fish with two sauces, half cilantro sauce the other half chipotle sauce. Huge portion. The fish was fried and cooked to perfection. With my one night in Phoenix I'm so happy I went here.
