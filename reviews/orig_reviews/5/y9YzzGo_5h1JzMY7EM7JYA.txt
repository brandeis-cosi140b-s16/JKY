I have been coming to Arriba'S since it opened.  Their food and drinks are consistently amazing.  Amber and Jordan at the hostess desk are always nice and friendly.  A manager Chris or Oogin always stops by my table and asks if everything is OK.  Hector, Logan and Anthony at the bar chit chat and always make me feel welcome.  Even the bussers Isabella and Angelica are always so nice.  Great atmosphere and clean. The food and drinks are so good. They have a good happy hour with 99 cent Margaritas and half off appetizers that always keeps me coming back for more.  These are the reasons this restaurant is my favorite.-Brenda
