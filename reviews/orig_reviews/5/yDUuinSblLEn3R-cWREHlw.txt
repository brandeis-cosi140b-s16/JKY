This place was our first restaurant experience in Vegas on our vacation and if have to say it was a great choice!!! This place has a very relaxed, high end dining experience. The food is delicious, flavors I've never tasted before in Mexican food.

I highly recommend this place as one of your stops in Vegas!!
