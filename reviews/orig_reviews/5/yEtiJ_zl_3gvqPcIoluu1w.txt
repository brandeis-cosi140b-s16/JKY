I regret not visiting the LA Border Grills when I lived there because I'd be there weekly. After the previous night's disappointment at Fleur we decided to try something a smidge more casual and Border Grill ended up being our first choice. Why is it great where Fleur failed? 

1) The food is actually cooked well and didn't confuse salt and fat with flavor. Seasoning on everything was perfect from the chips through to the desserts. The food all had nuance, even the steak which is usually one of the more boring things on the menu was seasoned spectacularly well. The accompanying quesadilla would have been a great appetizer in its own right. I don't think it's possible to go wrong on this menu.

2) The service gives a shit. Our server was awesome, he steered us in the right direction on recommendations, telling us what he wouldn't order, and why, and making sure that everything was there when we needed it. At one point we needed a spare steak knife and didn't need to flag someone down, it just appeared as if by magic. Everyone we interacted with was awesome, and they got the pacing perfect. We never waited for anything but we also never felt rushed.

3) Casual is, well, casual. Border Grill manages to do a bit upscale without being stuffy. This is just an easy restaurant to be in. The energy is great throughout and the patio is a great place to be, overlooking the pool at the Mandalay Bay and it was even comfortable in the beginning of summer. Nothing is forced.

4) The drinks are great. There's a bunch of different spins on Margaritas on the menu and they're all worth drinking and all perfect for summer. Order anything from the cocktail menu with confidence. It's all great.

Some restaurants have great food but the service is off, or they have great service but the food leaves something to be desired. Or there's great food and service, but the bar is weak. Border Grill is one of the few restaurants that hits on all cylinders.
