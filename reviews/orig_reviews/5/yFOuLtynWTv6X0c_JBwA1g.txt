Just amazing food, fully customizable, and immensely satisfying. Check Yelp or Groupon for deals. My first time arriving here, the super friendly staff asked if I'd been there before, and gave me samples of their meats, and each was delicious, super flavorful, and unique tasting. This isn't your typical grilled chicken or steak, it's got FLAVOR! The Kalua pig was sweet and savory, probably the best pork I'd ever had. Definitely going back!
