My family and I love this place! Great service, great food, and a causal atmosphere. It's the best Mexican food in town. A previous review said they only serve Tabasco as salsa, that's completely false, they serve fresh homemade pico and a spicier sauce if you want something hot :) it's really yummy to mix the two :) We go just about every week, the prices are reasonable especially for the quality you get. They get busy during the spring because people are on the patio enjoying the weather, but it's worth the wait!
