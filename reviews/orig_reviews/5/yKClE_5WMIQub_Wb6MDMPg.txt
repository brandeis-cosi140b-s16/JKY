I'll be honest, I know a few of the people at Loco and have hung out there from time to time due to the awesome patio, location and crowd in general, but I was never a huge fan of the food, always thought it was so so. That all changed last night when I deviated from my normal Taco Tues spot and tried Loco's. These were seriously some of the best tacos I have ever had, the pork, the mahi, the chicken, all awesome! My new favorite Taco Tues place! As well, they have added more taps and more craft beers so its even more of what I love! Thanks Loco!
