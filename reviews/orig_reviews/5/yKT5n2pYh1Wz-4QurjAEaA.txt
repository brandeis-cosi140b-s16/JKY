I came here the other day with a couple of friends to celebrate my friend's birthday. They have a solid margarita and I LOVE the Grilled Chicken Torta. Even though everything else on the menu looks good and my friend always gets the fajitas because he swears that's the best dish, I just keep getting the same thing. It gives me the illusion that I'm eating something healthy because it's grilled chicken and a salad (maybe it is healthy?), but it's also super flavorful. It comes with a chipotle aioli sauce, as well as a cilantro dressing, and they both go well with the dish (and together). We also got a Mexican Chocolate Brownie that was tasty. It was warm and we got it with a scoop of ice cream on top -- so good.

The service was quite good. I say this because my friend signed up to get a free birthday entree, but since he was born on a leap year, he never got an email with his free birthday entree. We told our server though and she was able to arrange for him to get his complimentary entree!
