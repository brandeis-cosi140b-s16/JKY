Lives up to the hype....



We had combo chow fun (thick noodles with shrimp, chicken and beef) excellent flavor, the sauce coated the noodles perfectly without being too greasy

My favorite? The pork fusion tacos, ordered 2 of each meat (pork, beef and chicken) husband and I agree... Pork definitely outstanding of the three, will just order pork next time.  

Ordered a Mexican coke with this, perfect

Only drawback? That this isn't closer to 
my home


Will definitely return!!
