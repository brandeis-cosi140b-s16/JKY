I'm no stranger to Mexican Food. I have never been as compelled as I am now to post a review just 15 minutes after finishing a meal. 

Tacos are everywhere in this town. 

You can go to gallo blanco and get the worst service ever and have a good taco. Or you could go to joyride where they wish they were gallo blanco or just be an Arcadia yuppie who comes to central phx and thinks taco guild is just the coolest ever...

Or instead just give Santos Lucha Libre a try. 

I won't go as far to say don't bother eating here, like someone else may have...Food is super personal and everyone appreciates different flavors for different reasons.

For $7 for 5 tacos, it's dirt cheap anyway so if you're curious, check it out for yourself. Maybe it's just my controlling side which appreciates the opportunity to dictate my perfect taco combinations. I love when I can take full advantage of a salsa bar too. 

Barbacoa, green chile, and al pastor were the meats I chose for tacos, one of the harder food decisions I've had to make recently. Green chile was delicious and topping it with the salsa verde was just perfect. Barbacoa was really good too. The crunch of the pickled onions and perfectly shredded cabbage made me lose my mind just a little bit.
