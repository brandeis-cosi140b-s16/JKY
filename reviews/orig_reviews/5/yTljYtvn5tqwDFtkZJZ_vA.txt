This place is awesome! Great mix between Asian & Mexican!

When you first walk in it has a great cushion decor & feel. It's neat just to look around at the various decorations.

We tried a flight of tequilas & their margarita- both were delicious! Super recommend their Salt Air Margarita!

My hubby had the Rou Jai Mo Street Sandwich & it was DELICIOUS!

I had the carnitas & cochinita tacos both were super delicious! We shared the chips & salsa & those were yummy too.

Service was great also! Our waitress was nice & prompt! We highly recommend this place. It's 100000 time better than the gross buffet!
