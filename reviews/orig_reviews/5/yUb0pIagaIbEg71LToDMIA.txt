I was raised in Albuquerque and it's rare to find green/red chile here in Las Vegas. The food is GREAT and the customer service is amazing! Amy always greets me with a smile and a friendly hello. They pay attention to my custom orders and they are always willing to do the right thing! I live only a few blocks away so I feel very lucky to have this "taste of New Mexico" restaurant so close to me! So everyone from NM that hasn't tried it yet, please support!!!!
