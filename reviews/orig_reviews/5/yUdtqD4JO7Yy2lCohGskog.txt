The service was quick and the server knew the menu so was able to give a few great recommendations.  Drinks came out immediately and the food soon after.  I had the perfect wave margarita and was to par. The atmosphere is very casual and laid back, there is noise but not overwhelming. But most important is the food was amazing. Best taco every.  I had the grilled lemon shrimp and the tavarua fish taco.  AMAZING.  Happy. And full.
