First time to Chayo and our entire group was very satisfied! Service was great and the food was FABULOUS!  There were 6 of us and we got food to share.  At any Mexican restaurant I always judge how my meal will be based on the Chips and Salsa...and from then on I knew the food would be great! Great tasting salsa, and the guacamole with pomegranate seeds was delish!  We ordered different tacos and tostadas to share and the ingredients were fresh and overall super tasty! My favorite, which was something I have never had before was the cilantro cream soup- a must try if you go! Oh and I can't forget the great drinks - awesome twists on the classics!  Ambience  and vibe for a Thursday night was on point!  I really loved the decor too!  Only thing I regret is wearing a dress so I couldn't ride the bull (even though the operator said he would be easy on us).  Great place, next time you are visiting the LINQ stop by Chayo - you won't regret it!
