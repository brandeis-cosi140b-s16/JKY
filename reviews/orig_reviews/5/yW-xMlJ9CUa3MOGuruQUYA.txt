Every time I go to Vegas, Gonzalez y Gonzalez is a must visit for me. I love their food, for a Mexican restaurant they have some of the best wings I've had. My absolute favorite is latin night. I love coming here and dancing my heart out until they close. They play awesome music and people who love to dance should definitely check this place out. Looking forward to my next Vegas trip and visiting them again.
