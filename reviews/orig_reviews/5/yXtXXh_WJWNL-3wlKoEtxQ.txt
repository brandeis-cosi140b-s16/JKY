Jaburrito for lunch! Burrito size sushi rolls at affordable prices, yes please!!! Just discovered one of my new favorite places :) ordered the long beach burrito with seaweed wrap it has spicy tuna, shrimp tempura, surimi crab, romaine lettuce, cucumber(I ordered no cucumbers),tortilla strips, guacamole, chipotle mayo, sweet anguilla sauce. So healthy & divine. All my sushi lovers out there, you have to check this place out.
