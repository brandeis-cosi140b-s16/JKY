One of our fave new spots in the 'burgh!!!

We just moved here from Southern CA (I was born here, but the husband is Cali through and through), so we have been searching high and low for an authentic mexican joint. I have been pretty nervous for him and the lack of familarity that he may experience, but we definately found a home here. The vintage wallpaper, artsy decor and screen projector is very reminesent of a Silverlake eatery-- the music is usually pretty great too. 

I know that some people are not into the fact that thet don't take reservations (the place is usually packed), but it is worth the wait.  I threw the husband's 31st b-day here and, after emailing with the owner who is also a SoCal native, they tried their best to accomodate us despite the no-rez policy. 

The happy hour specials are incredible. I have not had such an authentic mexi-cali taco with the cabbage, radish and crema anywhere else around. The drinks are fun (try the Sham-Diego), and there is usually some hilarious Mexican wrestling match on the screen.  It is the perfect spot to chat with friends, eat and chill after the daily grind of work. Oh, and the chips are magical.

Thank you Cantina!
