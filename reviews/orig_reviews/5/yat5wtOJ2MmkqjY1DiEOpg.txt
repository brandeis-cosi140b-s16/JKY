My new favorite restaurant. The staff is very friendly and the restaurant is very clean. I had the dbl monster boyger and chencho fries. It was so good I had a food coma. The boyger was huge and had lots of flavor. The fries were amazing. The green sauce didn't overwhelm the fries or anything. I will return soon to Fat Boy and I totally recommend it to everyone.
