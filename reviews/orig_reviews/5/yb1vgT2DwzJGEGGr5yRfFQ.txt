i ate here while on business 4/17/2012.  My experience from start to finish was excellent. We started with 3 margueritas that had wonderful lime flavor. the quacamole was excellent. I had a diablo pork chop for dinner that was cooked to perfection. we followed it up by sharing churros and fried bananas for dessert.

If you're expecting tacos and burritos this is not the restaurant for you. if you want a wonderful delight of mexican modern in a fantastic atmosphere then this is your place.

I do think it was a little pricey but perhaps on a relative "vegas" scale it deserves $$$. You can certainly pay a lot more for inferior food in vegas.

Oh, I should add that our waiter was excellent. perfectly trained and very attentive.
