My friend and I came in here mid week so it was really slow and we were seated right away.  We ordered Margaritas (which were pretty pricey at around $12.00 if I remember correctly) but one is all you need for a good buzz!  We each ordered a soup and a quesadilla.  WOW!!!  Both were off the charts good.  The service was so nice and friendly we had such a good time.  I would be back for sure...even if it is expensive!
