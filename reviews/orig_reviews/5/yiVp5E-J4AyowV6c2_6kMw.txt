This is my favorite Mexican restaurant in town. So many reasons - and every time the hubby wants to go to the Other Decent Mexican place, I have to run through my list!

1. The best chips in Madison- are freshly fried and served with 2 homemade salsas, spicy chipoltle and avocado/salsa verde. These are brought out right away. (we have never waited longer than 1 minute.)

2. The margaritas are made with real lime juice and are delicious!

3. They have Negro Modelo on tap, most nights.

4. The chef KNOWS what he is doing in the kitchen. He cares and this is shown with the way he plates his food and the general freshness and attention to flavors. The guacamole is fantastic. The cochinita pibil is Amazing. The steak ranchero is perfectly cooked. And the lamb chops!!! The fish tacos are very good. All the other tacos are great too.

After 3 years of eating here, we finally met Chef Antonio because we go crazy about the lamb chops special. This is only available sometimes on Wednesdays and only if you ask for it. :) (OK, now I have let the cat out of the bag)

But You can have chicken enchiladas if you want.
