Oh my goodness this place has delicious food!! Went with coworkers for lunch for the first and I'm going become a regular. We went early, 11:00 am and it was nearly full by 11:30. Just walk in and grab a table or booth. Service is prompt and friendly. I wish I could remember our server's name. She was pleasant and attentive without overdoing it. 
I had green chile pork burro enchilada style with green sauce. Holy delicious!! Ate that whole thing and wanted to lick the plate but I showed restraint since I was in public! Can't wait to try other menu items!!!
