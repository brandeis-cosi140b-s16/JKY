This place is heaven! Hawaiian/Mexican fusion. Friendly crew. Gave us samples to test since it was our first time. They did not disappoint! Way, way better than Chipotle! In-house made sauces are to die for! Pig was the best. Generous serving sizes for the price. Definitely will go back here again, despite the long drive. Truly worth your time and money.
