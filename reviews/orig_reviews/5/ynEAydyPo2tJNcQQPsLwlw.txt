I love this location because these folks already know who I am and always get my order right! But, if anything I would have to give kudos to a specific employee named jasmine! This girl is the sweetest employee I've ever came across! The rest of the staff is as well but jasmine has never failed to take good care of me every single time I go in she's amazing! (:
