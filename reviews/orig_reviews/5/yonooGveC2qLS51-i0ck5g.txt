AMAZING!  I went for lunch and got the 2 enchiladas.  One with green chili pork and the other with short rib.  Since I was a little overwhelmed with all the choices, and indecisive, I asked the person making it to top it with whatever went best, and that's just what he did.  I can't tell which one I liked better because they were both really good.  All I can tell you is, I will be back!
