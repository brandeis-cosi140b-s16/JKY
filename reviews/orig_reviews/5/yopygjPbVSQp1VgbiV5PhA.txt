We love this place.  We first found Los Dos Molinos off of Central and Baseline.  When we moved to Ahwatukee, we were so excited to have a location within less than 1 mile from our house. family owned and operated.  Good service and food is excellent.  And let me tell you about the Margarita!!  You do not know the damage until you have finished the first round. A family favorite.  We are moving and are going to miss you!!!  Muchos Gracias for the memories Los Dos Molinos!!
