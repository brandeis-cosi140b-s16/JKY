Server was so friendly, and actually engaged in conversation. The food was great, and my scorpion shot went down so smoothly. I asked for the biggest scorpion they had, and they delivered. I would like to personally thank Zach (our server) for being super attentive, and just all around a great server. Will definitely come back. And most definitely will recommend to all of my friends. Thank you Nacho Daddy for turning around a bad day with your awesomeness.
