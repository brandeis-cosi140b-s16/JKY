this place was great. we wandered in one night in search of some good Mexican food. haven't had a lot of luck in Vegas.
chips and salsa and hot bean dip yum! we ordered combo plates. everything was very tasty. chile rellenos were awesome. no seeds!  
loved the chicken enchiladas too. whole list of different salsas numbered for hotness. husband tried the top 3. 10 was crazy burn your taste buds off with no flavor but other than that they had their own unique flavors. highly recommend trying a few. you get little cups to sample and can purchase the larger size. we bought some to take home. was a nice clean atmosphere. servers were all extremely personable and helpful. nice chill feel. not loud and you don't feel rushed. also found they have nice bar area where you can eat too. went with my husband and three year old. noticed they sat us in the back area way from the quieter diners and instead with other kids which was refreshing.  will be back again soon. really enjoyed it.
