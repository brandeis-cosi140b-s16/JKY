Just finished eating here. this place looks classy even if it is a little small. service was great. I had the enchiladas verdes & my guest ordered the Enmoladas. My plate was delicious, the right amount of spicy & tasted very authentic. The enmoladas were good too, were more on the sweeter side, but savory. Yes portions are on the smaller side but the food/taste really made up for it.  We then had their flan for dessert and oh man it's exactly what flan should taste like. This place is so delicious I will definitely return for dinner (they offer different menus and more selection) .
