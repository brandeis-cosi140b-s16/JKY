I cannot stop thinking about the Al Pastor and the Elote (Mexican Corn) !!!

Hands down best Mexican food I've had so far! And so close to home!!! 

Their menu is huge!
You get to choose if you want burritos, tacos, nachos, fries, bowls.. Then they have 12 kinds of meat to choose from and they have veggie toppings, ie soyrizo (soy chorizo).. Variety of toppings.. And a big side and sauces bar.. I mean can you ask for more?!

I had the Al Pastor nachos with an Elote.
The meat was tender, toppings (guacamole, sour cream, pinto beans, cheese) were fresh and homemade, and the nachos were crisp!
Meat to toppings to chips ratio was good!

I know it's just corn but their Elote was sooooo good !!! I don't know how such a simple thing can pack so much flavor!! 

I wish I would've gone for the $2 tacos to try different meats like the carne asada or carnitas .. but now this only means I HAVE to go back!!!
