Having been here just over a half-dozen times, maybe it's time to write a review to let you good folks know why I choose to come back here more frequently than any of the many other, independent-ish, hip and tasty restaurants in the downtown Phoenix area.  

I'm not going to spend time talking about the awesome look and feel of having a restaurant in a re-purposed old church, complete with stained glass windows, beautiful open-beam ceilings and...and I digress.

Food.  More specifically, tacos.  Amazing tacos with unique and wonderful flavors.  When was the last time you had a lamb or duck taco?  On house-made tortillas?  With the exception of the vegetable taco (seriously?), I've had them all.  My 4 consistently awesome, favorites are: Chipotle Cherry Steak, Pork Adovada, Al Pastor Pork & Urban Bean Coffee Braised Beef.  In that order.  

I'm told that the the Street Corn is not-to-be-missed, but I've missed it so far.  I'll get it eventually.  The guac is absolutely terrific, and the the four salsas with the complimentary chips are very flavorful, no doubt due in no small part to the use of fresh, locally grown produce.  

And finally, the sides.  All are good, but on my visit Thursday, the Borracho Red Beans were different than they've been in the past, and as long as they stay this way, they will be the only side I consider from here on out.  Whatever the change, keep it!

I'm tired of typing, and if you made it this far, you're tired of reading.  Check out the Taco Guild, take your friends.  Do it after work and sample the tequila bar too.
