This place is excellent. I never knew about this hole in the wall until family came into town. The service was phenomenal and the food was delicious. 
The free chips and bean dip were made in house and you can clearly tell. We opted for the beef fajitas that they cooked at tableside.  I didn't expect it to have so much flavor and to be so juicy. It reminded me of backyard barbecues my sister had in L.A.  The tortillas and even the rice were so savory and hot.  I liked how attentive the staff was even though it was a full house and they still were able to tend to our party of 12. 
This place knows how to really keep customers happy. We plan on going here with the local fams as well.
