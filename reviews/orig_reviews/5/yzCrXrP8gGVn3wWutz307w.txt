The Countess, she is beautiful, she is talented, she is delightful and she is bountiful, she is saucy (in the "salsa" sense of the word, not the "descarado" sense of the word:)...she's also cheap:)

But then again, so am I:)

It's Taco Tuesday (as I write this...who knows when I'll finish it and post it...maybe next Taco Tuesday...maybe not:)

But today, I needed to retox after my run along the mighty Scottsdale River (or the Crosscut Canal as the flatlanders refer to it:)

I was going to wander over to Cien Agave, when my buddy called and said he'd gotten done with an open heart surgery early (usually, that's a very bad sign, but not today...he said everything went "swimmingly":) but after 12 hours of holding someone's life in his hands, he too was in need of a retox:)

We agreed that it was time to go see The Countess:)

I've seen a bunch of glowing reviews on good ol' Yelp and as I always do when I read the praise heaped on a particular place by my Yelp brethren and sistren, I thought "I'll be the judge of that!":)

Not that I don't trust the reviews...I do, or I wouldn't have jumped in the rig, pulled the belts tight and lit the turbocharger in order to get my retox going:)

No..."trust, but verify"...those words were given to all of us during an episode of Death Valley Days by a nearly washed up actor (whose name escapes me at the moment)...

Well, it's all true enough...the black mole chicken is subtle but spicy...the cochinita is saucy and inviting...the dog shark taco may be made with the only fish that travels well to the desert (no, don't get too excited...not the best fish taco I ever had...but very good:)

And more than enough to eat from an inexpensive platter of softball sized tacos (I know, I called The Countess "cheap" a few paragraphs ago, but what I meant was a solid value:)...Two big, round, tumescent taco's with rice and frijoles'...$7.59, USD:)

And plenty of salsa...oh yes...lots and lots of salsa...saucy, saucy salsa:)

None of the legendary "strawberry salsa" today (probably like the Yeti...plenty of sightings, but no actual evidence:)...but I didn't care...they still had a dozen salsas to choose from:)

And all the salsas seemed to complement my taco's...how is it even possible that Peanut Salsa and Smokey Chipotle Salsa BOTH taste exquisite with the moles and the pork shoulder?

I don't know...I asked my buddy...he's a trained physician and he didn't know either (so what good is he?...unless I need a heart transplant and then, you know...he's a god:)

As I contemplated all of the fresh and interesting selections available at the salsa bar, I thought to myself "well, it's a bar, why don't I just pull up a chair and make a day of it?" :-)

After The Countess herself came out and asked me to please eat at my own table and quit embarrassing myself and my lunch buddies, I remembered that this kind of thing is what got me banned from the Top of the Mark in San Francisco (although I will tell you what I told the SFPD...having a Caviar Bar with bar stools in close proximity is just asking for it:)

We finished our delightful lunch without further incident and agreed that this place should be much closer to our respective homes and open 24/7 so we can walk over and grab a burro or a platter of tacos whenever we feel like it...which would be pretty much every day, for at least 2 meals:)

Do you think The Countess will go for that?
