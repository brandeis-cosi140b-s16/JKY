This play deserves this 5! Service was great from the start. Chips (fresh made) and salsa at the table so so good. Powerfruit mojito delicious and my pescado tacos along with my husband's enchilades vera cruz were all exceptional! Our server Sundae (yes that's her name and aptly so) was great and able to roll with our style of humor. We will definitely be back. I mean after all we have to try the happy and brunch. That's only fair.
