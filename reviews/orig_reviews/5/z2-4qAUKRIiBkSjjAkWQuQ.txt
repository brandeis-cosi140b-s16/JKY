Service was great. I stopped by for a late afternoon drink and appetizer during some shopping at Mandalay Bay. The server was most attentive and accommodating and the patio atmosphere was wonderful. I took his recommendation on the blood orange margarita and was definitely not disappointed! Must try if you like a little spice in your drink. The guacamole was fresh and made to order with my request of no onions. I certainly plan on coming back to enjoy a meal!
