I found my spot!! I eat fish tacos/ street tacos and nachos across the U.S. and never have I seen a Taqueria set up like a Subway. Choose my toppings for my tacos and nachos? I don't mind if I do, thank you. 

Chipotle? Nah that's a burrito joint and I don't do burritos. Man this Tokyo Drift movie is corny AF. I can't believe they made 7 of these POS. Sorry, laying down on the couch knocked out from the 5 street fish tacos and 1/2 a nacho. Next week I'm just doing the 5 tacos or just the Super Nacho. The service was fast and friendly and the sauces were fantastic. 5 stars no doubt. I gotta try and get up and change the channel. Tough tho. Taco Coma.
