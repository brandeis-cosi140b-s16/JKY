Best service in town, hands down!  The waiter got to us as soon as we sat down outside and his timing was perfect and non intrusive during our whole meal.  The menu is pretty simple, but it has the classic taco or burrito that you can customize.  You have to pay $1.75 for chips and salsa, but honestly it was one of my favorite salsas I've ever had.  It kind of reminded me of Macayo's, but a tad spicier... it was very flavorful, which I love.
