So I think I am a taco addict. But no need for intervention.... I come here quite often and every time it is just wonderful! I am almost embarrassed to go here because I think the people who work here remember me.... but that can't keep me away from the taco goodness. 

So the carne asada is wonderful, but I have found it to be much more wonderful on the vampiro. The vampiro is a masterpiece. It is like a tostada, in that it has a crunchy tortilla as a base. Then it is topped with caramelized onion, lettuce, guac, Carne asada, and maybe cilantro or something? Add some extra spicy salsa and I am a very happy girl. 

In addition, I was scared to try the al pastor for awhile, and then I tried it and realized the wonder of their pork. Wow. It is good. They have it on a rotating stick, almost like gyro meat, with a chunk of pineapple on top... with the pineapple juice just dripping onto the pork. One time we went and they were out of pork and I almost cried. No joke. It is that good. I get it on a taco, which has a slice of the pineapple (best topping), guac, onion, and cilantro. super yum. 

The extra spicy salsa is really good. It is the perfect amount of spicy to make my nose run a little. It also tastes incredibly fresh, like everything here. 

This is the kind of place where I tell a friend I went here and they are sad that I didn't bring them....So go here.... Go here right now!
