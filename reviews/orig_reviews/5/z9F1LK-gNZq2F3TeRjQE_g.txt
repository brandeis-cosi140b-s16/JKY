We went here on our last night in Vegas. I'm always worried that the food inside the hotel is going to be sub par, but they did not disappoint here. We were greeted by the host and seated promptly. It was Sunday evening and it wasn't too busy, but it was also only 5:45pm. We had a show at 7pm so we wanted to get food in before the show. My husband had the three enchiladas with different types of meats and sauces. I had the cheese enchiladas with red sauce, with refried beans and rice, upon recommendation of our server. It had a nice little kick to it, but not overly spicy. It was delicious! The server also gave me a mocktail (I'm pregnant) which was fresh and fruity. It tasted like a smoothie than a mocktail but I was happy regardless. Food and drinks came out quickly and they also had an excellent drink list. My husband had the herradura tequila, one of his favorites. Altogether, great service and great food. Perfect for dates or just a nice meal with the family.
