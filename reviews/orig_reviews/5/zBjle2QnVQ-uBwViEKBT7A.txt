The most authentic mexican food around.  The carne asada is amazing and their guacamole is always fresh.  I do feel completely gross and unhealthy after leaving but that's why Los Tacos is an occasional treat.
 
The staff is bilingual so you don't have to speak spanish to order with confidence like some places around town.. *cough* Robertos *cough*.
 
Love this place!
