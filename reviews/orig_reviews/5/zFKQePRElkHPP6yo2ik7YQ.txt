This was a nice treat to find in this area. As an out of towner it was really nice to find a non-chain restaurant.  I have to say this is one of the best burgers i have ever had. And what makes it is the pickled red onion and the mix of cheese i got on the bacon cheeseburger. We also got the sweet potato tots and they were delicious. Owner is a super nice guy as well!  Go here you wont regret it.
