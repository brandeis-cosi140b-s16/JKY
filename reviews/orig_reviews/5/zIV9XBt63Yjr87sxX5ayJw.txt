If you want the usual Mexican fare with lots of lard and cheddar cheese, don't go here. Si Senors delivers that style wonderfully (which I would also give 5 stars!)
Restaurant Mexico delivers a lighter version that is incredibly tasty. I like their simple green enchilada plate. A light tasty green sauce. A light white cheese. The refried beans are great - not the whipped variety that you find at other places. Their chips and salsa are ... just ... different and good.
You go away not with a bloated feeling, but with the taste sensation still lingering on your palate. 
I have been going to Restaurant Mexico off and on for 30 years - at their first place on Mill, then off of Mill, and now back on Mill. I hope they are around for 30 more.
Thankfully they have preserved the recipe for all of these years!
