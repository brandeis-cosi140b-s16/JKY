This restaurant is attached to a strip club but you do not have to go through the strip club to eat here. Aside from that, the main reason I wanted to eat here was because they service all organic, GMO-free foods. I had the chicken enchiladas and my boyfriend had the al pastor tacos. The food was perfectly made and not too salty which I am pretty picky about. I did the Yelp check-in and got the free flan, and the chef came out to talk to us which I thought was pretty special. The service was really great and the complimentary chips and salsa is so delicious. This is definitely one of my new favorite sit down Mexican restaurants.
