I have now been to La Ristra twice, and both times the food has been amazing. The chips and salsa is some of the best I've ever had, especially the green salsa. The house margarita is good, and last night I had some of the papas bravas from the appetizer menu- the description didn't sound too appealing to me, but they were great! 

As for my entree- last time, I got the farmer's burrito chimi style. I asked to get pinto & black beans instead of meat, which they had no trouble accommodating. The portion size is HUGE- it fed me for three meals total. Last night, I got the blue corn enchiladas, stacked with an egg on top, with adovada pork. The pork is incredible- perfectly tender and such good flavor. 

It's a new restaurant, and I think they still have some kinks to work out, but overall I really love this place and can't wait to go back.
