so many times driving by this place.....and each time thinking this place seems silly...who would have a giant face on the front of thier business staring down motorists?

I guess when your food is that ridiculously good, go ahead and post whatever you want on your business!!

My recomendation for this place is not only because it is huge, has a beautiful interior and super friendly staff--no, no--the food is damn good.

I went for breakfast and ordered a pork machaca (an egg scramble) which came with rice, beans and freshly made tortillas along with a larger than life horchata for around $10. 

My significant other had the Huevos con Chorizo...and that too was dynamite.

I know I'll return to Henderson in September and will definitely stop by this place again for my Mexican fix!!
