This is my wife's and my favorite place to eat in Scottsdale. The skinny margaritas are very good and the pork nachos are amazing. We recently split an order of tacos, she had chicken while I had the shrimp. The care given to the meat in everything we had was appreciated as it seems that the they marinate everything for a few days beforehand, very tender and tasty. 

We used to visit the origanum location by the Boulders resort and just happened to notice this one closer to Scottsdale. We were pleasantly surprised to see our favorite bartender waiting for us when we arrived during our annual sojourn to the Phoenix area. 

The new location is much larger and loses a bit of the charm of the original spot. However, the ambience is both relaxing and easy on the senses. 

Fantastic place to eat and drink.
