Great place to see both national and local acts. Live music most nights. DJ's too. 

When you walk up to the place you'll see the outdoor sitting area. When you first walk inside you'll be in the smaller stage area with tables, a full bar, and a TV or two.

Further in is where the larger stage is.

My friend plays here and her band gets paid decently. You have to appreciate a venue that pays musicians for their talent and the crowd they bring in. If you have ever been to NY or LA you know many venues have a "pay to play" system. Not cool.

Food is good and decently priced. Most beers on tap. Decent options for drinks and wine.

Great place to experience downtown Phoenix's music scene. Yes we have a music scene. It's just completed spread out across the metropolitan area we call home.
