My husband and i came here for our 1 year anniversary. Our server was Jorge, he was on top of everything from our drinks to our main meal. I ordered the pork tamales and my husband ordered the beef tamales. We were not disappointed. The tamales were stuffed with tamale filling the refried beans were yummy as well as the spanish rice. Will definitely come back. I have not had as good of tamales since i moved from Texas until i came and ate at Dona Marias. Keep up the great work.
