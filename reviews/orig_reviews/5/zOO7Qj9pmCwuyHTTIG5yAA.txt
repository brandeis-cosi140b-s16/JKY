This place has the best tacos!  Given that it's set up outside of a bar, you would think it wasn't the best in the world, but they really are yummy.  It's actually set up much like a permanent food truck but they have ample picnic style seating.   This is the place to go if you want some post-clubbing snacks at a pretty reasonable price.  They even have an ordering window which is located in outside area in Charlies.
