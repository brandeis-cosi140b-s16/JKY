This place was a nice departure from the typical Mexican restaurant. A little more upscale and modern. Very fresh and delicious food!  The complimentary chips and salsa were so good. Not greasy or heavy like a lot of other Mexican restaurants. Shrimp enchiladas were very flavorful and the table side guacamole and dessert options were a fun touch. Definitely would go back again and again!
