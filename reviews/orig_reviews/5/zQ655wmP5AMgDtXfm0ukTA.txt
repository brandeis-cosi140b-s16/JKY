The food was amazing! The place has a nice decor, the staff are friendly, and they have really good, authentic, Mexican food!

We ordered their guacamole, which was really yummy. They make it table side for you and they provide a pretty well sized bowl of it.

I ordered the asada mole enchiladas, they were delicious! I was a bit nervous about ordering mole because so many restaurants mess it up, but this was perfect. The portions are pretty large and the prices are extremely reasonable. I'll definitely want to come here again. :)
