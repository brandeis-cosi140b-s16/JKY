Been wanting to try this place for a long time and finally did it!  We ordered Carne Asada and Al Pastor tacos with the chips with beans,guacamole and salsa trio.  Everything was phenomenal but my favorite was the Al Pastor and beans!  Both were sooooo good!  It's really hard to find true Al Pastor and this place does it!  

It was a bit expensive but it won't deter me from coming back.  I would rather pay a little extra for homemade, good quality food!  

Just a fair warning to the people who think this is fast food, it's not super fast.  It wasn't abnormally slow but I noticed two customers come in and were obviously agitated by the time they got their to go orders.  It was quite busy and all the food is homemade so it's not going to be super quick.  We got our food within 5 minutes and considering how busy the place was, I was happy with the time.  Good food is worth the wait!
