I came upon this place after I attempted to have food and drinks at another restaurant. Since my party and I received no service, we got the point that our business was not wanted and saw the Taco Palace. I have to say the other restaurant did me a favor as if it weren't for their horrible service, I wouldn't have checked this place out.

Well, right away we were greeted by super friendly staff. We sat in the front area and within minutes, we had drinks and ordered appetizers. The utilized the Yelp "check in offer" of free chips and salsa which was AWESOME. They have a great salsa bar that offers mild, medium, and hot salsas. We also ordered the Tubbs Nachos which were HUGE and had a lot of fresh and beautiful ingredients. 

For my main dish, I had the tilapia tacos which were out of this world and the sweet potato fries. My mom had tacos as well and a bloody mary which was one of the best that I have ever had. 

Our waitress was fast and attentive and sweet and I loved her purple hair. 

The d√©cor and the atmosphere was comfortable and inviting. The next time I am in this area, I will be eating here again!
