Authentic, Delicious, Fresh. You will wait a little while but it is worth the fresh and amazing taste. Although drinks took a while to come, the waitress let us know they were backed up. 100% amazing drinks. 100% amazing food. You won't be let down. Every single food piece, from the cinnamom on the pina colada glass rim, to the scrambbled eggs in the Torta, has an authentic  taste. I would know as my mom is from Guatemala which has some similar cooking styles of Mexico.
