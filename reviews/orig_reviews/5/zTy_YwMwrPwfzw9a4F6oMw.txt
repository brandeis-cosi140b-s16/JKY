If you're from SoCal, you're able to recognize good Mexican food when you come across it.  Phat Franks did not disappoint.  Ordered an asada burrito, an asada plate, the catota torta, and each of the desserts. Everything was spot on. My only criticism would be of the barbacoa, as it was a tad too salty for my taste buds.  I had to add extra hot sauce on it in order to soften some of the saltiness.  We had to take most of the food to go because the portions are generous.  Didn't mind that at all. We'll definitely be visiting this place again whenever we're in Vegas.
