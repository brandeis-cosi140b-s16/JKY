Yes, yes, yes! I LOVE this place! So much, I don't know where to begin.

Let's start with the food.  Latin food is my favorite.  The food is packed with flavor! Nothing that will stop my heart right away either.  And there's a perfect amount of it in the food.  I've had  enchilado de camarones and maduros.  I usually order this and pick off others plates.  My, oh my.  Never disappointed with my choices because they always taste so good.  That happy "this taste so good" chair dance usually wiggles its way out of me.  Seriously so good and packed with flavor.  All taste buds get in on this action.  When I go with other people, they love it, too. I came here for my birthday, and all guests were well fed.  The table fell silent for a while because we all were so into our plates.  Just heard forks and knives to plates.  Some had never been before and loved it.  They were also pleased with the service.

They are always super friendly! Walk in and there is someone greeting you, sometimes in spanish.  While at your tablem they always come back to check in and make sure everything is going well.  They have a bit of humor as well, which makes the experience better.

Come on the right night and they have live music and salsa! Baya! Can't go wrong with that. A portion of the restaraunt turns into a nightclub and people are movin'! Those with plenty of experience and little to none are on the floor.  I fall into the category of little experience, but I still get out there! 

You can come here eat authentic latin food, and and genuinely have an awesome time, away from the glitz & glam that is the strip.
