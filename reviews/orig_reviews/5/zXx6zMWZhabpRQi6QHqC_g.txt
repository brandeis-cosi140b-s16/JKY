Our reservation for valentine's day dinner at Border Grill wasn't perfect, but nothing that would take away from the 5 star rating. 

We ordered the guacamole and tuna ceviche appetizers, both fresh and beautifully presented. Asked ahead of time for the guacamole to be SPICY (more jalape√±os than normal) and it came out bland. Salsas for the table were good, especially the tomatillo salsa. 

I ordered the chicken chile verde enchiladas and my honey had the Yucatan pork. Both of us thought our dishes were wonderful, generous portions and almost too gorgeous to eat. Love a restaurant that ensures the freshest and organic ingredients. Handmade tortillas really made the enchilada dish. We were wow'ed. For dessert we had the Mexican chocolate pie, which was just like regular chocolate pie, couldn't taste the Mexican chocolate, but it was good. 

The only issue I had here was that I was sitting directly under a water leak (air conditioning, maybe?) and got dripped on here & there throughout the meal. Didn't want to ruin my dress! Told the waitress about it, she was non-chalant about it. Weird. 

Anyway: dinner here was a pleasure. Being local, we will be back again. We just won't sit in the leaky dining room!
