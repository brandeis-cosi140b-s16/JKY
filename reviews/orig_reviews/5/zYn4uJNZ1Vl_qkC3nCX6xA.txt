I LOVE this place!! My aunt and uncle live in Henderson, so I make sure to come here any time I visit.  This past weekend, we were in town for the Life is Beautiful festival, and Nacho Daddy had a Groupon available, so we definitely took advantage.

Kim was our server, and she was delightful! She makes genuine conversation with guests and was able to give us some good recommendations to prepare for the extreme heat that the city was experiencing at the time (10 degrees hotter than usual for this time of year). The host was very friendly and seated us immediately, and also thanked us again on our way out.

I always get the Thai Chicken Nachos and I think they are fantastic.  They have a wide variety of dishes on the menu that I haven't had the change to explore since I am so obsessed with the Thai Chicken, but I have no doubt that everything else is just as excellent.  Prices are reasonable and the portions are large.

Definitely come here for food/drinks if you're in the area! They do to-go orders as well. I'll be back any time I'm in town.
