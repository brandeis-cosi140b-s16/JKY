If you are interested in highly seasoned, unique, flavorful food, this is THE PLACE. I live in california, and every time my husband and I visit phoenix we have to stop in a couple times before we leave. 

My favorite place to eat hands down. You DO have to know what your getting yourself into though. It is FUSION, that means... KINDA WIERD on the first try stuff. Try to have an open mind.
