Z Tejas has been and always will be one of my favorites here in the valley.  First, the good is great quality and great value.  You can get a great meal for $15.  I know people knock it because it's a "smaller" chain....but don't kid yourself, some of the mom & pop shops in town are just terrible.  Second, Z has great service.  It's one of the best run resturants I've been to and I eat out a lot.

Overall, you can't go wrong with this pick for yourself or for guest.
