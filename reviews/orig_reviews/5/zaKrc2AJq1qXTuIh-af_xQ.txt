I had been wanting to try this place every time we ate over at In N Out Burger across the way. We finally got to try it the other night.  Eric and I both had the flaming fajitas.  It was good and the onion and peppers they serve with the chips and salsa were so good.  We also had the churros. Yummy.  Crunchy and sweet.
