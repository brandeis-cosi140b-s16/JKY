I've been coming here for months and this is long over due. Any local knows that the best places are often off the strip and this is no different. As far as Mexican cuisine there is not a place I've been to that is better. Chef Paco has created a menu that everyone can enjoy while still capturing the true flavors of Central American cooking. Counting in the prices and the specials that they run it's a no brainer. The ingredients for every dish are from premium organic sources and prepared by people that care. Anyone who works in the service industry will tell you some people are impossible to please and those kinds of people should just stay home..forever. Forget those grumps. If you have any common sense along with an appetite to match you better be stopping by here asap. Plus it's open 24/7. Skip the late night street meat that might give you botulism. El Dorado is a real slice of Mexican pride.
