I'm happy to say that I've incorporated Guedo's into my weekly routine.  The food is excellent and the atmosphere is spot-on. I've read several reviews where people complained about the food being overpriced but I really don't mind paying a little extra when it comes supporting local businesses; especially a staple of the community like Guedo's.  If you're looking for a place with awesome food and an owner who cares to learn your name, come to Guedo's.
