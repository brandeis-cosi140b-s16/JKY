Most everything is cooked in house making the options for dietary restrictions is easy to accommodate.  Nice selection of gluten free food. 
I live in florida and found joyride online and emailed them requesting information on gluten free options and the manager emailed me back with a very thorough and nice response. 
The staff was AMAZING, so friendly, wish I could frequent this establishment all the time!
