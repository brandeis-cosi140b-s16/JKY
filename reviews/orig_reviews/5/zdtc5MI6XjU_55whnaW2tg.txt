This place is absolutely amazing! The tacos are delicious with a wonderful salsa bar. I wanted a chicken casadilla but they did not have chicken so I got al pastor. I had never heard of it before but my goodness!! It was the best casadilla I had ever had. This is one of my main spots now. I recommend stopping in here for lunch or dinner if your ever in the area
