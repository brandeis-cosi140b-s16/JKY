Rosita's Place is a Phoenix institution. Everyone who's anyone eats here, from former governor Bruce Babbitt to nobodies like me. My father used to tease me that I was "born with a spoon of Rosita's refried beans in my mouth;" I have been eating here for 40 years, and the waitress I remember from my childhood still works here.

From their humble beginnings on Buckeye road to their "new" (they've been here quite awhile) location on McDowell Rd near 24th street, the owners of this restaurant have won more accolades for delicious home-cooked Mexican food than anywhere else in the Valley of the Sun. The huge portions of food are cheap and consistently delicious, based on family recipes. You're likely to encounter a live mariachi band on weekends. 

The red sauce is hotter than the green, but not by much - they'll both smoke your brains out of your skull. Everything is good. Keep returning until you've tried all of it. My favorites: chile relleno with rice, beans & flour tortilla, albondigas soup, carnitas plate, and the refried beans in general.

Maybe it's because I've been dining at Rosita's Place regularly for my whole life, and they know me, but I never get slow service as has been mentioned in other reviews. Also, if you think this place is in the ghetto, and you don't like that you have to park in back where you can't see your car while you eat, you're too sheltered - in case you didn't notice, there is always a paid attendant keeping an eye on the parking lot!
