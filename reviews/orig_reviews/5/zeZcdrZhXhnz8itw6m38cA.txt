My wife and I love this place. We eat here often and have yet to have a bad experience with food or service. Their Carne Adovada is outstanding and the Lobster Enchiladas are magnificent, especially the three chile sauce.  One of the things I love about this place is that they serve spicy food with a huge depth of flavor, something that is very hard to accomplish.

If you haven't been, I highly recommend checking it out. You won't be sorry, except if you have the Habenero Burger, then you might be a little sorry about half way through it...very spicy. Enjoy!  :-)
