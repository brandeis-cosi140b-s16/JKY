Excellent place. My group wanted to eat close to the strip before a night out. We were easily seated and got drinks right away. The margaritas are very tasty. We ordered table side guacamole first, which was prepared (no surprise here) table side. It was delicious and fresh. I ordered a shrimp bowl, which was so filling and also very tasty. We got a free flan for checking in on Yelp and we also ordered churros, which finished our meal beautifully. The chef came by as we were finishing and made sure everything was to our liking, which it was. Our group is from out of state, but we would definitely come back if we were in the area and I recommend it to anyone!
