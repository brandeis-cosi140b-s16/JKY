My to go to place when I'm craving for Mexican food... I love their Menudo and it's always been consistent and no after taste especially if one of the main ingredient is tripe. Their shrimp fajitas and chicharones are delisyoso! 

Everyone here are very helpful and accommodating, servers and bussers are amazing. They have their rhythm together and you know that they all work together as a team. 

Food and atmosphere are great for all ages!!! Love this place.
