Disclaimer: this is only for the bar area and drinks

Came here during the early evening hours before our dinner reservations elsewhere. Seated at the bar we ordered beers and margaritas. Service didn't not disappoint and the drinks were great. The margaritas may be on the pricier side but you get what you pay for. Quality then you don't need quantity! We'd return for drinks next time we are in the area.
