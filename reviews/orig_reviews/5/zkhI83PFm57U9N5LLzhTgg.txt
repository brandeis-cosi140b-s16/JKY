Food:  Absolutely delicious!  I have tried the Bulgogi fries, the fushion taco, burrito, and chimichanga, and the nachos.  All the food has been outstanding! The flavors are unique and dynamic.  The portions are very generous and I never leave with any room left.  Each time I go I see other people eating other dishes that look amazing, but when I go back I get the same stuff because I like it so much. I don't like that the service canned soda, it is too expensive to drink because I drink a lot; so I just get water when I go.

Service: The service is always great! They people are friendly and do a good job educating you on how they run the restaurant and what not. For example the first time I went in they welcomed me and told me thanks for trying them out. They explained that there is often a long wait and that if I am in a hurry I should call in an order on my way over.

Overall: Delicious food!  Usually a wait when I go there, but always worth the 5-20 minute waits that I encounter!
