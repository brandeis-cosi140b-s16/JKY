My new FAVORITE place!

I could not rave over this restaurant enough!
I went in on a whim because Montford Drive is close by, and decided to try it out!
The dips and chips, the street tacos, the mixed drinks- it was all incredible! They are fast, the food tastes delicious, the drink and food menu is innovative and unique, and the atmosphere is really inviting & fun!

I have come with a group of 20 and on a date, and love it all the same : )

This place ROCKS!
