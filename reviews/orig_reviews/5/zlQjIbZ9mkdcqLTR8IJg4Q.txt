If you enjoy fresh seafood and Mexican food, this is the place to go.  I have dined in this establishment multiple times and every time I walk away very impressed.  I believe they have the best ceviche in all of Phoenix.  They do several different types, and since I'm allergic to shrimp, I always get the fish ceviche.  Also the raw oysters are fresh and always on point.  It's always fresh and taste amazing.  So dishes I highly recommend are the whole fried fish, Filete de Pescado and the Molcajete is perfect for sharing.

Beautiful interior and super friendly staff.  My go to restaurant in the Phoenix area.

Must try, you wont be disappointed. Outstanding food and service.
