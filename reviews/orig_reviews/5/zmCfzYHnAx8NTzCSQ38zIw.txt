So I just want to say the manager Mark and our server Andria were absutley amazing. I ordered food and it came with something I don't like it. When I told her she asked her manager and when he came over he apologized and said he would get me more tacos. Highly recommended to come to El Hefe.


Ps. Come buy lots of bottles from Andria.
