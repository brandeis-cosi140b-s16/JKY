I enjoy coming to this and other Z-Tejas locations for their great food, good margaritas and the awesome fun bar on the weekends. The reason for this review is the great customer service I received during a recent visit to the Mill Ave location. Our party encountered a small issue with the outside chairs having some moisture on them thus resulting in a small stain on one of the clothing items. The manager, Joel was very professional about this mishap, explained what had caused it and went above and beyond to take care of the awkward situation in a very professional manner. Mistakes happen but what matters is how this restaurant's staff handled the situation.
