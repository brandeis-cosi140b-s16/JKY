After a chaotic, drawn-out airport experience with my family and first air travel for my two infant nieces, we walked a few blocks of old town and thought cien agaves made the best walk by impression. Our seating needs looked doubtful at first, but the staff quickly scrambled to accommodate our party of six adults and 2 babies. The menu is full of everything you expect for Mexican and more, mainly a large variety of specialty tacos. I mainly enjoyed local craft beers, guacamole, and tacos. Great drinks, great food, great staff.
