This place is so good. I love fish tacos and try them everywhere. This place batters and frys the fish as you order it and gives a very generous amount of fish one each taco. The best part is the topping bar where you get to choose what goes on your taco! Sauces are made in house and there are a variety of hit sauces to pick from also. Highly recommend!
