When Richardson's burned, I was crushed. The only thing that got me through the sorrow was the knowledge that Dick's had survived. The Hideaway was such a great local secret - waving to the hostess at Richardson's, walking through the kitchen and to the back entrance to an spot at Dick's always felt like I was a VIP in an exclusive group.  I no longer live in walking distance, but still make it back for their fantastic food.

Instead of reviewing the dishes (already well covered here), I'll just issue this statement - for those that can't handle spice, it may be difficult to find something truly bland here.  I love the melange, but some tender-tongues I've brought with me have been a little disappointed.

Okay, you got me - I couldn't leave without a couple food comments!  You cannot go wrong with the mixed grill special - no matter what it is.  Hell, any of the specials, really.  It's been so long since I ate from the regular menu that I just keep up to date by stealing smells and bites from my friends.  And I still love that GCP, but am one of the few that is NOT a fan of the Pasta Heidi (to me, it's just okay, you know?).

Oh, and if you could do me the favor of ignoring my five star review and never coming to this place, I'd appreciate it.  I like still coming here and having my seat available.  Thanks.
