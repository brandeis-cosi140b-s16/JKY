It's funny because I lived in Chandler for years, drove past this place tons of times and always said I wanted to try it out... never did, until last thursday.  I went back that day for dinner also... soo good.

Went with a few friends to check it out and I've gotta say it was the best shrimp taco and shrimp burrito I've probably ever had including Rocky Point.  The baja style food was so good, reminded me of being IN rocky point.

The sandy outdoor patio with the little straw umbrella cabana type tables are awesome and make you not want to go back to work while at lunch.

Only weird thing is they only take cash... They have an ATM inside that charges $2 to take money out but if you give them a receipt of your ATM transfer they'll give you a $2 coupon for your next visit - and don't worry because you'll want to go back.

It's a taco shop, but it's not dirty or anything.  Get in there and enjoy!
