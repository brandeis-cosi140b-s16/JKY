What a treat to find good Mexican food on the Las Vegas strip. I tried it the other night and it was just like the good stuff you find on the taco trucks in Californica (ha ha). These are the authentic little 2 to 3 bite size tacos that has that flavor that keeps you coming back for more. Prices are insane for what it is and that is another reason I will be back. Good food, good price, decent little hangout for late night dining. Try it out Amigos!
