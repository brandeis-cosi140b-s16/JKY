I'm glad that the more recent reviews are positive because this place is criminally underrated at 3 stars. Most of the complaints appear to center around the place being overly busy (really?) or the service being poor. While the service certainly wasn't fantastic-our waiter disappeared on occasion and came off as cold, though he warmed up as the night went on-I don't think it warrants dropping the star rating. Started with the guacamole, which is overpriced but excellent - chunks of avocado with pomegranate seeds, fig, and a few other fresh items thrown in for good measure. I ordered the street tacos and each one was better than the previous - got the conchinita pibil, suedo azteca(brisket), and salmon y mango. The brisket in particular was incredibly tender and flavorful. They are on the small side but also stuffed with filling so I was satisfied after 3. My wife and I also split a coffee press, which was some of the best coffee I have ever tasted and cost us $3 for about two cups each. So, while the food may be somewhat expensive for what get in terms of size, it's also fresh, flavorful, and unique.
