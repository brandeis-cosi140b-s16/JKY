Downtown Las Vegas has another addition with the opening of La Comida, located off of Fremont and Sixth Street.  Mel C. and I were lucky enough to attend the invite-only/soft opening with our amigo Cisco, so I will preface this review by stating that it was definitely not the typical dining experience.  It was a first for me to meet Jenna and Michael Morton, the owners of La Comida, and part of the Morton dynasty - not typical.  I think every employee of La Comida was working last night and the place was bustling with all the excitement and, most likely, nerves that accompany opening a new and much-anticipated hot spot.  There were many Las Vegas celebs and higher-ups there, but I only recognized a few.  What stood out for me was the food and the ambiance.

I had:
La Catrina margarita:  "Cabrito tequila infused with strawberries, Combier, guava and limes"--so tasty and sweet, but not overly sweet, just the way I like my alcohol when I do drink.  I don't want to taste the alcohol.
Chips and salsa:  The salsa had a little kick, but not too spicy.
Guacamole:  Fresh!
Camaron del Golfo:  "Gulf shrimp, butternut squash, chorizo, cherry tomatoes, roasted corn, crema de Guajillo"- 3 big grilled shrimp with the other ingredients as a side medley--it was delicious.
Platanos Fritos:  3 fried plantains with vanilla ice cream--a sweet ending to a big meal.

It's exciting to have La Comida in DTLV, making Fremont East an even cooler place to hang out.  Word is that official opening is Thursday, April 25th, so check it out for yourselves--I will definitely be back, too.  

PS - I give the neon monkey sign 5 stars alone--I want one.
