This so far is my favorite Mexican restaurant in Scottsdale, however, I have only lived here for a couple of weeks. I am a big Mexican food lover, so this met my needs on many levels. The place is rather small, but it gives a more mom and pops, personal feel. The decor is Mexican which gives it a more authentic feel. I loved the salsa. It had a good garlic and spice combination. The food is rather cheap, but tasty. The service is very fast as well. 

I have yet to try many other Mexican restaurants, but I feel this one will still rank high with me because of the taste, speed, price and casual atmosphere it brings.
